Undying flames covered the distorted landscape under a blood-red sky. There, demons battled against each other for all eternity. They weren\'t fighting to see who was the strongest; all of the battles over the last ten millennia had already made that clear.</span></p><p><span>The demon king, who was considered the pinnacle of all evil, lived in an out-of-place castle in the desolate land at the heart of the Ninth Hell. He had managed to unify Hell, which had been divided into seven factions.</span></p><p><span>A young man with black hair sat on a giant white throne made with the bones of the seven princes of Hell. Although he was sitting there with his eyes closed, a breathtakingly strong demonic energy emanated from him, terrifying the thousands of demons kneeling on one knee in front of him.</span></p><p><span>One of the kneeling demons got up and walked slowly toward the throne. He was a demon over five meters tall. The demon had skin covered in red fur, a muscular body as sturdy as stone, horns resembling those of a goat on his forehead, sharp and protruding molars, and giant bat wings on his back.</span></p><p><span>He, who had the typical appearance of a demon, kneeled before the demon king and said, \"My king…\"</span></p><p><span>His name was Balrog. Despite being unmatched in the Nine Hells except against the seven princes, he called out to the young man in fear. It was bizarre to see Balrog, who was a monster in appearance, so afraid of someone who looked like a human being, but every single kneeling demon perfectly understood his fear.</span></p><p><span>The demon king had been an insignificant human when he fell into Hell ten millennia ago, but he had used his Authority of Predation to devour other demons.</span></p><p><span>After ten millennia, the human, who had grown by eating demons from the First to the Ninth Hell, became the lord of Hell. Hundreds of thousands of demons were eaten by his Authority. In the end, even the seven princes of Hell, who had been incapable of killing one another because they had each been too powerful, kneeled before him.</span></p><p><span>So, it was understandable that even the fearless Balrog would fear the pinnacle of all evil, the monster who had devoured countless demons of the Nine Hells.</span></p><p><span>\"Why are you trying to go back? You already have everything that you could possibly desire here in Hell,\" Balrog asked while trembling in fear.</span></p><p><span>The young man slowly opened his eyes, and even stronger demonic energy surged from him.</span></p><p><span>\"I have everything? Like what?\"</span></p><p><span>\"…\"</span></p><p><span>Oh Kang-Woo\'s voice echoed from his figure on the throne as his face distorted in rage.</span></p><p><span>\"There\'s nothing for me to have here. Enlighten me on what exactly there is here for me to have.\"</span></p><p><span>One could hear the clear depression in his voice.</span></p><p><span>\"There\'s nothing to eat, and there\'s no form of entertainment. I\'m not sure what this damn place has that makes you say I have everything.\"</span></p><p><span>There was nothing but a desolate landscape, a red sky, and undying flames in these nine Hells.</span></p><p><span>Balrog\'s eyes widened as he asked, \"Were you hungry? I just recently obtained food worthy of my king. Guys! Bring that out!\"</span></p><p><span>\"Yes, sir!\"</span></p><p><span>A group of demons brought out a giant plate at Balrog\'s command. On it was the head of a demon that was spouting out blood.</span></p><p><span>\"We recently defeated Focalor, the one leading the largest remnant force of the seven princes. My king, although this may not satisfy you since you have already devoured countless demons, please accept this offering from your loyal underling!\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo scowled at Focalor\'s grotesque head, saying, \"I don\'t need it, dumbass.\"</span></p><p><em><span>Shatter!</span></em></p><p><span>He threw the plate containing Focalor\'s head to the ground and stomped his feet hard on the floor with his fists clenched.</span></p><p><span>\"I don\'t want to eat something so grotesque and tasteless! I… I…!\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo\'s fists trembled.</span></p><p><span>He then said desperately, \"Kimchi stew… I want to eat Kimchi stew.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Kimchi stew!\"</span></p><p><span>\"The ultimate food that the Emperor of Predation desires!\"</span></p><p><span>\"A food full of blood and meat!\"</span></p><p><span>\"No… No, you idiots!\" Kang-Woo cried out while clenching his fists.</span></p><p><span>Although meat was an ingredient of kimchi stew, it probably wasn\'t anything close to what the demons were imagining.</span></p><p><span>Balrog looked at Kang-Woo with eyes blazing with loyalty. \"Which being\'s head is it made of? Or maybe an organ? Please just say the word, and I will tear anyone and anything apart and offer it to my king.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Kimchi stew isn\'t that kind of food…\" Kang-Woo expressed while suppressing his frustration. They were driving him to the edge of madness.</span></p><p><span>Explaining what food was to a demon didn\'t make sense from the beginning. After all, food for demons was nothing more than the right they held over the loser if they won a battle.</span></p><p><span>\"And there\'s no entertainment…?

But if we\'re talking about women, you have me, Lilith.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Lilith!\"</span></p><p><span>\"The succubus queen!\"</span></p><p><span>\"The most beautiful woman in Hell!\"</span></p><p><span>One of the kneeling demons approached Kang-Woo.</span></p><p><span>\"Is my affection not enough for you, my king?\" Lilith asked seductively as she caressed Kang-Woo\'s arm with dozens of her tentacles.</span></p><p><span>The eighteen eyes covering her entire face radiated a mellow atmosphere.</span></p><p><span>\"…\"</span></p><p><span>Eighteen eyes, dozens of squirming tentacles coming out from all over her body, and a snake tongue… Kang-Woo laid his hand on his forehead as if he was getting a headache from looking at Lilith, who was considered the most beautiful woman in Hell.</span></p><p><span>\"Why… Why does a succubus look like… Just why…\" Kang-Woo muttered.</span></p><p><span>The succubi that lived by absorbing a male\'s sexual energy had been far from the beautiful women that Kang-Woo had known them to be. From his point of view, Lilith looked more grotesque than Balrog. It wasn\'t just Lilith; the rest of the succubi also looked like her.</span></p><p><span>\"I will come join you in your chambers tonight.\"</span></p><p><span>\"No… Please don\'t.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Oh, my. Fufu. Don\'t be so embarrassed. How could you call yourself the lord of the Nine Hells like that?\"</span></p><p><span>\"You\'d better not come…\"</span></p><p><span>\"My, how cute. Fufu, you don\'t need to be so embarrassed. I, Lilith, will forever serve you by your side.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Please, just leave me alone…\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo hung his head forward and covered his face with his hands. He wasn\'t the kind of person to judge people based on their appearance, nor did he believe that appearance was an important factor in love. Still…</span></p><p><em><span>\'This is too much.\'</span></em></p><p><span>This wasn\'t a matter of whether she was pretty or ugly; her appearance just didn\'t fit human aesthetic standards.</span></p><p><span>\"Earth…\" Kang-Woo muttered while clenching his fists in desperation. \"I must return to Earth…\"</span></p><p><span>His subordinates could not change his mind. It actually only made his decision firmer.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I\'m going back.\'</span></em></p><p><span>A few days ago, Kang-Woo managed to devour Bael, the last remaining prince of Hell standing against him. With that, Kang-Woo managed to become the demon king.</span></p><p><span>All the preparations were now complete.

The items he\'d asked them to prepare were armaments that had belonged to the seven princes of Hell. Each of the weapons had the strength of the Nine Hells inside them. It was said that if one managed to gather all seven of them, one would gain enough power to twist the boundary between time and space.</span></p><p><span>After killing Bael a little while ago, Kang-Woo had managed to collect all of the equipment, and they were all lined up neatly in front of him now.</span></p><p><span>\"The preparations are complete.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Okay.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo slowly stood up from the throne and walked toward the seven armaments of different shapes and colors. The seven armaments that held the power of the Nine Hells were interacting with each other and amplifying the demonic energy inside each of them.</span></p><p><em><span>\'If I infuse the demonic energy that I\'ve absorbed into them…\'</span></em></p><p><span>It was possible to forcibly open a dimensional rift.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo sighed. He couldn\'t believe that he was finally about to return to Earth.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Finally…\'</span></em></p><p><span>He was going back.</span></p><p><em><span>Fwoooom!</span></em></p><p><span>A huge amount of demonic energy flowed from his body toward the armaments. He had devoured hundreds of thousands of demons through the Authority of Predation. He had so much demonic energy inside of him that it would be no exaggeration to say that he was the embodiment of the Nine Hells.</span></p><p><span>\'Ten Thousand Demon Core\' was what Kang-Woo used to describe the giant ball of demonic energy inside his body. He thought it was an appropriate name since there weren\'t many famous demons that he hadn\'t devoured.</span></p><p><span>The demonic energy that came from the Ten Thousand Demon Core began to interact with the seven armaments. A rift was formed in the space, and a black gate appeared before him.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I can finally return to Earth.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Remnants of his memories from Earth came back to him. Even after ten millennia, he hadn\'t been able to forget about his home. It wasn\'t like he had a family waiting for him, nor did he have a partner whom he had promised to spend the rest of his life with. However…</span></p><p><em><span>\'I\'m sure it\'ll still be far better than this place.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo was willing to do anything to be able to get away from this place that had no good food or entertainment, just blood and slaughter.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I also need to adjust the time.\'</span></em></p><p><span>He had no intention of returning to an Earth where ten millennia had passed. Many of the things that he missed about Earth were probably no longer around after that much time.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Kimchi stew might have disappeared.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo didn\'t even want to think about an Earth without kimchi stew. He wanted to return to the past, to the Earth from before he had arrived in the Hells. Thankfully, he could also adjust time by using the armaments of the seven princes of Hell.</span></p><p><span>\"Well then, see ya,\" Kang-Woo expressed.</span></p><p><span>\"My king…\"</span></p><p><span>After hearing the determination in Kang-Woo\'s words, Balrog lowered his head in sadness.</span></p><p><span>Tears dripped from all eighteen of Lilith\'s eyes while she opened her long mouth and said, \"</span><em><span>Sniff</span></em><span>, a-are you really going to abandon me?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Don\'t cry,\" Kang-Woo replied.</span></p><p><em><span>\'You look terrifying,\'</span></em><span> he remarked inwardly.</span></p><p><span>The sight of Lilith crying was straight out of a scene from a horror movie. It seemed like she\'d misunderstood his words.</span></p><p><span>She shouted as her tentacles trembled, \"Oh! Your kind words have moved me! My heart is about to burst from your love.\"</span></p><p><span>After saying that, one of the tentacles linked to Lilith\'s chest exploded, and yellow pus came out of it.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Oh, heavens,\'</span></em><span> Kang-Woo thought.</span></p><p><span>\"My king! My love!\"</span></p><p><em><span>\'Stay away from me.\'</span></em></p><p><span>\"Ahh, I will go with you, my king!\"</span></p><p><em><span>\'Screw off.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Upon seeing Lilith, who was covered in yellow pus, approach him, Kang-Woo threw himself into the dimensional rift.</span></p><p><span>\"My king! I, Lilith, will come find you, no matter what happens!\"</span></p><p><span>When Kang-Woo heard the chilling shout ring out behind him, a weird sensation swept through his body.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Let\'s never meet again.\'</span></em></p><p><span>While raising his middle finger toward Lilith—no, the Hells that had made him suffer for ten millennia, Kang-Woo regulated the boundary of time inside the dimension.</span></p><p><em><span>\'This is pretty hard.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Controlling an absolute entity such as time was a difficult task, even for him. Kang-Woo was trying to adjust the time settings to be as similar to the period when he fell into the Hells as possible.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I\'m okay with a difference of around ten or twenty years.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Because he had been born an orphan, there wasn\'t a past he wanted to change or a future he wanted to go to. He was okay as long as some of the Earth he remembered was still there.</span></p><p><em><span>Fwoooosh!</span></em></p><p><span>\"Urgh!\"</span></p><p><span>When he finished setting up the time, a strong force sucked him in. Kang-Woo closed his eyes as he was pulled by a force he couldn\'t resist.</span></p><p><em><span>- A Rift Core has been detected.</span></em></p><p><em><span>- Activating the Dimensional Defense Mechanism \'Gaia System.\'</span></em></p><p><em><span>- Fail.

However, his thoughts did not last long.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Ah…\'</span></em></p><p><span>The world seemed to distort as he lost consciousness.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span>***</span></p><p><span>\"Urgghhh…!\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo felt an intense pain weighing on his body. He was struggling to even move a finger.</span></p><p><span>After coming back to his senses, Kang-Woo opened his eyes while groaning.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Where am I?\'</span></em></p><p><span>The first thing he saw was a dense forest. The light shining through the thick bushes tickled Kang-Woo\'s cheeks.</span></p><p><span>\"Fuu…\" Kang-Woo stood up while taking a deep breath.</span></p><p><span>The pain that was spreading through his body made him feel dizzy.</span></p><p><em><span>\'First, I need to check my status.\'</span></em></p><p><span>He needed to know what had happened to his body.</span></p><p><em><span>Riiing!</span></em></p><p><span>[Opening the Status Window.]</span></p><p><span>\"Eh?\"</span></p><p><span>The moment he thought that he should check his current status, a blue window opened in front of his eyes. Kang-Woo narrowed his eyes to stare at the unexpected blue status window in front of him.</span></p><p><span>[Status Window]</span></p><p><span>[Player Name: Oh Kang-Woo</span></p><p><span>Level: 1 (First Awakening)</span></p><p><span>First Awakening Trait: Authority of Predation (Rank: ???) *The majority of the trait\'s power is currently sealed.</span></p><p><span>Strength: 8</span></p><p><span>Dexterity: 9</span></p><p><span>Health: 7</span></p><p><span>Mana: 0</span></p><p><span>Demonic Energy (Unique Stat): 12</span></p><p><span>Intelligence: 8</span></p><p><span>Wisdom: 7]</span></p><p><span>\"… What the hell is this?\"</span></p><p><span>The status window reminded him of the games that he used to play a long time ago before falling into the Hells.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo frowned at the phenomenon he couldn\'t get a grasp on.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Most of the power of Predation has been sealed?\'</span></em></p><p><span>Authority of Predation was the only power he\'d had when he had fallen into the Hells, and it was what had made him the lord of the Nine Hells. It was the authority that lay dormant within the Ten Thousand Demon Core, which he considered the entirety of his power.</span></p><p><span>The moment Kang-Woo read that the strength he had accumulated for ten millennia had been sealed, he started to feel anxious.</span></p><p><span>\"Fuu.\" Kang-Woo took a deep breath and tried to calm down.</span></p><p><span>Being anxious because something unexpected happened would only make things worse.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Calm down.\'</span></em></p><p><span>The most important thing was checking out his current status. Kang-Woo tried to bring out the strength of his Ten Thousand Demon Core, which contained the demonic energy of hundreds of thousands of demons.</span></p><p><em><span>\'It isn\'t moving.\'</span></em></p><p><span>To be more precise, he could only move a tiny bit of his demonic energy by will—which was almost nothing, considering the limitless amount of demonic energy it contained.</span></p><p><span>\"At this rate, I\'ll have trouble using my Authorities as well,\" Kang-Woo mumbled while frowning.</span></p><p><span>A few demons possessed a special Authority similar to his Authority of Predation. Among the hundreds of thousands of demons he had devoured, only six hundred and sixty-six of them had possessed an Authority. Apart from the ones that the seven princes of Hell used to have, he could use the rest.</span></p><p><span>Each Authority required a certain amount of demonic energy to activate, although the amount required varied between them. With the amount of demonic energy he currently had access to, there were more Authorities he couldn\'t use than ones he could.</span></p><p><em><span>\'With my current demonic energy, I\'ll probably struggle with even the Authority of Blades.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Authority of Blades was the Authority of the demon Sabnak. It allowed one to pull out blades made of demonic energy from one\'s body.</span></p><p><em><span>\'But it isn\'t a good Authority.\'</span></em></p><p><span>There were ways in which he could use the Authority of Blades effectively with enough demonic energy, but it would be difficult with the amount that he had right now.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo focused on his left hand and used the Authority of Blades.</span></p><p><em><span>Schwiiing!</span></em></p><p><span>A sharp black blade sprang out from the back of his left hand. He felt the demonic energy leaving his body.</span></p><p><em><span>\'It\'s hard getting used to it.\'</span></em></p><p><span>It was stifling to go from having unlimited demonic energy to it being limited. At present, he couldn\'t freely use the Authorities he had access to as he had done before.</span></p><p><span>\"Anyway, it seems like the information on this status window is true.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo didn\'t know why his Authority had been sealed, but it was true that he couldn\'t use most of the demonic energy he had stored inside the Ten Thousand Demon Core. That meant that the status window in front of him showed exactly his current state.</span></p><p><span>\"… Am I actually inside a game?\"</span></p><p><span>At that point, the thought of whether or not this was truly Earth made Kang-Woo feel a bit anxious.</span></p><p><span>\"Skree, skree!\"</span></p><p><span>He suddenly heard an ear-splitting sound. Kang-Woo turned toward where the sound had come from.</span></p><p><span>\"Damn it.\"</span></p><p><span>He scowled upon finding out what had made such an unpleasant sound. It was a small creature with green skin, sharp teeth, and a height that reached Kang-Woo\'s chest. The creature was as ugly as one of the monsters that roamed around the First Hell. There weren\'t monsters like these on the Earth that Kang-Woo knew.</span></p><p><span>\"Is this… seriously not Earth?\" Kang-Woo murmured in despair.</span></p><p><span>He couldn\'t even laugh at the thought that the place he had come to after ten millennia of suffering might not be Earth.</span></p><p><span>\"Skreeee!!\"</span></p><p><span>Upon seeing Kang-Woo, the green monsters charged toward him.</span></p></div><div><span></span></div><!--$--><!--/$-->'),(3,1,'Chapter 3 - The Lord of the Nine Hells Returns to Earth (3)',_binary '<div style=\"font-size:16px;color:#E0E0E0;font-family:Open Sans;line-height:24px\" prose=\"xl\" class=\"fr-view prose max-w-none dark:prose-invert relative dark:text-white mb-[97px] sm:mb-[50px] ww-uajudi\"><p><em><span>\'Just… what went wrong?\'</span></em></p><p><span>Oh Kang-Woo was sure he had opened a gate to Earth. He had also felt the same sensation from ten millennia ago when he was dragged into the dimensional rift.</span></p><p><span>Amid this desperate situation, Kang-Woo fell into confusion.</span></p><p><span>\"Skreeee!\" the green monsters shrieked even louder when they saw that their prey wasn\'t moving.</span></p><p><span>Then they swung their crude knives at Kang-Woo.</span></p><p><em><span>Slash!</span></em></p><p><span>\"Kiiiik!\"</span></p><p><span>Yet, the arm of one of the green monsters fell to the ground from an instant slash of a black blade.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo turned his body around and swung the blade he had created with the Authority of Blades. Although most of his demonic energy had been sealed, he was still the demon king who ruled over the Nine Hells. There was no way he wouldn\'t be able to win against such worthless opponents.</span></p><p><em><span>\'First, I should take care of these guys.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Regardless, he didn\'t have time to think about anything else right now. Enemies were charging at him with their lives on the line.</span></p><p><span>As Kang-Woo glared at the monsters that were leaping toward him from all directions, he exuded a bloodlust similar to that of a beast.</span></p><p><span>\"Kiee?!\"</span></p><p><span>Upon sensing Kang-Woo\'s killing intent, the green monsters trembled.</span></p><p><em><span>\'There are around eight of them,\'</span></em><span> Kang-Woo observed inwardly.</span></p><p><span>If he had access to his Ten Thousand Demon Core, he would be able to kill the green monsters without even moving; all he would need to do was release some energy. Nevertheless, he couldn\'t do that right now.</span></p><p><span>\"It\'s been a long time since I\'ve moved my body like this.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo stepped lightly and dodged the attacks of the crazed green monsters. He then cut their necks with a blade made of demonic energy.</span></p><p><em><span>Slash!</span></em></p><p><span>\"Skreee!\"</span></p><p><span>Thanks to all of the battle experience Kang-Woo had gained through the years, the monsters died without being able to deal any damage to him.</span></p><p><em><span>Riiing!</span></em></p><p><span>[You have successfully defeated the E-rank common monster, Goblin.]</span></p><p><span>[Increasing EXP.]</span></p><p><span>[Your level has risen to 3.]</span></p><p><em><span>\'Level up?\'</span></em></p><p><span>Blue message windows appeared before him after the Goblins died. When Kang-Woo opened the status window again, he found that he had risen from Level 1 to 3.</span></p><p><em><span>\'My stats went up as well.\'</span></em></p><p><span>His strength, health, and dexterity stats had risen by one point each. Furthermore, it wasn\'t simply just an increase in the stats numbers. He could also feel his body get stronger, albeit only slightly.</span></p><p><span>\"But that\'s not the important thing here.\"</span></p><p><span>Right now, it didn\'t matter if his level went up or if his stats increased. What he needed to do was confirm if he was currently on Earth and if there were even humans here.</span></p><p><span>\"Tsk, in situations like this, it would be more comfortable if I could use Alloces\' Authority.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo smiled bitterly while thinking of the Authority that would let him fly freely through the skies. The Authority of the Sky allowed him to ignore gravity and move freely through the air, so it required a lot of demonic energy. However, with his current amount of demonic energy, he would only be able to jump high.</span></p><p><span>He then walked toward the Goblins\' corpses.</span></p><p><em><span>\'It would be great if I could obtain more information about this unknown world.\'</span></em></p><p><span>He extended his hands toward the Goblins\' corpses and murmured in a low voice, \"Predation.\"</span></p><p><span>Authority of Predation, the ultimate Authority that had allowed him to become the lord of the Nine Hells, was activated. Black demonic energy flowed out of his hand and covered the corpses of the Goblins.</span></p><p><em><span>Crush! Crunch!&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><span>Creepy sounds rang out as the mass of black energy surrounding the Goblins\' corpses reduced in size. Kang-Woo then began receiving information about the Goblins in his mind.</span></p><p><span>With the Authority of Predation, he couldn\'t read the target\'s memories, but he could get their biometric information, such as the Goblins\' physical characteristics, habits, how they lived their daily lives, and what their weaknesses were. However, the biometric information did not have anything that could help him know more about the world that he had found himself in.</span></p><p><span>\"Damn it,\" he cursed, feeling disappointed.</span></p><p><span>Suddenly…</span></p><p><span>\"Hmm?\"</span></p><p><span>While absorbing the Goblins\' energy with Predation, Kang-Woo felt a very familiar energy.</span></p><p><em><span>\'This is…\'</span></em></p><p><span>There was only a very small amount of it, but his senses could not be deceived. Kang-Woo\'s eyes lit up.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Demonic energy.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Inside the Goblins\' bodies was a very tiny amount of demonic energy.</span></p><p><em><span>Riiing!</span></em></p><p><span>[Demonic Energy has risen by 1.]</span></p><p><span>As if confirming his guess, he got a message saying that his demonic energy stat had increased. With that, he felt the demonic energy inside his body expand and thicken.</span></p><p><span>\"… Damn it.\"</span></p><p><span>Although Kang-Woo\'s demonic energy had increased, what came out of his mouth were curses.</span></p><p><span>Demonic energy was an energy that everyone in the Nine Hells possessed. So, finding that energy here meant that the probability of this place not being Earth had increased.</span></p><p><em><span>\'No…\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo was starting to get anxious. The only reason he had managed to endure the Nine Hells all this time had been his hope of being able to return to Earth one day.</span></p><p><span>Memories of all the years he had spent among demons whose only interests were fighting and killing each other flooded into his mind.</span></p><p><span>\"This can\'t be happening.\"</span></p><p><span>He felt even more frustrated than all those times when he was almost driven to death while fighting against a prince of Hell.</span></p><p><span>\"Kyaaaa!\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo suddenly heard a scream from far away, and his hopeless eyes came back to life.</span></p><p><span>\"This…\"</span></p><p><span>It wasn\'t the voice of a demon or a monster. He could sense that the shout belonged to a human, but more importantly…</span></p><p><span>\"It\'s a woman.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo started to tremble as a shiver swept through him.</span></p><p><span>The echo of the scream seemed to spread through his entire body, right into his soul.</span></p><p><span>\"A woman!\"</span></p><p><span>If someone were to have heard him, they would probably think he was a pervert. Regardless, he didn\'t have enough mental space to think about his dignity right now.</span></p><p><span>It had been ten millennia. For ten millennia, he hadn\'t been able to even look at a video in which a woman appeared. So, it would be strange if he could stay rational in this situation.</span></p><p><em><span>Stomp!</span></em></p><p><span>With aggressive steps, Kang-Woo ran over to where the scream was coming from. Simultaneously, he activated the Authority of Haste, the Authority of the demon Valefor.</span></p><p><span>Demonic energy flowed out of his body and pooled around his legs. The demonic energy inside his body was depleted swiftly, and his body shot forward like an arrow.</span></p><p><span>Although this was a frighteningly fast speed for an ordinary human, it felt slow for Kang-Woo.</span></p><p><em><span>\'If only I had more demonic energy!\'</span></em></p><p><span>If he had access to all the demonic energy inside his Ten Thousand Demon Core, then he would be able to move at speeds so fast it would be like teleporting. Kang-Woo couldn\'t help but feel resentful that he couldn\'t do so.</span></p><p><span>\"Kiieekk!\"</span></p><p><span>\"Kyaaaaa!\"</span></p><p><span>The screams got clearer. There were also shouts similar to those of the Goblins that had attacked Kang-Woo earlier.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I just hope it isn\'t a monster like Lilith!\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo was fine with it if the woman was ugly. She could even be fat. He was okay as long as she had two eyes, one nose, and one mouth.</span></p><p><em><span>\'And no tentacles, please!\'</span></em></p><p><span>He kept focusing his demonic energy on his feet while thinking about Lilith\'s absolutely horrifying tentacles.</span></p><p><span>For the first time in many years, Kang-Woo felt out of breath. He felt frustrated by how breathless he was just from running. The fight had not even begun yet.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I found her.\'</span></em></p><p><span>As he moved through some dense grass, he found an open space. There, he saw a frightened woman surrounded by more than ten Goblins. She was pressing her hands on her leg wounds to stem the blood loss.</span></p><p><span>\"Ah…\" a gasp emerged from Kang-Woo\'s mouth.</span></p><p><span>The moment he saw the woman surrounded by a group of Goblins, he shuddered.</span></p><p><span>The woman had black hair that reached her waist, big eyes, thick lips, and a high nose bridge. She even had a small mole near the left side of her mouth. She was so pretty that if one saw her on the street, one would have instinctively turned around.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, her beauty wasn\'t important to Kang-Woo right now.</span></p><p><em><span>\'She\'s human.\'</span></em></p><p><span>The main point was that the woman was a human… with two eyes, one mouth, and one nose. She was just a simple human who didn\'t have tentacles from which pus emerged, nor did she have bat wings or red fur covering her body.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Thank heavens…\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo was so touched that he wanted to thank the god who had ignored him for the past ten millennia.</span></p><p><span>\"Grrrrr!\"</span></p><p><span>\"Ugh!\"</span></p><p><span>As the Goblins charged at the woman with rusty knives, she closed her eyes. The sight of the knives swinging in her direction made her think she would die there.</span></p><p><em><span>Clash!</span></em></p><p><span>\"Kiieekk?!\" the Goblins shouted in surprise.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo suddenly appeared, moving swiftly like an agile beast as he killed the Goblins.</span></p><p><span>\"Huh?\" The eyes of the black-haired woman widened.</span></p><p><span>She couldn\'t believe what she was seeing. Kang-Woo had slayed the group of more than ten Goblins in just a few seconds.</span></p><p><em><span>Stab!</span></em></p><p><span>\"Kiieekk!\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo\'s black blade cut the neck of the last Goblin.</span></p><p><span>After twisting the blade and completely slicing through the Goblin\'s neck, Kang-Woo approached the woman sitting on the ground.</span></p><p><span>\"Th-Thank you,\" the woman said.</span></p><p><span>Although hurt, she stood up with some struggle and bowed to him. Kang-Woo grabbed her hands and helped her maintain her balance.</span></p><p><span>\"Ah…\" Kang-Woo gasped the moment he grabbed the woman\'s hands.</span></p><p><span>That soft sensation was something he couldn\'t have felt in the Nine Hells. She was definitely human—the species that he had wanted to see and interact with so much for all this time.</span></p><p><span>Overwhelmed by his emotions, Kang-Woo\'s mind went blank. All the emotions he had forced himself to suppress had exploded and blocked off his rationality.</span></p><p><span>\"My name is Han Seol-Ah. Thank you for saving me,\" the woman said.</span></p><p><span>She was surprised to see Kang-Woo feel so moved while grabbing her hands. Nevertheless, she bowed again without freeing her hands from his grip.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo gazed at Han Seol-Ah and stated in a serious tone, \"Let\'s get married.\"</span></p><p><span>\"What?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Three kids sounds good.\"</span></p><p><span>\"What…?\"</span></p></div><div><span></span></div><!--$--><!--/$-->'),(4,1,'Chapter 4 - Unfamiliar Earth, Familiar Scenery (1)',_binary '<div style=\"font-size:16px;color:#E0E0E0;font-family:Open Sans;line-height:24px\" prose=\"xl\" class=\"fr-view prose max-w-none dark:prose-invert relative dark:text-white mb-[97px] sm:mb-[50px] ww-uajudi\"><p><span>\"Uhm… What do you mean…?\" Han Seol-Ah gazed at Oh Kang-Woo disconcertedly.</span></p><p><span>It looked like she didn\'t know whether to get angry or thank him.</span></p><p><span>\"Oh, I\'m sorry,\" Kang-Woo said.</span></p><p><span>He let go of Seol-Ah\'s hand and shook his head to try to regain his rationality.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I need to get a hold of myself.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Since Kang-Woo had been lucky enough to find another person, he couldn\'t let her think he was crazy.</span></p><p><span>\"I\'m Oh Kang-Woo. You said that your name\'s Han Seol-Ah, right? Are you hurt?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Yes, but it isn\'t a big injury—Ugh!\"</span></p><p><span>The pain in Seol-Ah\'s leg caused her to groan and fall to the ground. As she fell, a small rectangular object tumbled from her pockets.</span></p><p><em><span>\'It\'s a smartphone,\'</span></em><span> Kang-Woo realized.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo\'s eyes lit up. The object was definitely something he had a faint memory of—a smartphone.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Could this really be… Earth?\'</span></em></p><p><span>The smartphone, the obviously Korean name \'Han Seol-Ah,\' and most of all…</span></p><p><em><span>\'I can converse with her.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo wasn\'t talking to Seol-Ah in the language of the demons; he was using the human language he had used before falling to Hell. The fact that they could communicate meant he was indeed on Earth, and Seol-Ah was Korean.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I\'m glad I kept practicing it so I wouldn\'t forget it.\'</span></em></p><p><span>In Hell, Kang-Woo had taught Korean to his underlings and forbidden them to use the demonic language, forcing them to use Korean instead.</span></p><p><span>\"Are you okay?\" Kang-Woo asked Seol-Ah.</span></p><p><em><span>Riiip!</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo ripped apart one of his garments and used it to bind the wound on Seol-Ah\'s leg. This was a rare Hell-made garment, made with fabrics that were hard to get in Hell because most demons didn\'t understand the concept of putting clothes on.</span></p><p><span>\"Ah… Yes, thank you.\"</span></p><p><span>A slight blush crept up Seol-Ah\'s cheeks as she looked up at Kang-Woo, who had turned his garment into bandages for her leg without hesitation.</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah had been wary of him initially because he had said weird things such as </span><em><span>\"Let\'s get married,\"</span></em><span> and</span><em><span>&nbsp;\"Three kids would be&nbsp;</span></em><em><span>okay</span></em><em><span>.\"&nbsp;</span></em><span>However, Kang-Woo\'s warm actions melted that wariness.</span></p><p><span>\"Thank you for helping me,\" Seol-Ah said.</span></p><p><span>If it hadn\'t been for Kang-Woo, Seol-Ah would\'ve been killed by Goblins… or worse.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I\'ve heard that, among monsters, there are some that lust over humans,\'</span></em><span> Seol-Ah thought.</span></p><p><span>With that in mind, Kang-Woo was very much her savior, so she felt guilty for having doubted him even a little.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I\'m very grateful to him.\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>Seol-Ah nodded to herself, and her lips widened into a smile.</span></p><p><span>It hadn\'t been long since she had awakened as a Player, but she had heard many things about them, such as that they wouldn\'t hesitate to betray a party member for profit. Although not everyone was that selfish, it was odd for a Player to come running to help someone just from hearing them scream.</span></p><p><span>\"Take it easy,\" Kang-Woo advised.</span></p><p><span>\"Okay,\" Seol-Ah replied.</span></p><p><span>Seeing the smile on Seol-Ah\'s face, Kang-Woo smiled too. </span><em><span>\'Good.\'</span></em></p><p><span>It meant a lot to him that he had managed to get on her good side.</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah was very important to Kang-Woo. Not only was she the first human he had met after returning from Hell, but she was also a great source of information for him.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Why have monsters like this appeared on Earth?\'</span></em></p><p><span>The Earth he was on now was too different from the one that he remembered, and Seol-Ah was the only person who could explain such things to him at present.</span></p><p><em><span>\'First…\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo grabbed the phone that had fallen out of Seol-Ah\'s pocket, pressed the home button, and saw the information he wanted to know the most.</span></p><p><span>[May 22, 2023 3:34 PM]</span></p><p><em><span>\'2023?\'</span></em></p><p><span>It had been 2018 when he fell into Hell, so that meant that he was now five years in the future from that day.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I didn\'t fail in controlling the time of return.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo had been prepared for a time difference of ten or even twenty years. The time difference of just five years meant that he had done a better job than he had expected. However, way too many things had changed on Earth in just five years.</span></p><p><em><span>\'It has only been five years, yet such monsters appeared on Earth during that time?\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo couldn\'t figure out what might have happened during the past five years for there to now be monsters on Earth like those Goblins that roamed freely in the forest.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I need more information on the current situation.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo turned his head around toward Seol-Ah and said, \"Here\'s your smartphone.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Oh, thank you very much.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Why were you in a place like this?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Ugh…\" Seol-Ah groaned at that question. Then she replied quietly, \"I have… a situation, so I tried solo-hunting a Gate. Haha. I just awakened as a Player, yet I tried hunting in an E-rank Gate… I was stupid.\"</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah was very reproachful of herself.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, Kang-Woo\'s eyes lit up. </span><em><span>\'Gate, Player.\'</span></em></p><p><span>\'Gate\' probably referred to the place where they currently were.</span></p><p><em><span>\'And as for awakening as a Player…\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo remembered his status window. There had clearly been a \'Player Name\' category.</span></p><p><span>\"What\'s your current level?\" Kang-Woo asked her naturally.</span></p><p><span>\"I\'ve just awakened, so I\'m Level 6. But what\'s a high-level Player like you doing in an E-rank Gate?\"</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah thought Kang-Woo was a high-level Player, despite him being only Level 3.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I guess it\'s obvious she would think that,\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>Kang-Woo thought.</span></p><p><span>He had annihilated a group of Goblins she had been struggling to deal with. If the Level she was talking about was the stat that indicated how strong someone was, then it was natural that she would mistake him for a high-level player.</span></p><p><span>\"I have my reasons,\" Kang-Woo replied.</span></p><p><span>\"Oh… I see.\" Seol-Ah just nodded instead of persisting with the topic, as Kang-Woo was clearly dodging her question.</span></p><p><span>It wasn\'t normal for high-level Players to come to a low-ranking Gate, but if Kang-Woo didn\'t want to tell her the reason, Seol-Ah had no right to ask any further.</span></p><p><span>\"Ugh…\" Seol-Ah groaned again.</span></p><p><span>\"Can you stand up?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Yes. Thanks to your help, I think I can walk a bit.\"</span></p><p><span>\"I\'ll help you.\"</span></p><p><span>\"N-No. It\'s okay. I don\'t want to bother you anymore…\"</span></p><p><span>\"Refusing an offer isn\'t the same as being modest.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo grabbed her arm. Feeling a warm blush rush into her cheeks, Seol-Ah lowered her head embarrassedly.</span></p><p><span>\"Which way should we go?\" Kang-Woo asked.</span></p><p><span>\"Th-This way.\"</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah was so embarrassed that she didn\'t even think about why a high-level Player like Kang-Woo didn\'t even know where the Gate portal was and just pointed out the direction with her finger.</span></p><p><span>\"Let\'s go, then,\" Kang-Woo said.</span></p><p><span>With Kang-Woo supporting Seol-Ah, they began slowly walking toward the Gate.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Thankfully, it doesn\'t seem like she\'s suspicious of anything,\'</span></em><span> Kang-Woo thought.</span></p><p><span>There was no way Seol-Ah would know of Kang-Woo\'s real identity, but he wanted to avoid seeming like a suspicious person.</span></p><p><em><span>\'She\'ll probably think I\'m crazy.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo didn\'t want the first woman he saw in ten millennia—a pretty one at that—to think he was crazy. The first step of his return to Earth was to integrate into society as naturally as possible.</span></p><p><span>While thinking that, he subtly changed his walking pace to match Seol-Ah\'s.</span></p><p><span>\"This…\" Kang-Woo muttered.</span></p><p><span>\"We\'ve reached the portal,\" Seol-Ah stated.</span></p><p><em><span>Whirrr.</span></em></p><p><span>Seol-Ah was pointing at a white Gate. It was around thirty meters tall and much bigger than the pitch-black Gate that Kang-Woo had gone through to return to Earth.</span></p><p><em><span>\'That means this place isn\'t technically Earth.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Since people had to go through a Gate to get here, that meant that this forest where monsters roamed freely wasn\'t actually Earth.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Is it a place like Hell…?\'</span></em></p><p><span>It was similar to Hell in that it was a dimension that had to be entered through a Gate.</span></p><p><em><span>\'How is this Gate being maintained?\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo looked at the slightly-murky white Gate in amazement. He couldn\'t see any strong armaments, like the armaments of the seven princes of Hell, creating a dimensional rift.</span></p><p><span>\"Kang-Woo?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Oh, I\'m sorry. Let\'s get out of here.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo returned to his senses after Seol-Ah called his name, and he walked through the Gate while supporting her. As they crossed to the other side, the weird sensation of moving through different dimensions swept over them.</span></p><p><em><span>Murmur.</span></em></p><p><span>\"We\'re looking for party members to hunt Goblins in the E-rank Gate!\"</span></p><p><span>\"Recruiting tanks! Are there any tanks here?!\"</span></p><p><span>\"I\'m a rogue… Can I join your party?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Oh, sorry. We don\'t accept rogues.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo and Seol-Ah could hear people shouting everywhere as they walked out of the Gate. It was as if they had arrived at a marketplace.</span></p><p><span>\"Ah…\" Kang-Woo felt a thrill from looking at all the people gathered around the Gate.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Humans…\'</span></em></p><p><span>There were humans all around him.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I\'m really back…\'</span></em></p><p><span>Although this was an unfamiliar version of Earth, the sight of a crowd was familiar. Kang-Woo realized then that he had truly returned to Earth. All his doubts and fears disappeared, and energy spread throughout his body. Kang-Woo was so moved that his body even trembled a bit.</span></p><p><span>\"Uhmm… Kang-Woo,\" Seol-Ah carefully called his name.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo turned his head to look at her.</span></p><p><span>\"If it\'s okay with you, would you like to come to my house? I would like to at least treat you to dinner,\" Seol-Ah said in an apologetic tone while looking at Kang-Woo\'s clothes, which had been ripped to bind her wounded leg.</span></p><p><span>In reality, giving money as compensation would\'ve been the correct choice, but she did not have the financial ability for that at the moment. Nevertheless, she didn\'t just want to thank the person who had saved her life and then walk away.</span></p><p><span>\"…!\" Kang-Woo trembled some more after he heard her words.</span></p><p><span>It was unexpected that a girl would invite him to her house… Furthermore, it was the girl whom he had just helped. This was too stimulating for Kang-Woo, who had only met girls through his imagination for the past ten millennia.</span></p><p><span>He felt as if Seol-Ah had said, \'Oppa, would you like to come over and have some ramen?\'</span><span id=\"footnote-ref-42f8\"><a href=\"#footnote-42f8\"><span>[1]</span></a></span></p><p><em><span>\'This…\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo clenched his fists.

He imagined a happy life in a house with Seol-Ah and three kids.</span></p><p><em><span>\'There\'s a breeze!!!\'</span></em></p><p><span>A warm spring breeze was blowing in his heart that had rotted after spending ten millennia in Hell.</span></p><hr><div id=\"footnote-42f8\"><p><span>1.

Okay, then please follow me,\" Han Seol-Ah replied with a smile and turned around.</span></p><p><span>At that moment, a man who was in front of the Gate walked toward Kang-Woo and Seol-Ah. He was dressed in what seemed to be a military uniform.</span></p><p><span>\"Your Player license, please,\" the man said.</span></p><p><span>\"Oh, yes. Here you go.\" Seol-Ah nodded and showed him a license with \'E-rank\' written on it.</span></p><p><span>\"Thank you.\"</span></p><p><span>The man merely looked at Seol-Ah\'s Player license for a second before nodding in acknowledgement. It was as if doing this job bothered him.</span></p><p><span>This was a similar procedure to when employees asked for your identification card in a bar.</span></p><p><span>\"You too, sir,\" the man said to Kang-Woo.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Damn it.\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>Kang-Woo frowned a bit. </span><em><span>\'I wasn\'t expecting someone to ask for my license.\'</span></em></p><p><span>He was in trouble. Kang-Woo didn\'t have a Player license.</span></p><p><em><span>\'If I say I forgot it, I\'ll probably have to go through some long-winded process.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Without a license, things could get rather bothersome. After all, Kang-Woo had been missing for five years. This meant he was in a weird place regarding his identity. So, it wasn\'t even just that things could get bothersome; his plan of trying to integrate into society as naturally as possible could crumble as well.</span></p><p><em><span>\'But most importantly…\'</span></em></p><p><span>The great opportunity that he had spent ten millennia waiting for could fade away into nothing.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I must prevent that from happening.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Only an idiot would let an opportunity like that go.</span></p><p><span>\"Just a moment, please,\" Kang-Woo said and put his hand into his pocket.</span></p><p><span>Of course, there wasn\'t anything inside the pocket.</span></p><p><em><span>\'This Authority will be a bit difficult to use with my remaining demonic energy, but…\'</span></em></p><p><span>He remembered the attitude of the man when he checked Seol-Ah\'s license. The man had only looked at it for a second.</span></p><p><em><span>\'If it\'s only for that long…\'</span></em></p><p><span>It was worth a shot, even with Kang-Woo\'s current amount of demonic energy.</span></p><p><span>\"Here it is.\"</span></p><p><span>While saying that, Kang-Woo took out his hand from his pocket and showed his middle finger to the man.</span></p><p><span>Simultaneously, Kang-Woo activated one of his Authorities—the Authority of Blindness. It was Dantalion\'s Authority, and it distorted the target\'s perception and deceived their eyes. However, an enormous amount of demonic energy had to be consumed to produce this effect. The stronger the target, the more the amount of demon energy consumed would increase.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, the soldier checking the licenses seemed weaker than the Level-6 Seol-Ah. His eyes became blurry under the effect of the Authority of Blindness, and he nodded at Kang-Woo, who still had his middle finger raised.</span></p><p><span>\"Thank you,\" the soldier said.</span></p><p><span>It had been only for one second, but Kang-Woo felt as if most of his demonic energy had been drained from his body. Kang-Woo put his hand down while trying to control his breathing.</span></p><p><span>\"Then let\'s go.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Okay.\"</span></p><p><span>After that, Kang-Woo joined Seol-Ah, and they headed toward her home.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Finally,\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>Kang-Woo thought as he followed her with light steps.</span></p><p><span>Didn\'t people say that there was no end to a human\'s greed?</span></p><p><span>At first, Kang-Woo had said he would be okay with it as long as she had two eyes, one nose, and one mouth, but as time passed, he couldn\'t help but appreciate how beautiful Seol-Ah was.</span></p><p><span>He clenched his fists while thinking of everything that was about to happen.</span></p><p><em><span>\'YOLO!\'</span></em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span>***</span></p><p><span>\"This is my home.\"</span></p><p><span>The pair had arrived at a shabby-looking apartment.

Aren\'t you hurt anywhere?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Yes, I\'m okay,\" Seol-Ah replied.</span></p><p><span>\"You went to the Gate with a party like I\'d told you to, right?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Oh… Yes, of course,\" Seol-Ah mumbled while avoiding her mother\'s gaze. Then she glanced at Kang-Woo. \"This is Mr. Oh Kang-Woo. I met him inside the Gate. I found myself in a dangerous situation while hunting monsters, but I was able to get out safely thanks to him.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Oh! Th-Thank you very much!\" The middle-aged woman grabbed Kang-Woo\'s hand and bowed her head in gratitude.</span></p><p><span>It showed just how worried she had been about Seol-Ah entering the Gate.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Damn,\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>Kang-Woo cursed inwardly.</span></p><p><span>He wasn\'t listening to Seol-Ah\'s mother\'s words of gratitude at all.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I can\'t believe she really meant just dinner.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo looked at Seol-Ah dejectedly. The future that he had imagined having with her shattered. He felt as if the plane he was on had fallen down a cliff before it even gained enough speed to take off.</span></p><p><span>\"Kang-Woo…?\" Seol-Ah called out.</span></p><p><span>\"Oh, I\'m sorry. It\'s nothing,\" Kang-Woo replied quietly and shook his head.</span></p><p><span>It was his fault for having thought too far ahead, but he couldn\'t help feeling a little bit disappointed.</span></p><p><span>\"Haha. This place… isn\'t that great, is it? But don\'t worry. I\'m quite confident in my cooking skills,\" Seol-Ah said slightly gloomily.</span></p><p><span>She thought that Kang-Woo\'s disappointment was from seeing the state of her home.</span></p><p><span>\"Oh, it\'s not about that, so please don\'t worry,\" Kang-Woo clarified.</span></p><p><span>He had been born an orphan, so before falling to the Nine Hells, he\'d lived in a home smaller and more worn down than Seol-Ah\'s. Those had been miserable times when he struggled to eat and live each day.</span></p><p><em><span>\'But it was still better than Hell.\'</span></em></p><p><span>In the Nine Hells, he had to fight each day for his life. So, even though he had suffered from a lack of food on Earth, life here had been far better than in the Hells.</span></p><p><span>\"Come in, Kang-Woo.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Ahem, I\'m sorry for inviting you into such a shabby place…\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo entered the home while receiving a warm welcome from the mother and daughter.</span></p><p><span>The apartment had an approximate surface area of sixty-six square meters. It was quite spacious compared to how aged and withered it was.</span></p><p><span>\"Give me a few minutes, Kang-Woo. I\'ll get dinner ready immediately,\" Seol-Ah said.</span></p><p><span>\"Oh, can I ask something?\" Kang-Woo asked.</span></p><p><span>\"Yes, of course.\" Seol-Ah nodded without hesitation.</span></p><p><span>\"I\'ve lost my smartphone. Could you lend me yours for a little while?\" Kang-Woo asked her with a calm voice.</span></p><p><span>\"Oh! Sure thing.\" She took her smartphone from her pocket and gave it to him.</span></p><p><span>Taking a closer look at Seol-Ah\'s phone now, Kang-Woo saw that her phone was also quite old, with a long crack running across the screen. Additionally, he knew its exact model and generation number.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Considering that five years have passed…\'</span></em></p><p><span>He once again realized that their financial situation wasn\'t good.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I guess it\'s good enough to search up some articles on the internet.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo wanted to know what had happened on Earth in the past five years. Gates and Players—such things hadn\'t existed on the Earth that he knew from the past.</span></p><p><span>He slowly began reading articles from five years ago.</span></p><p><span>[February 22, 2018, the Day of Calamity.

It was also the day when Kang-Woo was absorbed by a pitch-black Gate and thrown down into the Nine Hells.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Does that mean I was absorbed by one of these Gates that suddenly appeared?\'</span></em></p><p><span>Considering the circumstances, that seemed the most likely answer.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo tried to search for some information on the Gate that had sent him to the Nine Hells for ten millennia, but he couldn\'t find anything. All available information was speculation, and none of them contained detailed explanations about what the Gates were.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I\'ll have to search for more information myself.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Maybe an important federal organization had information that wasn\'t publicly available. Kang-Woo decided he would infiltrate a federal organization later once his life became more stable and he had recovered his strength.</span></p><p><span>\"What are you searching for?\" Seol-Ah asked him while she was cooking.</span></p><p><span>\"I was looking at some news because there was something I needed to check,\" Kang-Woo replied.</span></p><p><span>\"I see. Then should I prepare dinner later?\"</span></p><p><span>\"No, it\'s okay. Let\'s eat as soon as it\'s ready.\"</span></p><p><span>Anyway, he understood the general situation now. It was better to go looking for answers to his questions on his own.</span></p><p><span>\"Then just wait for a little bit. I\'ve just finished cooking,\" Seol-Ah said. She returned to the kitchen and brought out a pot. \"It\'s kimchi stew. I wanted to treat you to something better, but… I\'m sorry.\"</span></p><p><span>While making an apologetic expression, she put the pot on the table and opened the lid. White steam rose out of the pot, and a mouthwatering aroma emerged.</span></p><p><span>\"…!\" Kang-Woo\'s eyes widened as a shiver ran through his body. \"Kimchi… stew…\"</span></p><p><span>His eyes trembled while looking at the kimchi stew on the table. The hot stew with red kimchi and slices of pork belly drew him in.</span></p><p><span>\"Kimchi stew!!!\" he exclaimed excitedly.</span></p><p><em><span>Thump!</span></em></p><p><span>How long had Kang-Woo been waiting for this moment? He had dreamed about it almost every day in his sleep.</span></p><p><span>Kang-woo rushed to the table like someone who had starved for many days.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I\'m glad I returned.\'</span></em></p><p><span>A warm tear ran down his cheek.</span></p></div><div><span></span></div><!--$--><!--/$-->'),(6,1,'Chapter 6 - Demon King\'s Rage (1)',_binary '<div style=\"font-size:16px;color:#E0E0E0;font-family:Open Sans;line-height:24px\" prose=\"xl\" class=\"fr-view prose max-w-none dark:prose-invert relative dark:text-white mb-[97px] sm:mb-[50px] ww-uajudi\"><p><em><span>Slurp!

Munch, munch!</span></em></p><p><span>However, Kang-Woo didn\'t seem to care that Seol-Ah was watching him. He was just focused on eating.</span></p><p><em><span>\'It\'s delicious.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo took a spoonful of rice, put a slice of pork belly on top of it, and then placed a slice of kimchi on top of that. He opened his mouth wide and put the heaping spoon into his mouth. A new world of sensations spread through his body.</span></p><p><em><span>\'This is too delicious!!!\'</span></em></p><p><span>His taste buds, which had been lying around without doing anything for ten millennia, were going crazy.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo\'s feelings now were similar to when he had met Han Seol-Ah for the first time. His mind went blank.</span></p><p><span>\"</span><em><span>Sniff…</span></em><span>\" He was overwhelmed by emotion.</span></p><p><span>Memories of his ten millennia of suffering flashed through his mind.</span></p><p><span>\"</span><em><span>Sniff…</span></em><span> </span><em><span>Hic.</span></em><span> Fuck… This is too delicious.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo ate the kimchi stew while crying like a little kid.</span></p><p><span>After he accepted demonic energy into his body in the Nine Hells, he had practically become half-demon and thus no longer needed to consume food to live. Demons maintained and moved their bodies through demonic energy, so they didn\'t need to eat.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Those poor guys.\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>Kang-Woo pitied the demons who didn\'t know about the pleasure one could get from eating food.</span></p><p><span>Although he did not need to eat, Kang-Woo\'s taste buds were still intact because part of his body was still human. Demons, on the other hand, had weak taste buds to begin with because their bodies didn\'t require sustenance in the form of food.</span></p><p><span>\"I-Is it that delicious?\" Seol-Ah stuttered while watching Kang-Woo eat the kimchi stew while crying.</span></p><p><span>She was confident in her cooking skills, as she had done most of the housework ever since she was little. So, the kimchi stew she had cooked was the result of the skills and experience she had accumulated throughout the years. However… Seol-Ah didn\'t think her food was good enough to cause a person to shed tears while eating it.</span></p><p><span>\"It\'s… too delicious…\" Kang-Woo nodded while emptying the kimchi stew.</span></p><p><span>\"I\'m glad that you like it.\" Seol-Ah smiled proudly.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, she still found his reaction awkward since he wasn\'t like those people in charge of making reactions in cooking manhwas. Despite that, she didn\'t hate it. Kang-Woo\'s reaction just meant that he really liked what she had cooked for him.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I\'m glad,\'</span></em><span> Seol-Ah thought.</span></p><p><span>She had felt a bit guilty because the only thing she could offer to the person who had saved her life was kimchi stew, but seeing how much he enjoyed eating it made her feel relieved.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo seemed to have a pure side, which made her more interested in him.</span></p><p><em><span>\'What am I thinking?\'</span></em></p><p><span>Seol-Ah didn\'t have time to think about relationships. She sighed while thinking of her current situation.</span></p><p><em><span>Clatter!</span></em></p><p><span>\"Ah…\" Kang-Woo let out a sad gasp after seeing the empty pot.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I haven\'t had enough yet,\'</span></em><span> he lamented inwardly.</span></p><p><span>He had a body that didn\'t require food, but his taste buds, which had activated after ten millennia of dormancy, weren\'t satisfied.</span></p><p><span>\"Should I make a bit more?\" Seol-Ah asked.</span></p><p><span>\"Yes!\"</span></p><p><span>\"Fufu. Then wait a moment, please.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo nodded without a moment of hesitation.</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah took the empty pot and stood up from her seat with a smile. Perhaps it was because she found Kang-Woo\'s behavior cute.</span></p><p><span>\"It\'s nice to see a young man who eats well,\" Seol-Ah\'s mother remarked.</span></p><p><span>\"It\'s the most delicious kimchi stew I have ever eaten,\" Kang-Woo stated.</span></p><p><span>He wasn\'t exaggerating. The kimchi stew had tasted so good that it was as if Seol-Ah had put all kinds of drugs inside it.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I cannot lose this.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo couldn\'t let that kimchi stew go.</span></p><p><em><span>\'The answer is marriage.\'</span></em></p><p><span>In truth, the reason why it tasted so good to him was because he hadn\'t eaten proper food for the past ten millennia. Nonetheless, he didn\'t have the rationality to come to that conclusion at the moment.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo\'s eyes shone as he imagined his future with her, full of her kimchi stew.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Darling, I\'m going to make you happy!\'</span></em></p><p><span>The lord of the Nine Hells, a gluttonous monster who had devoured more than hundreds of thousands of demons… This scene of the demon king, who had been at the top of the food chain in the Nine Hells, losing his reason because of a kimchi stew felt like a tragedy.</span></p><p><em><span>Bubble bubble.</span></em></p><p><span>\"Since you enjoyed it so much earlier, I\'ve made more this time,\" Seol-Ah said.</span></p><p><span>She knew nothing about Kang-Woo, who had eaten all the stew, yet she smiled and brought out another bubbling pot of kimchi stew.</span></p><p><span>\"Thanks for the meal!\" Kang-Woo told her.</span></p><p><em><span>Slurp! Munch!</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo grabbed the spoon and once again began emptying the pot of kimchi stew.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Like I thought, it\'s still delicious!\'</span></em><span> he thought, once again moved by the taste of the stew on his tongue.</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah smiled proudly while looking at how eagerly he was eating the kimchi stew.</span></p><p><em><span>Boom!</span></em></p><p><span>The door suddenly slammed open, and a young man entered the house.</span></p><p><span>\"Hey, Seol-Ah! I heard that you entered a Gate without my permission! Come here!\" he yelled.</span></p><p><span>The young man, who was dressed in a suit, had short blond hair and fine facial features. He approached Seol-Ah while letting out a slew of curses.</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah froze upon seeing him.</span></p><p><span>\"O-Oppa…\"</span></p><p><span>\"Tae-Hyun! H-How can you talk to Seol-Ah like that?!\"</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah and her mother trembled because of Han Tae-Hyun\'s sudden appearance in the apartment.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun snorted indifferently and walked over to Seol-Ah.</span></p><p><span>He questioned, \"Who gave you permission to enter a Gate by yourself?\"</span></p><p><span>\"I-I\'m a Player now. Also, it was you who stopped me from getting a party!\" Seol-Ah replied.</span></p><p><span>\"Hmph, you talk too much nonsense for a newbie who hasn\'t even received basic training,\" Tae-Hyun said. Then he grabbed Seol-Ah\'s shoulders while smiling. With eyes of ambition, he whispered to Seol-Ah, \"I told you to stop this nonsense and join our guild. I\'ll introduce you to some kind people.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Ugh…\" Seol-Ah looked at Tae-Hyun with a disgusted expression.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun was Seol-Ah\'s biological older brother, and he was three years older than her.</span></p><p><em><span>\'This human garbage isn\'t my brother.\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>Seol-Ah clenched her fists and glared at him.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun had been a troublemaker even before the Gates had appeared five years ago.</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah and Tae-Hyun\'s father had died at a young age, but their household circumstances hadn\'t been that bad despite their mother raising them by herself. Their mother had been a skillful career woman, so she had earned a decent amount of money.</span></p><p><span>However, ever since middle school, Tae-Hyun had been involved in many acts of violence. He even assaulted his mother and robbed her of the valuables she had at home. After that, her mother fell sick from all the stress Tae-Hyun\'s behavior caused her, and that made their household situation worsen.</span></p><p><span>On top of that, Tae-Hyun had awakened as a Player. He was a very talented Player. When he reached Level 10 and achieved his Second Awakening, he received a B-rank Trait and joined the Andras Guild.</span></p><p><span>The Andras Guild was a guild whose name was based on one of the seventy-two demons of Solomon, and just like their name, they were famous for doing all sorts of horrible things.</span></p><p><span>After entering the Andras Guild, Tae-Hyun did everything he could to reach a higher position. The Andras Guild wasn\'t big, but it was still quite large compared to mid-sized guilds.</span></p><p><span>In such a large guild, Tae-Hyun\'s abilities were only considered average, so he was struggling to climb up. That\'s when he thought of Seol-Ah, his beautiful little sister.</span></p><p><em><span>\'If I put her in the same party as my superiors…\'</span></em></p><p><span>There weren\'t many women that were as pretty as Seol-Ah. If she were offered to them, he would probably be able to reach a higher position. Tae-Hyun was a lowlife who didn\'t feel remorse for wanting to sacrifice his family member for personal gain.</span></p><p><span>\"No. I\'ll never join your guild,\" Seol-Ah declared.</span></p><p><span>\"Hah. It seems like you\'re still far too naive to understand how the world works. This isn\'t a world you can live in just by doing things you like. If you receive the love of my superiors, your life will improve immediately, and so will mine.\"</span></p><p><span>\"How… How can you say something like that to your family?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Huh? Family? Don\'t bullshit me. How could I call such a poor and useless bunch like this my family?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Whose fault do you think that is?!\"</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun laughed at Seol-Ah\'s shout and then said, \"Whose fault? It\'s obviously because of Dad, who died too early, and Mom, who can only earn pennies.\"</span></p><p><span>\"You crazy bastard!\"</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah couldn\'t contain her anger anymore. She clenched her fists and tried to punch him.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun wasn\'t her family member anymore; he was just a beast wearing the skin of a human. No, he was trash.</span></p><p><em><span>Grab!</span></em></p><p><span>\"Ugh!!\" Seol-Ah groaned in pain when Tae-Hyun grabbed Seol-Ah\'s wrist.</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah shook because of the pain in her wrist. She had just reached Level 6, so overpowering Tae-Hyun, who was very close to Level 30, was impossible for her.</span></p><p><span>\"Let me go!\" she screamed.</span></p><p><span>\"The only thing useful about you is your pretty face. So, you should think of using that to at least be of some help. Don\'t you think so? How could you talk to your older brother like that? You spoiled little—\"</span></p><p><span>\"T-Tae-Hyun!\" the siblings\' mother called out.</span></p><p><span>\"Get out of the way, you old hag!\" Tae-Hyun spat.</span></p><p><span>He ignored his mother, who stood in his way, and walked toward the living room while holding Seol-Ah\'s wrist.</span></p><p><span>\"Today, I will make sure to… Huh?\"</span></p><p><em><span>Slurp! Munch!</span></em></p><p><span>The moment he entered the living room, he saw Kang-Woo, who was concentrating on eating the kimchi stew.</span></p><p><span>\"What, did you seduce some man?\" Tae-Hyun said while laughing at Seol-Ah.</span></p><p><span>He let go of her wrist, walked toward Kang-Woo, and said, \"Hey, man. You\'re a bother, so get the fuck out.\"</span></p><p><em><span>Slurp!</span></em></p><p><span>Even though Tae-Hyun had threatened him, Kang-Woo just ignored Tae-Hyun and kept eating the kimchi stew.</span></p><p><span>\"I told you to get the fuck out!\" Tae-Hyun repeated.</span></p><p><span>However, Kang-Woo continued ignoring him, so Tae-Hyun violently kicked the table.</span></p><p><em><span>Slam!</span></em></p><p><span>The table was overturned, and…</span></p><p><span>\"Ah…\" Kang-Woo gasped.</span></p><p><span>The kimchi stew… was spilled… on the floor…</span></p><p><span>\"AAAHHH!\"</span></p><p><span>The lord of the Nine Hells, the monster that had devoured the seven princes of Hell who used to rule Hell… He was the demon of demons, the predator of predators, and an existence that was like the Hell of the Hells. He was the master of demons who had devoured more than a hundred thousand demons.</span></p><p><span>The scream from the demon king, the pinnacle of all demons, spread through the worn-down apartment.</span></p><p><span>\"MY KIMCHI STEEWWW!!!\"</span></p></div><div><span></span></div><!--$--><!--/$-->'),(7,1,'Chapter 7 - Demon King\'s Rage (2)',_binary '<div style=\"font-size:16px;color:#E0E0E0;font-family:Open Sans;line-height:24px\" prose=\"xl\" class=\"fr-view prose max-w-none dark:prose-invert relative dark:text-white mb-[97px] sm:mb-[50px] ww-uajudi\"><p><em><span>\'What\'s up with this bastard?\'</span></em><span> Han Tae-Hyun wondered inwardly.</span></p><p><span>He laughed at Oh Kang-Woo, who was crying out because of the spilled kimchi stew.</span></p><p><span>\"Is he crazy?\" Tae-Hyun said.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun thought that his unnecessarily kind sister had invited a beggar to the house.</span></p><p><span>\"Where did you find a hobo like this?\" he asked.</span></p><p><span>\"R-Run, Kang-Woo!\" Han Seol-Ah shouted while ignoring Tae-Hyun\'s question.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun was a summoner who was almost at Level 30 and about to achieve his Fourth Awakening. At almost Level 30, he was by no means considered a high-level summoner. However, he was extremely strong compared to the current Seol-Ah, and she didn\'t want to see her brother hurt the person who had saved her.</span></p><p><span>For a moment, Seol-Ah thought that maybe Kang-Woo could resolve the situation, but she then shook her head.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Oppa unlocked a B-rank Trait in his Second Awakening.\'</span></em></p><p><span>It was a Trait that people usually unlocked in either the Third or Fourth Awakening. The strength of a Player was determined by the rank of their Traits and level. Because of that, Tae-Hyun was considered more talented than normal people.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Kang-Woo is in danger.\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>Seol-Ah looked at Kang-Woo frantically.</span></p><p><span>\"</span><em><span>Sniff, sniff.</span></em><span> My k-kimchi steeew…\" Kang-Woo lamented.</span></p><p><span>He was seemingly unaware of how much Seol-Ah was worrying about him and just cried while gazing at the spilled kimchi stew.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun frowned at the sight. \"Hey, hobo. Stop crying, and stand up.\"</span></p><p><span>\"…\" Kang-Woo slowly turned his head toward Tae-Hyun, who had called on him rudely, and emitted a strong bloodlust.</span></p><p><span>\"Ugh?!\" Tae-Hyun backed off unconsciously the moment his eyes met Kang-Woo\'s.</span></p><p><em><span>\'What?\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>Tae-Hyun was shocked.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo\'s eyes weren\'t the eyes of a human. He had a ferocious gaze similar to that of a wild beast or maybe a reptile.</span></p><p><em><span>\'No.\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>Tae-Hyun\'s face turned pale.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo wasn\'t anything like a wild beast or reptile. His bloodlust was thicker and more frightening than that of a wild beast.</span></p><p><span>Fear spread through Tae-Hyun\'s body as if he were looking into an abyss.</span></p><p><em><span>\'He\'s like a…\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>Tae-Hyun searched for a word that matched those murderous eyes.</span></p><p><span>He didn\'t have to think for long.</span></p><p><span>\"Demon…\" Tae-Hyun muttered.</span></p><p><span>He had never seen a demon in real life, nor did he know a lot about them, but he somehow thought there was probably no better word to describe Kang-Woo than \'demon.\'</span></p><p><span>\"</span><em><span>Huff, huff.</span></em><span>\"</span></p><p><em><span>Whir.</span></em></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun panted as he gathered his mana. The thick bloodlust that had overwhelmed him gradually disappeared.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I must have been mistaken.\'</span></em></p><p><span>He glared at Kang-Woo. There was no way that hobo would be capable of emitting bloodlust that could overwhelm him.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun shook his head to erase the bloodlust he\'d just felt from his memories. He didn\'t want to admit that he had shaken in fear of a hobo who cried because his kimchi stew spilled onto the ground.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo, who was silently glaring at Tae-Hyun, spoke in a low voice, \"Are you the one?\"</span></p><p><span>\"… What?\"</span></p><p><span>\"The one who dared to spill my kimchi stew?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Hah, have you lost your mind, hobo?\" Tae-Hyun smiled and focused his mana on his fists.</span></p><p><span>He activated Flaming Touch, the Second Awakening Trait he had unlocked when he reached Level 10.</span></p><p><em><span>Fwoosh!</span></em></p><p><span>Blue flames enveloped his fists. The flames were so intense that it seemed like they were about to burn down the entire apartment.</span></p><p><span>Players had the unique ability to use the power of the Trait that they had unlocked as a Trait skill. This power was what allowed Players to fight back against the monsters that were flooding into Earth from the Gates.</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah extended her hands while shouting, \"Be careful!\"</span></p><p><span>Then she shot an arrow made of light at Tae-Hyun\'s head.</span></p><p><span>The Trait she had obtained after awakening as a Player was Trace of Light, a D-rank Trait. It wasn\'t an offensive Trait; it was more focused on buffs and healing.</span></p><p><span>\"Hmph,\" Tae-Hyun scoffed.</span></p><p><em><span>Paf!&nbsp;</span></em><span>He easily obliterated the arrow with just a light swing of his hand.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun wasn\'t so weak as to lose to a low-level Player who hadn\'t awakened an offensive Trait.</span></p><p><span>\"Haap!\" Tae-Hyun uttered.</span></p><p><span>Right after, he charged forth and fired the blue flames enveloping his hands at Kang-Woo.</span></p><p><em><span>Swoosh!</span></em></p><p><span>\"Huh?\" Kang-Woo merely tilted his head a bit and dodged the flames.</span></p><p><span>Then a black blade extended from the back of his left hand. Kang-Woo bent down and easily dodged Tae-Hyun\'s next attack aimed at his head, following up with a swing of his blade.</span></p><p><span>\"Ugh!\" Tae-Hyun groaned as he twisted his body forcefully to avoid the attack.</span></p><p><em><span>\'He\'s not fast,\'</span></em><span> Tae-Hyun thought.</span></p><p><span>Although he could feel menacing energy coming from the blade, it wasn\'t moving swiftly. So, Tae-Hyun moved while focusing his attention solely on the blade.</span></p><p><em><span>Slam!</span></em></p><p><span>\"Kurgh!\" Tae-Hyun let out yet another groan.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo\'s foot had struck Tae-Hyun\'s solar plexus. The black blade had been bait right from the very beginning—a fake to place Tae-Hyun\'s attention somewhere else.</span></p><p><span>\"Son of a bitch!\" Tae-Hyun yelled.</span></p><p><span>He didn\'t receive a great amount of damage, but he cursed while swinging his fists.</span></p><p><span>Once again, Kang-Woo dodged Tae-Hyun\'s attack with minimal movements. After that, he punched Tae-Hyun twice in the face.</span></p><p><em><span>Whack! Paf!</span></em></p><p><span>\"Kurgh! Urgh!\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo bent toward the staggering Tae-Hyun and swung his left hand. Seeing that, Tae-Hyun quickly moved his blue-flame-covered arms toward Kang-Woo\'s left hand.</span></p><p><em><span>Slam!</span></em></p><p><span>\"</span><em><span>Cough!</span></em><span>\"</span></p><p><em><span>Boom!</span></em></p><p><span>However, Kang-Woo seemed to have expected that. He immediately pulled his left hand back and slammed an uppercut with his right fist into Tae-Hyun, sending him tumbling to the ground.</span></p><p><span>\"</span><em><span>Huff, huff.</span></em><span>\" Tae-Hyun looked up at Kang-Woo with a pale look on his face.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun was stronger and faster, which meant that Kang-Woo had a lower level and stats than him.</span></p><p><span>Yet…</span></p><p><em><span>\'Just who the hell is this bastard?\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo\'s fighting style was something Tae-Hyun had never even imagined. Most people would use their main weapon to attack, but Kang-Woo had used it as a fake and used that momentary gap in Tae-Hyun\'s defense to counter. It was as if a swordsman had used his sword as bait and engaged in hand-to-hand combat.</span></p><p><span>\"Aaarrgh!\" Tae-Hyun roared in a fit of rage and leaped toward Kang-Woo.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, the result was the same. Kang-Woo completely overwhelmed Tae-Hyun as if he were fighting against a child.</span></p><p><em><span>Paf!</span></em></p><p><span>\"</span><em><span>Cough!</span></em><span> Wh-What the hell are you?!\" Tae-Hyun exclaimed.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo had no openings. Tae-Hyun could feel the overwhelming difference in battle experience between them. Was this what it would feel like fighting against a warrior who had fought on the battlefield for decades?</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun was being beaten up by a hobo who had been crying over kimchi stew.</span></p><p><em><span>Smash!</span></em></p><p><span>\"Aaarrgh!\" Tae-Hyun yelped.</span></p><p><span>The black blade pierced his left wrist.</span></p><p><span>\"I-It hurts!!! It hurts!!!\" he yelled.</span></p><p><span>\"It isn\'t over yet,\" Kang-Woo stated coldly.</span></p><p><span>He twisted the black blade.</span></p><p><em><span>Crunch.</span></em></p><p><span>The chilling sound of Tae-Hyun\'s wrist bones being broken rang out.</span></p><p><span>\"AAARRGGHH!\" Tae-Hyun screamed.</span></p><p><span>He thrashed around like a fish out of water as the pain spread through his body.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo used his black blade to stab Tae-Hyun\'s right wrist next. The rage of the demon king wouldn\'t be appeased with the crippling of just one hand.</span></p><p><span>\"There\'s still a long way to go before you pay the price for spilling my kimchi stew,\" Kang-Woo said.</span></p><p><span>\"Wh-Why are you doing this?! It\'s just kimchi stew!\" Tae-Hyun shouted.</span></p><p><span>\"…\" Kang-Woo froze upon hearing that. \"What… did you say?\"</span></p><p><span>He looked at Tae-Hyun as if he had said something outrageous.</span></p><p><span>\"Did you say… it\'s just… kimchi stew?\" Kang-Woo questioned.</span></p><p><span>He couldn\'t believe Tae-Hyun had said something so outrageous. That was something that should never be said. The mention of \'kimchi stew\' did not go together with the word \'just.\' Kimchi stew was much more sacred than that.</span></p><p><span>\"Just! Kimchi stew?!\" Kang-Woo raged.</span></p><p><em><span>Paf! Pow!</span></em></p><p><span>\"</span><em><span>Cough!</span></em><span> Kurgh! Ahh! S-Spare me!!\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo\'s assault on Tae-Hyun became more aggressive. He kicked Tae-Hyun\'s head as if it were a football, instantly covering Tae-Hyun\'s face in blood.</span></p><p><span>\"</span><em><span>Cough!</span></em><span> Ugh!\" Tae-Hyun let out a painful groan.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun\'s stats were higher than Kang-Woo\'s, yet he couldn\'t help but suffer in pain in this one-sided fight. Mind-numbing pain spread through his body.</span></p><p><span>\"</span><em><span>Huff, huff…</span></em><span> Now, say that again. What did you say about kimchi stew?\"</span></p><p><span>\"</span><em><span>Cough…&nbsp;</span></em><span>K-Kimchi stew is… a sacred f-food…\"</span></p><p><span>\"Good,\" Kang-Woo said.</span></p><p><span>He seemed to like that answer, and he nodded with a smile.</span></p><p><span>Then he grabbed the hair of the terrified Tae-Hyun and spoke in a low voice, \"Now, if you understand, say it one more time. Kimchi stew is what?\"</span></p><p><span>\"A… s-sacred existence,\" Tae-Hyun said while trembling.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo frowned. It seemed that he didn\'t like how Tae-Hyun had said it.</span></p><p><span>\"Your voice is too low,\" Kang-Woo admonished.</span></p><p><span>\"K-Kimchi stew is a sacred existence!\"</span></p><p><span>\"You\'re not putting enough heart into it!\"</span></p><p><span>\"Kimchi stew!

Shout it with more heart!\"</span></p><p><span>\"KIMCHI STEW!!! IS A SACRED EXISTEEEEEEEEENCE!!!\"</span></p><p><span>It was a scream that was closer to a cry, yet it still didn\'t have the tone Kang-Woo wanted.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo shouted while shaking his head, \"That\'s not it! It\'s still lacking!! Turn it up seven notches!!\"</span></p><p><span>\"Kimchi st—!! Kurgh! </span><em><span>Cough!

However, the guy who had just beaten him up was more of a villain than a hero.</span></p><p><em><span>\'The kimchi stew villain…\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>Tae-Hyun looked at Oh Kang-Woo with eyes full of resentment.</span></p><p><span>Upon catching a glimpse of that resentful gaze, Kang-Woo laughed. \"What? Do I look like a lunatic to you because I\'m so obsessed with kimchi stew?\"</span></p><p><span>\"N-No, not at all!\" Tae-Hyun quickly shook his head.</span></p><p><span>With deep and sunken eyes, Kang-Woo continued, \"You… have absolutely no idea.\"</span></p><p><span>There was no way Tae-Hyun would know what sorts of feelings and thoughts Kang-Woo had had during the past ten millennia.</span></p><p><span>Demons did not have a lifespan; they could live forever without eating or drinking. After Kang-Woo acquired demonic energy, he had basically become a half-demon, and just like the demons, the concept of a lifespan had vanished for him.</span></p><p><span>Despite that… he still had a human side left. His mind and bodily senses still remembered the pleasures of eating and drinking. Yet, the things that he craved didn\'t exist at all in the Nine Hells. That was because the demons didn\'t need what he was craving.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, it was impossible for him to give up on his desires. A demon\'s body was built in a way that prevented their mind from breaking down and, in turn, made it impossible for them to give up their desires. This was why Kang-Woo had managed to remain sane while living for more than ten millennia, and it was also why demons fought endlessly for all eternity.</span></p><p><span>Living the life of a demon while being human was like being tortured for all eternity. Kang-Woo\'s desires couldn\'t be fulfilled, nor could his thirst be quenched.</span></p><p><span>The reason why Hell truly felt like Hell to him wasn\'t because of the eternally burning flames or the desolate land. It was because there was truly nothing there that he desired.</span></p><p><span>\"You just don\'t understand how wonderful your life is,\" Kang-Woo stated.</span></p><p><span>It was the same as people not realizing how thankful they should be for the air. Although humans would die in a few seconds without air, no one was thankful for it each time they breathed. A person only craved normal things when they ceased to be normal.</span></p><p><span>\"Ugh. I… I\'m sorry! I was wrong!\"</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun couldn\'t understand the meaning behind his words, but there was nothing he could do now except ask for forgiveness.</span></p><p><span>\"Okay, I\'ll forgive you,\" Kang-Woo said and grabbed Tae-Hyun by the collar.</span></p><p><span>\"Eek! P-Please don\'t kill me!\"</span></p><p><span>\"Don\'t worry. I won\'t kill you.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo wasn\'t letting Tae-Hyun live out of sympathy or because he hated the idea of murdering someone.</span></p><p><span>There was only one reason why he wasn\'t killing Tae-Hyun.</span></p><p><em><span>\'It\'d be bothersome.\'</span></em></p><p><span>If this were Hell, things would be different, but on Earth, killing another person was a crime. Of course, letting Tae-Hyun off could create trouble for him in the future, so Kang-Woo thought of something better.</span></p><p><span>\"Th-Thank you!\" Tae-Hyun bowed with hopeful eyes after hearing that Kang-Woo wasn\'t going to kill him.</span></p><p><span>However, Kang-Woo smirked while looking at Tae-Hyun. \"Dying would\'ve been better for you.\"</span></p><p><span>\"…?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Well, you\'ll find out soon.\"</span></p><p><span>After saying that, Kang-Woo\'s demonic energy began pouring out as he activated the Authority of Fear, Orobas\'s Authority. It engraved the target\'s fear on their soul, turning them into a puppet that couldn\'t even fathom the idea of going against the caster. It wasn\'t an Authority that consumed a lot of demonic energy, but it had rather harsh prerequisites.</span></p><p><em><span>\'It\'s hard to produce an extreme state of fear in someone.\'</span></em></p><p><span>It was difficult to inflict enough fear on someone to engrave it on their soul, so it was impossible to use the Authority unless the difference in power with the opponent was made clear, like in the current situation. However, if the Authority of Fear could be used, it worked like a charm.</span></p><p><span>\"Ah, aah…\" Tae-Hyun uttered.</span></p><p><span>The Authority of Fear amplified the fear that Tae-Hyun was feeling. He peed his pants and looked at Kang-Woo blankly.</span></p><p><span>\"You\'ll have to live forever while feeling these emotions.\" Kang-Woo smiled as he watched Tae-Hyun tremble.</span></p><p><span>\"N-No…\" Tae-Hyun said while squeezing out what was left of his rationality.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo shrugged and replied in a light tone, \"This isn\'t a world you can live in just by doing things you like.\"</span></p><p><span>The words that Tae-Hyun had said to Han Seol-Ah earlier had turned into a sharp arrow that was shot back at him.</span></p><p><span>\"You can go now. And don\'t tell anyone about what happened here.\" Kang-Woo waved his hand in irritation to shoo Tae-Hyun away.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun had become Kang-Woo\'s puppet. Even if Tae-Hyun were tortured, he likely wouldn\'t be able to say anything about what had happened here.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Hyun just stood up blankly and staggered out.</span></p><p><span>After seeing Tae-Hyun leave, Seol-Ah walked toward Kang-Woo and bowed to him.</span></p><p><span>She said, \"Thank you. If it weren\'t for you… I wouldn\'t have been able to stop him.\"</span></p><p><span>Not only had Kang-Woo saved Seol-Ah from the Goblins, but he had also saved her and her mother from Tae-Hyun, who had been bothering them for many years. Consequently, Seol-Ah wasn\'t sure about how to repay Kang-Woo. Simply saying thanks wasn\'t anywhere near enough.</span></p><p><span>\"I\'ll try my best… to repay your generosity,\" she said sincerely while bowing.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo gazed at her with a smile. \"First, let\'s clean this place up.\"</span></p><p><span>The apartment had become a mess because of Kang-Woo and Tae-Hyun\'s fight.</span></p><p><span>\"Oh, I can do it myself…\"</span></p><p><span>\"It\'ll be faster if we do it together.\"</span></p><p><span>Then Kang-Woo began cleaning the apartment with Seol-Ah.</span></p><p><span>While they were cleaning, she carefully asked him, \"Come to think of it, where do you live, Kang-Woo?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Ah,\" a brief utterance emerged from Kang-Woo\'s mouth at her sudden question.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Now that I think about it, the place where I used to live is probably gone.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo hadn\'t paid rent for five years, so there was probably another person living in what used to be his home. It was then that he realized that he had no place to sleep.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I\'ll have to find a place to live first.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Nevertheless, Kang-Woo wasn\'t that worried. He now had power that made him incomparable to his past human self, so it shouldn\'t be hard for him to get a place to live.</span></p><p><span>\"Because of certain circumstances, I don\'t have a place to stay at the moment,\" Kang-Woo answered.</span></p><p><span>\"Does that mean…?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Well, I\'m homeless for the moment,\" Kang-Woo replied with a shrug.</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah thought about it for a moment.</span></p><p><span>\"In that case…\" Seol-Ah began while blushing slightly. She clenched her fists and asked nervously, \"W-Would you like to live here until you find a place to live?\"</span></p><p><span>The truth was that what she was doing was irrational. Although she was indebted to Kang-Woo, there was no way that a rational woman would offer such a thing to a man whom she had only met a few hours ago.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I know that, but…\'</span></em><span> Seol-Ah wanted to know more about the man named Oh Kang-Woo.</span></p><p><span>She wanted to know who he was and what kind of life he had lived until now. To put it bluntly, she was kind of interested in him.</span></p><p><span>\"Oh.\" Kang-Woo\'s eyes lit up.</span></p><p><span>It turned out that he didn\'t even need to think about finding a place to stay. There probably wasn\'t a better place than here for him to stay and get used to life on Earth. Kang-Woo wouldn\'t be able to live comfortably because of Seol-Ah\'s financial situation, but that really didn\'t matter to him.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I can earn money myself,\'</span></em><span> he thought.</span></p><p><span>If power was the most important thing in Hell, then money was the most important thing on Earth. In a capitalist society, money was an entity similar to a god.</span></p><p><span>\"Okay. Then I\'ll be in your care for a little bit,\" Kang-Woo said.</span></p><p><span>\"Ah,\" Seol-Ah uttered.</span></p><p><span>Her anxious face reddened in embarrassment. She knew that her behavior was abnormal.</span></p><p><span>\"I\'ll be in your care, Seol-Ah.\"</span></p><p><span>\"L-Likewise!\" Seol-Ah said. She bowed while shaking hands with Kang-Woo. Then she added, \"You can use my brother\'s old room.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Okay,\" Kang-Woo replied with a nod.</span></p><p><span>After that, Seol-Ah brought him to her brother\'s room.</span></p><p><em><span>\'First, I need to take care of two things,\'</span></em><span> Kang-Woo thought.</span></p><p><span>He needed to raise his demonic energy so that he could use it in place of his sealed Ten Thousand Demon Core and earn some money for his daily expenses. Among the hundreds of Authorities he possessed, many were useful even outside of battle. If he wanted to live comfortably from now on, then he had to be able to use all of them freely. However, to do that, he needed to increase the amount of demonic energy he had access to.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I might get involved with more guys like Tae-Hyun down the road.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo had won easily against Tae-Hyun, despite his stats being absurdly lower than Tae-Hyun\'s. However, that was because Tae-Hyun\'s combat prowess was horribly bad. If Kang-Woo\'s opponent were someone of a higher level and with better technique than Tae-Hyun, Kang-Woo would have trouble fighting against them because his Ten Thousand Demon Core was sealed. So, Kang-Woo\'s number one priority at the moment was increasing his demonic energy.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Also, money.\'</span></em></p><p><span>He\'d learned from the internet that Players earned money by hunting monsters.</span></p><p><span>\"Seol-Ah, do you have a mana stone with you?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Oh, yes. I don\'t have that many, but I have a few E-rank ones.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Could I take a look at them?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Of course.\" Seol-Ah nodded and took out a mana stone, which was emitting white light, from her bag.</span></p><p><span>While looking at it, Kang-Woo remembered something that had been written in an online article. </span><em><span>\'They said that the closer it is to black, the higher rank it has.\'</span></em></p><p><span>It was the same with Gates. The lowest rank that a Gate could have was F, and they were white. The higher a Gate\'s rank was, the more murky its color became, peaking with black.</span></p><p><span>The more highly ranked a mana stone was, the higher the amount of mana would be contained inside, and thus, you could sell it for a higher price. Most players earned an income by selling the mana stones they obtained by hunting.</span></p><p><span>After taking the E-rank mana stone from Seol-Ah and placing it in his hand, Kang-Woo closed his eyes. He focused his attention on the energy inside the mana stone.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I can\'t feel any demonic energy inside.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo remembered when he\'d used the Authority of Predation on the Goblins\' corpses. The corpses had contained demonic energy, although it was only a very small amount. Consequently, Kang-Woo thought that there would be demonic energy inside the mana stones too, which were considered to be the monsters\' core.</span></p><p><span>Nonetheless, that did not seem to be the case. The energy inside the mana stone wasn\'t demonic energy but mana.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Then… where is the demonic energy stored?\'</span></em></p><p><span>He hadn\'t checked for that when he used the Authority of Predation on the corpses because he had not even considered the possibility that the monsters would have demonic energy.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I\'ll also have to confirm that.\'</span></em></p><p><span>However, the most important thing wasn\'t figuring out where the monsters stored demonic energy. What mattered was that they had demonic energy and mana stones, which could be sold for a profit.</span></p><p><span>Just by hunting, Kang-Woo could achieve his two goals.</span></p><p><span>\"Seol-Ah, is there a Player Management Office near here?\"</span></p><p><span>\"No. We\'re on the outskirts of Seoul, so you\'ll have to go further into the city.\"</span></p><p><span>\"I see. Would you mind taking me there?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Sure. I was also planning on going,\" Seol-Ah answered while nodding.</span></p><p><span>\"You too?\"</span></p><p><span>\"Yes. After today\'s incident, I realized how hasty I was. Although it may take some time… I\'m going to enter a Gate after receiving basic training.\"</span></p><p><span>In Korea, there was a program in place that supported players and helped them level up safely until they reached Level 10 and unlocked their Second Awakening Trait.</span></p><p><span>The program was supposed to support new players, but it was way too expensive to take. That\'s why most Players from poor households like Seol-Ah could barely afford to take it.</span></p><p><span>In any case, she had realized from the day\'s incident that entering a Gate without her Second Awakening was like committing suicide.</span></p><p><span>\"Hmm.\" Kang-Woo\'s eyes narrowed at her words.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Should I help her?\'</span></em></p><p><span>With his strength, it shouldn\'t be hard for him to help Seol-Ah level up.</span></p><p><span>His level was lower than hers, but he had all the battle experience that he had gained throughout the last ten millennia, as well as all sorts of Authorities. Bringing someone along for his hunts wouldn\'t burden him.</span></p><p><em><span>\'No.\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>He shook his head after thinking about it for a moment. </span><em><span>\'The hunts won\'t be as efficient.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Maybe they could hunt together later on, but with Seol-Ah\'s current abilities, Kang-Woo had more to lose than gain.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I have no reason to have a party or use a strategy that hinders me.\'</span></em></p><p><span>It was true that he had taken a liking to Seol-Ah. She was the first human that he had met since returning to Earth. Furthermore, she was also the woman who had cooked him the food he\'d been craving for a long time. Still, that was no reason for Kang-Woo to suffer losses by taking her around with him.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I need to separate these things.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo was a calculating person. No, to be more precise, ten millennia in Hell had made him calculative. He used to be at the bottom of the food chain while in Hell. For someone who had been as weak as him to survive, he\'d had no other choice but to become calculative.</span></p><p><span>Of course, after time went on and he had devoured tons of demons with his Authority of Predation, Kang-Woo went up in the food chain. Nevertheless, the habits engraved in his soul didn\'t disappear.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I\'ll think about it after regaining my power.\'</span></em></p></div><div><span></span></div><!--$--><!--/$-->'),(9,1,'Chapter 9 - Demonic Energy Accumulation Project (1)',_binary '<div style=\"font-size:16px;color:#E0E0E0;font-family:Open Sans;line-height:24px\" prose=\"xl\" class=\"fr-view prose max-w-none dark:prose-invert relative dark:text-white mb-[97px] sm:mb-[50px] ww-uajudi\"><p><span>\"Here is your re-issued identification card.\"</span></p><p><span>\"…\"</span></p><p><span>Oh Kang-Woo was visiting the nearby district office before going to the Player Management Office.

Kang-Woo couldn\'t believe that they had built such a massive building in the middle of Seoul. It had probably cost a ridiculous amount of money to build.</span></p><p><em><span>\'This just shows how important Players have become for society, I guess.\'</span></em></p><p><span>The situation was understandable since Players were the ones protecting Earth from its demise.</span></p><p><span>\"Then I\'ll go and enroll in the basic training course. I think the first lesson is a theory one, so I will probably get home late,\" Seol-Ah said.</span></p><p><span>\"Then I\'ll see you at home.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Okay, Kang-Woo.\"</span></p><p><span>Seol-Ah waved goodbye to Kang-Woo and left to enroll in the basic training course.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, Kang-Woo walked toward the place in charge of registering new players. The process didn\'t take long.</span></p><p><span>After checking Kang-Woo\'s identification card a few times, the receptionist said in a robotic tone, \"Then please move to the test room.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Okay, thank you.\" Kang-Woo grabbed the ticket from the receptionist and turned around.</span></p><p><span>Many people were sitting excitedly in front of the test room.</span></p><p><span>\"Hello? Mom? Oh, I\'m in front of the test room. Yeah. I\'m gonna take the basic training course once I get the license. Hehe, just you wait. I\'ll make it big and get tons of offers from large guilds.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Excuse me, what rank Trait did you get on your First Awakening?\"</span></p><p><span>\"I got D-rank.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Whoa, that\'s pretty high. Maybe you\'ll get a B-rank one on your Second Awakening.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Haha, but that\'ll still be nothing compared to Players like Baek Kang-Hyun or Cha Yeon-Joo.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Come on. Those people apparently got S-rank Traits with their First Awakening.

I was so envious of him. I honestly don\'t expect to get such a rank with my First or Second Awakening, but if I could get one later on…\"</span></p><p><span>\"Then your life would take a 180-degree turn.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo sat down and silently eavesdropped on what other people were saying.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I guess Trait ranks truly are important.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Players unlocked a different Trait every ten levels. To them, Trait ranks practically decided the hierarchy, so the ranks of the Traits that a Player obtained at lower levels were especially important. The reason was that Players with low-rank Traits struggled to level up and were very unlikely to be able to have more Awakenings. The chances of getting a higher-ranked Trait increased as a Player achieved more Awakenings, but Players starting with low-rank Traits wouldn\'t even be able to get that chance.</span></p><p><span>\"Hmm…\" Kang-Woo opened his status window and checked the Trait he acquired with his First Awakening.</span></p><p><span>\"???-rank Trait. Huh?\"</span></p><p><span>The rank of his Trait, Authority of Predation, was unknown.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Is it because it\'s beyond the norm?\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo had a rough idea of why this might be the case. He didn\'t know how strong S, SS, or even SSS-rank Traits were, but he was sure they couldn\'t be compared to his Authority of Predation.</span></p><p><em><span>\'My Authority is seriously broken, after all.\'</span></em></p><p><span>The best part of the Authority of Predation was that it allowed him to grow indefinitely. Thanks to that, Kang-Woo had reached a point no demon could reach.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Although, I\'m not at that point anymore.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Nevertheless, he wasn\'t worried. His Authority of Predation had been sealed, but he still had ways of replenishing his demonic energy. Once he gathered more demonic energy, it should be possible for him to regain his old strength.</span></p><p><em><span>\'No, if I use the power of this Player thing or whatever it is…\'</span></em></p><p><span>He might even be able to surpass his old self.</span></p><p><span>\"Mr. Oh Kang-Woo.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Yes,\" Kang-Woo answered when his name was called.</span></p><p><span>Then he entered the test room. Inside the test room, there were many white testing orbs. Many nervous Players stood before the white orbs and placed their hands on top of them.</span></p><p><span>A woman wearing round glasses approached Kang-Woo and said, \"Please place your hand here. Once you activate your power, the color of the orb will change based on your Trait rank.\"</span></p><p><span>\"How does it change?\"</span></p><p><span>\"It\'s the same as Gates. The higher the rank, the darker the color will become.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo nodded at her words.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I wonder how it will be represented?\'</span></em></p><p><span>His Trait rank was outside the norm, so he was curious about what reaction the orb would show.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Well, I guess it doesn\'t matter.\'</span></em></p><p><span>After all, Kang-Woo wasn\'t the type to hide his strength to avoid receiving as little attention as possible. On the contrary, he was the type of person who stepped up when needed.</span></p><p><span>Without any hesitation, Kang-Woo placed his hand on the orb.</span></p><p><span>After checking that the color had barely changed, the woman stated with a dull voice while writing something, \"It\'s an F-rank Trait.\"</span></p><p><em><span>\'Huh?\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>Kang-Woo tilted his head at the unexpected result. </span><em><span>\'Is it because its power is mostly sealed?\'</span></em></p><p><span>There was no way for him to know. It was also possible that the power couldn\'t be measured because it was outside of the norm.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Well, it can\'t be helped.\'</span></em></p><p><span>There was no way to change the results.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo clicked his tongue. He would\'ve preferred it if they had brought a monster for him to fight against.</span></p><p><span>\"Players with a Trait lower than D-rank will receive an E-rank Player license. You can freely enter Gates of the same rank. As for Gates of higher rank, you\'ll need to apply for someone of higher rank to accompany you.\"</span></p><p><span>\"What can I do to increase my Player rank?\"</span></p><p><span>\"If you take the basic training course, you\'ll immediately be promoted to D-rank. Beyond that, you\'ll need to sell more than a designated quota of mana stones.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Okay.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Then, please wait at the counter. I\'ll get you your license immediately. Oh, if you would like to take the basic training course, you\'ll have to apply for it separately at the counter.\"</span></p><p><span>\"It\'s okay.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo had no intention of taking a basic training course. He could easily kill Goblins even with the insignificant amount of demonic energy that he currently had.</span></p><p><em><span>\'It\'s just a waste of time.\'</span></em></p><p><span>He had heard that they taught Players the basics they needed to know to fight, but that had no meaning to him. Kang-Woo had all the experience he had gained while fighting for ten millennia, so he did not intend to waste time and money by doing the basic education course.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo turned around and left the test room.</span></p><p><span>The woman with the round glasses sighed while watching Kang-Woo leave the test room.</span></p><p><em><span>\'He\'s absurdly untalented,\'</span></em><span> she remarked inwardly.</span></p><p><span>Almost no one got an F-rank Trait, even at their First Awakening. The average was E-rank or sometimes D-rank.</span></p><p><em><span>\'He\'s not even taking the basic training course.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Just getting an F-rank was awful, but if a Player didn\'t receive the basic training course as well, the outcome was obvious.</span></p><p><em><span>\'He\'s probably going to die as soon as he enters a Gate.\'</span></em></p><p><span>No party would accept a Player with an F-rank Trait into their party.</span></p><p><span>If that happened, most people would try to reach the Second or even Third Awakening by hunting alone and end up dying in the process.</span></p><p><span>The woman sighed. </span><em><span>\'He\'s better off not becoming a Player if he has an F-rank Trait.\'</span></em></p><p><span>It was sad living while doing a desk job in a world that could end at any time, but it was still better than being a Player with an F-rank Trait whose death was almost assured.</span></p><p><span>\"Hmm…?\"</span></p><p><span>At that moment, she saw something in the crystal orb that had been used to test Kang-Woo.</span></p><p><span>\"What\'s happening?\"</span></p><p><span>The crystal orb started to darken.</span></p><p><span>From white to light gray and then to a darker gray before finally becoming… pitch black.</span></p><p><span>\"Is it broken?\"</span></p><p><span>The woman had never seen an orb\'s color change by itself. She looked at the crystal orb with a confused expression on her face.</span></p><p><em><span>Crack!</span></em></p><p><span>The surface of the pitch-black crystal orb began breaking and eventually shattered into pieces.</span></p><p><span>\"Ugh… It\'s definitely broken.\"</span></p><p><span>As the woman gazed at the shattered crystal orb, she put on an expression that seemed to say \"as expected.\"</span></p><p><em><span>\'There\'s no way he could have gotten a black Trait rank.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Even Baek Kang-Hyun, who had gotten an S-rank with his First Awakening, had only managed to turn the orb into a slightly intense gray.</span></p><p><span>Yet, this wasn\'t gray but pitch black.

It seems like you must not have received basic training. Did you perhaps awaken an F-rank Trait? If so, don\'t hunt alone. Although Goblins are small and look weak, they are still monsters,\" the bear-like man said worriedly. \"If you\'re planning to hunt alone because you can\'t get a party, join us for a little bit and at least check out what the Goblins look like before you go off by yourself.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Tae-Soo, why did you decide that on your own?\" complained one of the bear-like man\'s party members.</span></p><p><span>\"That\'s right. If he has an F-rank Trait, he probably won\'t even be of help. So, just leave him alone,\" another chimed in.</span></p><p><span>\"Jeez! Don\'t you understand what situation this mister is in?!\" Tae-Soo, the bear-like man, shouted with a scowl.</span></p><p><span>The party members shuddered, feeling intimidated by his fierceness.</span></p><p><span>\"We\'re saving the life of a person. If you really don\'t want to, I\'ll give up my share of the mana stones. So, let him join,\" Tae-Soo insisted.</span></p><p><span>\"Sigh.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Well, as long as he doesn\'t bother us…\"</span></p><p><span>After hearing that Tae-Soo wouldn\'t take his cut of the mana stones, the rest of his party members clicked their tongues but nodded to show their acceptance.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Soo looked at them miserably before turning around to face Kang-Woo.</span></p><p><span>\"I\'m Kang Tae-Soo.

How about it? Join our party to get some experience. You don\'t need to feel burdened by it.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Thanks, but I\'m okay. It\'s not like I was planning to wander around mindlessly,\" Kang-Woo said very calmly.</span></p><p><span>Tae-Soo took a deep breath in. \"Well, if you say so, I guess there\'s nothing I can do. But be careful. If you happen to see a big brown Goblin, run. That\'s a monster called a Hobgoblin, the boss monster of this Gate.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Thanks for the information.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Stay safe!\"</span></p><p><span>Then Tae-Soo turned around and went into the forest with his two party members.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo smiled while watching Tae-Soo leave.</span></p><p><em><span>\'He\'s a good guy.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Although Tae-Soo was a bit quirky, he had wanted to help Kang-Soo, even if that meant he had to give up his share of the loot. If Kang-Woo really were a newbie Player with an F-rank Trait, Tae-Soo would have been of great help.</span></p><p><span>\"I should get going too.\" Kang-Woo turned around and left with a lighter feeling in his steps.</span></p><p><span>As he walked through the forest, Kang-Woo discovered a group of Goblins.</span></p><p><span>\"Kiiieeekkk!!\"</span></p><p><em><span>\'There seems to be around five of them.\'</span></em></p><p><em><span>Slash.</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo focused his demonic energy on his left hand, and a black blade shot out.</span></p><p><em><span>Stomp!</span></em></p><p><span>Moving as fast as a wild beast, Kang-Woo leaped toward the Goblins. The Goblins were objects of fear for most people who hunted in this Gate, but in Kang-Woo\'s eyes, they were nothing but prey that increased his demonic energy.</span></p><p><span>\"Kiiieeekkk!!\"</span></p><p><em><span>Crack! Slash!</span></em></p><p><span>The blade made of demonic energy sliced the Goblins\' necks in succession.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo had killed more than ten Goblins in the blink of an eye once before. Killing these five wasn\'t even enough to serve as a warm-up for him.</span></p><p><span>\"Kiieekk!! Krugh!\"</span></p><p><span>\"Kurrr…\"</span></p><p><span>\"Easy, as expected,\" Kang-Woo said.</span></p><p><span>It felt like fighting against a scarecrow.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo felt bored as he killed the last remaining Goblin. The Goblin\'s head dropped to the ground with a chilling thud.</span></p><p><em><span>Riiing.</span></em></p><p><span>[You have successfully defeated the E-rank monster Goblin.]</span></p><p><span>[Increasing EXP.]</span></p><p><span>[Your level has risen to 4.]</span></p><p><span>[Demonic Energy has risen by 1.]</span></p><p><em><span>\'I leveled up.\'&nbsp;</span></em><span>Kang-Woo\'s eyes lit up.</span></p><p><span>He had been too distracted the first time he had leveled up, so he hadn\'t paid attention to the changes.</span></p><p><span>This time, Kang-Woo opened his status window immediately and checked his current stats.</span></p><p><span>[Status Window]</span></p><p><span>[Player Name: Oh Kang-Woo</span></p><p><span>Level: 4 (First Awakening)</span></p><p><span>First Awakening Trait: Authority of Predation (Rank: ???) *The majority of the Trait\'s power is currently sealed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Strength: 9</span></p><p><span>Dexterity: 10</span></p><p><span>Health: 8</span></p><p><span>Mana: 0</span></p><p><span>Demonic Energy (Unique Stat): 14</span></p><p><span>Intelligence: 8</span></p><p><span>Wisdom: 7]</span></p><p><em><span>\'Interesting.\'</span></em></p><p><span>The status window, which reminded him of a game, surprised him no matter how many times he looked at it. The thing that interested him the most was the increase in stats.</span></p><p><em><span>\'My demonic energy really went up.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-woo had not used his Authority of Predation, nor had the seal on the Ten Thousand Demon Core become any weaker. Yet, the amount of demonic energy he possessed had increased with his stats. It was as if additional demonic energy had been created out of nothing.</span></p><p><span>\"This means I can also accumulate demonic energy by leveling up.\"</span></p><p><span>There was still one more reason for him to hunt monsters.</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo approached the Goblins\' corpses.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I\'ve already checked that demonic energy isn\'t in the mana stones.\'</span></em></p><p><span>He had to find out where they held demonic energy inside their bodies.</span></p><p><span>\"Predation.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo used his Authority of Predation to devour the Goblins\' corpses. Black smoke emerged from his body and enveloped the Goblins.</span></p><p><em><span>Crunch!</span></em></p><p><span>There was a chilling sound of skin being torn and bone being chewed. Kang-Woo deliberately avoided consuming the mana stone, from which he could sense mana, and instead consumed the other body parts one by one.</span></p><p><span>Once again, he could feel a little bit of demonic energy enter his body. Kang-Woo closed his eyes and tried to sense where the demonic energy was coming from. It did not take him very long to find out.</span></p><p><em><span>\'It\'s the body as a whole.\'</span></em></p><p><span>More accurately, it was coming from the monster\'s soul embedded in the body. The souls of recently deceased beings remained in their corpses, and that\'s where the demonic energy was coming from.</span></p><p><span>\"Which means…\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo could obtain demonic energy from monsters that he had just killed by using his Authority of Predation.</span></p><p><span>\"Nice.\"</span></p><p><span>From what he\'d heard, he could also obtain money by selling some parts of the monster\'s body, but the main source of income was the mana stone. He was willing to forgo selling the monster\'s bodies to gather more demonic energy.</span></p><p><span>After clearing out the Goblins\' corpses using Predation, he picked up an E-rank mana stone the size of a finger and put it in his bag.</span></p><p><em><span>\'It feels like I\'ve just finished eating a fried chicken, and only bones are left.\'</span></em></p><p><span>This was how he felt upon obtaining a mana stone after devouring the monsters\' corpses with Predation.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Speaking of chicken, I want to eat fried chicken.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo drooled at the sudden thought of fried chicken. Kimchi stew was good, but now he really wanted to eat fried chicken.</span></p><p><em><span>\'A freshly fried chicken with a cold beer…\'</span></em></p><p><span>Just thinking about it gave him chills.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Should I go now?\'</span></em></p><p><span>He was tempted to go out of the Gate immediately, but he ultimately shook his head.</span></p><p><span>\"I should keep hunting.\"</span></p><p><span>Kang-Woo had only just begun his demonic energy accumulation project. He really wanted to eat fried chicken, but he couldn\'t go back after killing just five Goblins.</span></p><p><em><span>\'I should take Seol-Ah out later and go to eat fried chicken together.\'</span></em></p><p><span>While thinking about food, Kang-Woo resumed walking through the forest.</span></p><p><em><span>\'What\'s that?\'</span></em></p><p><span>Kang-Woo\'s eyes lit up when he found some poorly built houses deep inside the forest. He then approached the area.</span></p><p><span>\"Kiieekk.\"</span></p><p><span>\"Krrrr.\"</span></p><p><span>There were dozens of Goblins here.</span></p><p><span>This was a Monster Hideout, the number one place that newbie Players should avoid. It was where the various monsters that a Player might encounter in a Gate gathered. Furthermore, it was the location that had the highest chance of a boss monster appearing. If a Player wasn\'t careful, they could end up dying even if they were with a party.</span></p><p><span>However…</span></p><p><span>\"Jackpot!\" Kang-Woo shouted after looking at the dozens of monsters.</span></p><p><span>He saw this place, which was the object of fear for most Players hunting in the gate, as a golden land full of riches.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Good.\'</span></em></p><p><span>With that many Goblins gathered, it meant he could obtain many mana stones and a lot of demonic energy at once. Devouring the corpses would give him demonic energy, and he could sell the remaining mana stones for a profit, which was the most important thing to him now.</span></p><p><em><span>\'Very nice.\'</span></em></p><p><span>Once he had money, he would be able to buy what he was craving, and there was only one thing he wanted at this moment.</span></p><p><span>\"Fried chicken, here I cooooooome!!!\"</span></p><p><span>While drooling at the thought of fried chicken, Kang-Woo leaped toward the Monster Hideout.</span></p><p><span>\"Half-fried and half-seasoned! Also, please give me lots of radish!!\" he shouted as if he\'d already entered a fried chicken restaurant.</span></p><p><span>Simultaneously, he slashed down on the Goblins\' necks with his black blade.</span></p><hr><div id=\"footnote-0a97\"><p><span>1.

During the day, even if one was wearing shorts he could heat up like a hot dog; yet during the night he had to curl up on his bed, freezing like a cold bird.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Nan University City.</p><p></p><p>2.30PM in the afternoon was exactly the time students started classes. Yet Song Shuhang stayed in his dormitory alone, his computer desk pulled to his bedside, making it convenient for him to watch movies in any posture.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang did not have a habit of skipping classes. For the earlier half of last night, the weather was hot and stuffy, so in his dreams he executed a move called ‘Twin Dragon Emerging From The Seas’ and knocked over his blanket.</p><p></p><p>During the later half of the night, the air temperature dramatically decreased. With only a pair of shorts on his body, Song Shuhang was forced into bitter hardship. While slumbering away, both his hands strenuously groped the bed, seeking all over, yet he couldn’t find the blanket. In the end he could only curl up like a mantis shrimp, shivering in the tyrannical cold of midnight.</p><p></p><p>When the sun rose, Song Shuhang had already become a member of the great seasonal catching cold army.</p><p></p><p>His roommate had already helped him apply for time off for today’s classes.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he took cold medicine and slept till now.</p><p></p><p>The high fever was suppressed, but his body was still weak. In this condition there was no way he could attend classes. Therefore, he could only stay in the dormitory bored and lonely, and watch movies.</p><p></p><p>On the monitor, the movie’s playback bar slowly trickled towards the end, but Song Shuhang was not absorbed into its contents at all.</p><p></p><p>“Has the medicine’s effects still not worn off? I’m so sleepy.” Song Shuhang yawned, he felt his eyelids getting heavy.</p><p></p><p>‘Di di di~’ Suddenly, at the bottom right of the computer screen, the chat application’s icon jumped.</p><p></p><p>This meant that someone added him as a friend, or invited him to join a chat group.</p><p></p><p>“Who added me?” Song Shuhang mumbled, he extended his hand and gently tapped on the bottom right of the computer’s touchscreen, prompting the notification to appear.</p><p></p><p>[Mt.

Just who would use such an odd nickname?</p><p></p><p>“Is he a student from my class?” Song Shuhang wondered silently. He couldn’t help but think of the others in his class who clearly were already in university yet were still full of youthful delusions. If it were them, they would definitely pick an odd nickname like this.</p><p></p><p>Once he thought this way, he tapped on ‘Accept’.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, what followed was another system notification popping up.</p><p></p><p>[Mt.

He was now filled with sleepiness, where would he get the energy to care about the group he joined?</p><p></p><p>Anyways, his group chat settings had always been ‘Do not notify new posts, only show numbers unread’, messages by the group wouldn’t pop-up and disturb him, it would only show the total number of new messages in the background.</p><p></p><p>After he wakes up, he could flip open the chat record, then he would know what kind of group he joined, and the chat record would also not be lost.</p><p></p><p>His eyelids got heavier and heavier……</p><p></p><p>The movie’s playback bar continued to move forward tenaciously, but Song Shuhang’s consciousness got more and more fuzzy.</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>In Nine Provinces (1) Group, lurkers emerged as soon as they noticed the new member’s entry.</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner: “Has the new member that Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch invited come in yet? It has already been a year since a new member joined right?”</p><p></p><p>Another ID, ‘Su Clan’s Ah Qi’ speedily replied, “There’s a new fellow daoist? Which region of Huaxia is this fellow daoist from? Which cave does fellow daoist cultivate in? What’s fellow daoist’s Dao name? What level of cultivation is fellow daoist at?”</p><p>(TL: Huaxia is the archaic name for China)</p><p></p><p>This chain of questions, why did they seem somewhat strange?</p><p></p><p>At approximately the same time, a new message came from the ID Mad Saber Three Waves, “What is the new fellow daoist’s gender? Are you a fairy or no? If you are, give the size of your bust, waist, and buttocks, and post a photo!”</p><p></p><p>Seeing the new messages by Su Clan’s Ah Qi and Mad Saber Three Waves, quite a number of other members’ mouths twitched.</p><p></p><p>“Brother Three Waves, is your zodiac indeed a goldfish?” North River’s Loose Practitioner sighed, “You better not invite death by recklessness again. What if Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch once again invited some big time senior in?”</p><p></p><p>Everything was good about Three Waves, he’s friendly, loyal, and loves helping others, so his relationship with others was pretty good. The only problem is he liked to speak pervertedly, in a way that invites death.</p><p></p><p>It turns out that this fella’s luck was so low that it gives people goosebumps, he always couldn’t help but invite death from recklessness, and the ones he offended were always big time seniors. Since those big time seniors were usually bored without any source of entertainment, they were naturally very happy to torture Mad Saber Three Waves who personified entertainment delivered to their front doors..</p><p></p><p>“I kneel and beg you not to mention the words “big time seniors”, they are a dark shadow in this majesty’s heart.” Mad Saber Three Waves sent a line of “crying face” emojis.</p><p>(TL: Mad Saber Three Waves called himself “本座” but there’s no English term for this so I translated it as “this majesty” if you have a better term to suggest do let me know!)</p><p></p><p>Four years ago this crappy mouth of his offended a beautiful ‘big time senior’, and was miserably tortured…… That big time senior continuously tortured him for an entire year and four months. You didn’t hear wrongly, a whole year and four months! When he thought of that tumultuous and inhuman times, his eyes turned moist.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after Three Waves spoke, emojis of naughty smiles popped up one after another in the group, they were not even trying to conceal how much they were enjoying his misery.</p><p></p><p>The group channel showed that among the last eight people who sent messages, 6 of them neatly sent a string of smiling emojis.</p><p></p><p>“You bunch of people who take joy in others’ calamity, this majesty will remember each and every one of you. Do not let this majesty meet you, otherwise this majesty will definitely let you people taste the strength of my 72 Paths of Rapid Saber!” Mad Saber Three Waves angrily said. He was very confident in his Rapid Saber. Among the 6 people who were leaving naughty smiles, none of them were a match for him in a one on one.</p><p></p><p>The moment after Mad Saber Three Waves spoke.</p><p></p><p>Another naughty smile emoji popped up, belonging to Su Clan’s Ah Qi.</p><p></p><p>Su Clan’s Ah Qi happily followed with: “When do you want fight one on one?”</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Su Clan’s Ah Qi didn’t have any intention of taking joy in others’ calamity, he just wanted to fight with someone.</p><p></p><p>“……” Mad Saber Three Waves immediately withered.</p><p></p><p>It was because he couldn’t beat Ah Qi!</p><p></p><p>His cultivation was profound. He had already reached the 5th level late stage Spirit Lord, and was just a hair’s breath from 6th level Spirit Lord, but he couldn’t beat Ah Qi in a fight.</p><p></p><p>His 72 Paths Saber technique was both fast and fierce, and he also possessed lightning fast body techniques, yet he still couldn’t defeat Ah Qi.</p><p></p><p>He was known as Mad Saber, his wrath terrifies even he himself, but he just couldn’t beat Ah Qi!</p><p></p><p>When the others in the group saw Three Waves wilting, they unbridledly sent lines of smiling emojis once again.</p><p></p><p>“……” This time, Mad Saber Three Waves could only sullenly post a line of dots.</p><p></p><p>The people in the group had been noisy for so long, yet they still hadn’t heard a word from the new member, which made them feel a little baffled.</p><p></p><p>“Our new fellow daoist is not making a sound?” North River’s Loose Practitioner asked.</p><p></p><p>That’s right, because of the cold medicine’s effects, Song Shuhang had once again entered a half asleep state.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Su Clan’s Ah Qi happily sent a piece of news: “I took a look, the new fellow daoist is called ‘Mt. Books’ Huge Pressure’. Has anyone heard of an expert with this dao name? This dao name sounds a little like a scholarly sect’s practitioner? This is so exciting! These years, scholarly sects’ practitioners have been living very deeply in seclusion so it’s not even possible to find them. It has already been nearly a hundred years since I’ve fought with them!</p><p></p><p>Now that I think about it, scholarly sects’ practitioners are even more unwilling to fight than buddhist sects’. Not only are they adept at glib speech, but their fists are also hard. Moreover, when the fight gets interesting they will heroically hum poetry to make things multiple times more fun! I love fighting them the most.”</p><p></p><p>“Ah Qi, when it comes to new fellow daoists, are you forever only interested in whether they could be a good fight, and whether it is fun to fight them?” Mad Saber Three Waves sent a crying face emoji. This is practically an evil tyrant’s way you know?!</p><p></p><p>“Erm.” Su Clan’s Ah Qi felt a little embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner smirked nastily and said, “Could it be he’s another big time senior who doesn’t know how to use the chatting tool?”</p><p></p><p>Once he said that, everyone started to feel like, isn’t this the scene of being ignored?</p><p></p><p>That’s right, right about four years ago there seemed to have been a senior who came out of closed-door cultivation after over a hundred years. She too had difficulties getting on the chatting software, and was added to the group by Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch. Yet because she didn’t know how to type, she couldn’t send messages.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, someone named Mad Saber Three Waves happily spoke like a pervert in front of this senior, asked for the senior to post her three sizes, asked her to send her photo, and also asked for voice chat etc.</p><p></p><p>Then…… A few days after, Mad Saber Three Waves saw this senior with his own eyes. She was a very pretty senior, dazzling and beautiful like the bright moon in the night sky.</p><p></p><p>What followed after that was, this pretty senior tortured Mad Saber Three Waves for an entire one year and four months, before she left perfectly satisfied.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Mad Saber Three waves suddenly kneeled.</p><p></p><p>“Mt. Yellow?” This time, someone with the ID ‘Medicine Master’ sent a message.</p><p></p><p>An unfathomable and brief message, with no head nor tails.</p><p></p><p>Luckily the group members had long been accustomed to Medicine Master’s short messaging habits, is he asking where the group master Mt. Yellow True Monarch is?</p><p></p><p>The reason Medicine Master’s messages are short wasn’t because he had a cold and proud nature. Instead, it was because he was doing two-finger push-ups while in handwriting mode, which made his speed outrageously slow. When he increased the number of words written there would also be more chances of a mistake, and to keep deleting and rewriting was peerlessly painful. This was why Medicine Master’s messages were as short as possible. As time passed, it became like this, a socializing style with words as rare as gold.</p><p></p><p>“He went offline immediately after sending the invitation, I heard his family’s treasured Great Devil Dog got angry and left home again, Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch chased after it again.”</p><p></p><p>“……” Medicine Master.</p><p></p><p>“In that case, we can only wait for our new fellow daoist to learn how to use the chatting tool before we chat.” Su Clan’s Ah Qi sighed. They all knew first impression was the strongest, and believed that the new member was also one of them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the new fellow daoist had no reaction, the others online weren’t entertained, then gradually lurked.</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>Approximately one hour later, Song Shuhang gradually became more clear-headed as he woke up.</p><p></p><p>“I remember that just a moment ago, someone added me to a group, the Nine Provinces (1) group.” he muttered softly. Conveniently expanding the chat tool on the lower right part of the screen, he brought up the Nine Provinces (1)’s chat window.</p><p></p><p>What kind of group is this?</p><p></p><p>In an instant, one hour’s worth of chat logs appeared on the screen.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang roughly skimmed through it.</p><p></p><p>Fellow Daoist? Cultivation cave? Cultivation level?</p><p></p><p>There’s even seniors? True Monarch? This majesty? Hunting down the Great Devil Dog?</p><p></p><p>All kinds of vocabulary straight from Xianxia Novels.</p><p></p><p>The way people talked in this group was also very peculiar, ancient, but not entirely ancient, plain, but not entirely plain. This type of speech gave people the feel of a modern person trying to sound ancient. Unfortunately, lacking knowledge in the fundamentals of “classical chinese”, it led to a very awkward exchange.</p><p></p><p>“Chi~~” Song Shuhang started audibly laughing.</p><p></p><p>It seems that this was a XianXia aficionado group?</p><p></p><p>Oh no, this definitely wasn’t the normal Xianxia fan group!</p><p></p><p>Every single member in this group had given themselves a dao name, the place they live in was called a cultivation cave, even the pet the group master lost was described as family’s Great Devil Dog abandoning his home. There’s even someone who proclaimed that he had not fought with any scholarly sects for over a hundred years or something.  Doesn’t that mean that person claimed to have already lived several hundred years?</p><p></p><p>Looking at this log, Song Shuhang developed a feeling of shame.</p><p></p><p>“To be obsessed to this degree, it seems like they have already been afflicted by Chuunibyou syndrome. Furthermore, it is a very specific Huaxia-flavored Xianxia disease.” Song Shuhang concluded.</p><p></p><p>Seems like, this was the Xianxia chuunibyou victims’ assembling point!</p><p></p><p>This was his first impression of the members in ‘Nine Provinces (1) Group.’</p><p></p><p>But why did they decide to add him?</p><p></p><p>Looking at the account information of Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch, Song Shuhang determined that this person was not his classmate, he definitely not did recognise this guy at all.</p><p></p><p>Was this an accidental invite?  				</p>'),(12,2,'Chapter 2 Please Wait For Esteemed Me To Divinate',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 2: Please Wait For Esteemed Me To Divinate</p><p>People always say that the second year of middle school is a rebellious age.</p><p></p><p>Everyone more-or-less goes through that phase, but only some people show it to the world to see, while others tuck it deep inside their hearts. This was also the difference between obvious trouble and secret trouble.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang could be considered to have matured early. That phase of his life came quick and left even quicker.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when he reached his second year of middle school, while his classmates were still stuck in their wuxia, superhero, immortal dreams and constantly brandishing their “18 Falling Dragon Palms” while transforming into superheroes. Song Shuhang had long lost those desires.</p><p></p><p>Our world’s laws of physics were already so precise. To be able to jump three-storeys? To be able to summon a golden dragon with your palm strikes?  To be able to fly by wearing your underwear on the outside? Those things were simply impossible!</p><p></p><p>However, he still liked xianxia novels, superhero movies and the like.  Perhaps deep inside his heart, he still hoped that one day, superheroes, aliens, and immortals could appear in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He obviously knew that all these were impossible, but weirdly, he still looked forward to that day with anticipation. Could this be mankind’s talent?</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang laughed as he closed the group’s chat window, however, he didn’t leave the group.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the people in the Nine Provinces (1) Group were interesting, and those chat records of the group could make anybody who sees it feel embarrassed. From a spectator’s point of view, it was unexpectedly interesting. So before the group master decided to kick him out, he plans to first lurk around, then take a look at the various kinds of interesting chat records to kill boredom.</p><p></p><p>On the computer’s screen, the movie was still playing. It seemed like it was a horror flick. Every single plot device you could find in horror was shown, evidently proving that this movie was directed by a genius horror director at the peak of his performance. It was said that this movie had made even middle-aged men cry in fright, and frightened a ton of people to the point of being afraid of going to the bathroom alone.</p><p></p><p>However, Song Shuhang did not receive any feelings of fright. Instead, he pulled the progress bar backwards. After watching for a while more, he yawned again and slowly transitioned from his sitting posture to a lying posture, finding his eyelids to also become increasingly heavy.</p><p></p><p>If that genius director knew that his movie only had this little effect, wouldn’t he cry?</p><p></p><p>Dazed, Song Shuhang had a fanciful dream.</p><p></p><p>It was an extremely fun and beautiful dream, a really beautiful dream. There were immortals, superheroes, and all kinds of mythical lands.</p><p></p><p>To live a long and free life. To be able to move the mountains and the oceans. Tread through the world wielding a sword. Since ancient times, how many people have had this dream? Only, as one grew older, reality broke this dream. People could only tuck it deep in their hearts, and not think about it.</p><p></p><p>In the end, dreams are only dreams.</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>The next day. Tuesday. 21st May. 1AM.</p><p></p><p>Inside the group chat, the group master Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch finally came online.</p><p></p><p>The moment he got online, North River’s Loose Practitioner popped up with a question: “True Monarch, who is ‘Mt. Books’ Huge Pressure’ you added yesterday? Where does he cultivate from?”</p><p></p><p>“The person added yesterday? You guys haven’t exchanged words yet? That is the daughter of esteemed me’s old friend who is born in this era, it seems like her aptitude isn’t bad. So young and she is already at the peak of 3rd stage – Houtian, just about to reach 4th stage – Xiantian. She is truly extraordinary.” Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch replied laughing.</p><p></p><p>“If she’s born in this era, then her age probably does not exceed 40? To be able to achieve the peak of 3rd stage – Houtian, at such an age, this person truly is a genius.” North River’s Loose Practitioner inwardly nodded. Yet the dao name that person had taken was very odd, ‘Mt. Books’ Huge Pressure’ didn’t seem like a dao name.</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner was still thinking when suddenly, Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch said, “Huh? Esteemed me’s old friend’s daughter’s dao name isn’t ‘Mt. Books’ Huge Pressure’! Then, who the hell is this Mt. Books’ Huge Pressure?</p><p></p><p>“…..” Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch’s face turned into the shape ‘囧’.</p><p></p><p>This wasn’t some random person. True Monarch, this was the unknown person you added yesterday.</p><p></p><p>Probing the situation, North River’s Loose Practitioner asked, “True Monarch, could it be that you have added the wrong person?”</p><p></p><p>“Let esteemed me check it out.”</p><p></p><p>After a short moment.</p><p></p><p>With a line of cold sweat emojis, Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch sent out a couple of words to the chat: “I truly added the wrong person. The ID number’s only difference was the middle character. Esteemed me entered a 9 instead of an 8. Never would’ve expected that esteemed me could make such a mistake.”</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner sarcastically laughed: “Just as I said, even if one has assimilated into modern society, there still wouldn’t be a person who would set their dao name as ‘Mt. Books’ Huge Pressure’ right!”</p><p></p><p>Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch followed up by sending another line of cold sweat emojis.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he hastily brought his good friend’s daughter into the chat once more.</p><p></p><p>The group notification prompted: ‘Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather’ has entered Nine Provinces (1) Group.</p><p></p><p>This name kept up with the Nine Provinces (1) Group’s style, with the rich Xianxia air assaulting your senses. As for Mt. Books’ Huge Pressure, this name surely must’ve been something strange that snuck in.</p><p></p><p>The moment someone new joined, Mad Saber Three Waves immediately emerged: “Oh? The new fellow daoist is a fairy? Post your photo and report the size of your bust, waist, and buttocks! If you’re beautiful why not we date?”</p><p></p><p>Mad Saber Three Waves has lurked for a long time. His zodiac may be a goldfish, but in the end his memorization capabilities could still last more than 3 seconds. Yesterday he was already reminded that he should avoid offending big time seniors, so today he carefully lurked and evaluated the situation.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch state that this person was his good friend’s daughter, and that her cultivation level was at the peak of the 3rd stage – Houtian, Mad Saber Three Waves became at ease. If it wasn’t someone from the older generation, then he could tease as much as he wanted, satiating his cravings.</p><p></p><p>In this group, newcomers were extremely rare, so he had to fiercely hold it in all this time.</p><p></p><p>The moment Mad Saber Three Waves opened his mouth, Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch’s face immediately darkened.</p><p></p><p>“…..” Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather sent a line of dots in the chat, then sent another line: “As it is late, this old man’s daughter has already proceeded to meditate and practice. Her number will temporarily be used by this old man until fellow daoist Mt. Yellow adds me to this group. Ahem… I’ve long heard that Nine Province (1) Group’s fellow daoist, Three Waves is exceptionally outstanding, easygoing and has the gift of the gab. It seems a hundred gossips cannot compare to a single meeting. Fellow daoist Three Waves, this old man appreciates you. Another day, I’ll invite you to drink with me.”</p><p></p><p>Mad Saber Three Waves immediately felt awkward. To think that while he was flirting around with a girl, the father would turn up! In this world, there is nothing as shameful as that. He urgently wanted to find a hole in the ground and get into it.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it seemed that this senior had an amiable temperament as he lightly brushed it off with a few words.</p><p></p><p>Continuing on, this senior introduced himself to the rest of the group that was online and requested that everybody take care of his daughter in the future. Then, he finally lurked before he disconnected.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that this senior left, Mad Saber Three Waves let out a breath of air, cheerfully he went, “Luckily, it seems like this senior can take a joke. Perhaps in the future, I’ll have an opportunity to talk to Lady Soft Feather herself.”</p><p></p><p>“…..” Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch.</p><p></p><p>“…..” North River’s Loose Practitioner.</p><p></p><p>The hard to come by Medicine Master then emerged. He’s a man who held his words like gold. He rarely spoke out, yet this time he actually entered four words: “Hoping for too much.”</p><p></p><p>“?” Three Waves was confused.</p><p></p><p>But Medicine Master who treated words like gold naturally wouldn’t explain any further.</p><p></p><p>“Look at the new member’s dao name’s prefix.” North River’s Loose Practitioner explained, if one doesn’t court death he wouldn’t die, will brother Three Waves forever be unable to understand this principle?</p><p></p><p>“Prefix? Spiritual Butterfly Island?” It was as if Mad Saber Three Waves still had no reaction.</p><p></p><p>“That’s right, Spiritual Butterfly Island! To add on to that a senior! Does that not remind you of someone?” North River’s Loose Practitioner pointed out.</p><p></p><p>After quite a while, Mad Saber Three Waves suddenly understood, and sent a line of ‘kneeling’ emojis, “It’s that Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage that fusses over every single detail?”</p><p></p><p>Honourable Spiritual Butterfly was a strong senior. Everything about him was good; he’s upright and chivalrous……. It’s just that he liked to argue with others about all kinds of insignificant things, and had reached the peak of the dao of fussing over minor details. While others may fuss over minor details, he fusses over every single detail!</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner was angry to the point that his mouth was twitching: “This wasn’t how I warned you!”</p><p></p><p>Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch sighed, he truly couldn’t bear to keep watching. “Three Waves, that old friend of mine only minimized the chat group, he hasn’t gone offline.”</p><p></p><p>Which means…… The chat record might be seen.</p><p></p><p>No, it would definitely be seen!</p><p></p><p>Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch truly couldn’t bear to keep watching Three Waves court death, no matter what, he was still his chat group’s junior.</p><p></p><p>“Fuck me, I’m dead.” It was as if Mad Saber Three Waves has peeked into the near future where Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage would come to pay him a visit, and execute all sorts of torture onto him. His eyes were once again moist. It seems like this time, he may have offended an even more troublesome big time senior?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Three Waves screamed, “True Monarch, please help me intercede!”</p><p></p><p>Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch gave an emoji that showed a cold back figure.</p><p></p><p>The people of the chat group no longer paid attention to Three Waves’ wails that sounded like those of a defeated dog, and changed topics.</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner asked the group master, “How are you going to deal with ‘Mt. Books’ High Pressure’?”</p><p></p><p>Su Clan’s Ah Qi said, “Do you want to kick him? After all he’s just an ordinary person, and so he’s not really suitable to chat with us.”</p><p></p><p>“Ahem, since it was an accidental invite by esteemed me, it can also be considered fate. Let esteemed me calculate a divination, then decide how to handle this.” Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch replied. The main point was that he suddenly invited the other party into the group, if he just kicked him now, won’t it mean that he loses a lot of face?</p><p></p><p>Which was why at the very least he should use divination to pretend for a bit as an excuse, then kick the person afterwards.</p><p></p><p>First, this way, it would demonstrate his grand and magnificent style.</p><p></p><p>Second, not long ago he suddenly felt a great interest towards divination. He had studied it for a few months, so his hands were now itching for action. No matter what he does, he liked to calculate its divine value beforehand.</p><p></p><p>With that said, using the book 《Tang Verses Song Phrases》 as a base for his divination, he waved his hands, and executed a secret technique of divination. This shamanic power extracted the meaning from the lyrics of a poem, and formed the shape of a trigram.</p><p></p><p>His execution of divination this time went extremely smoothly. Since Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch first began learning how to divinate, this was the first time he experienced this feeling while executing the divination technique!</p><p></p><p>With a happy face he looked at the divinatory trigram’s results.</p><p></p><p>Then……</p><p></p><p>Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch’s face turned downcast.</p><p></p><p>Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch’s complexion turned ugly.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the divinatory trigram: Willing to be two birds flying wing to wing in the sky, on earth willing to be two trees with branches intertwined.</p><p>(TL: This means wishing for conjugal bliss)</p><p></p><p>In his memory this verse was written by a poet Bai Juyi during the Tang Dynasty, a true classic. From then on it was used by people to describe love?</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch felt depressed.</p><p></p><p>Wing to wing my ass, intertwining branches my ass! Willing to be a intertwining branch, esteemed me might as well hang myself on the southeast branch!</p><p>(TL: Suicide)</p><p></p><p>It can’t be that he, the great Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch has to go to that likely male ‘Mt. Books’ High Pressure’ and conduct an inseparable world-shaking romance? This led him to think of Long Yangjun from Huaxia’s Warring States period. This made him feel as if he just swallowed a cockroach, ridiculously disgusted.</p><p></p><p>“This definitely is because esteemed me’s cultivation level in divination techniques is insufficient. After all I have only studied it for a month…… So esteemed me should try calculating the divinatory trigram once more! That’s right, this must be it!” Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch once again executed the divination secret technique, the deep energies once again flipped 《Tang Verses Song Phrases》.</p><p></p><p>Again, the meaning of another verse was extracted.</p><p></p><p>This time the divination secret technique revolved incredibly smoothly, Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch felt great, it will surely hit the target!</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the divinatory trigram.</p><p></p><p>Then……</p><p></p><p>True Monarch’s face paled.</p><p></p><p>Divinatory trigram: “After being together for a long time, even if a pair has been separated, how can their relationship easily change from sunrise to sunset!”</p><p></p><p>Sunset your grandfather!</p><p></p><p>“Esteemed me doesn’t believe in this supernatural bullshit!” Mt. Yellow True Monarch once again reset the trigram.</p><p></p><p>This time he felt even more mighty. Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch felt his divinatory trigram cultivation level increasing by leaps and bounds at this moment!</p><p></p><p>This time will hit the mark for sure!</p><p></p><p>He looked down to see the divinatory trigram: “Turn back suddenly, and discover that your destined person is there, by the waning lantern lights.”</p><p></p><p>“…….”</p><p></p><p>“Deep breaths, deep breaths.” Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch had firmly decided on what to do with the 《Tang Verses Song Phrases》. Tilting his head 45 degrees upwards, he looked depressedly up towards the sky, what a melancholic feeling!</p><p></p><p>Continuing on, True Monarch resolutely tore apart the hardcover version of 《Tang Verses Song Phrases》 in his hands. While ripping it apart he forcefully nodded: “Sure enough, esteemed me does not possess talent in the area of divination techniques and wasn’t made to be a divination master. Therefore, the divinatory trigram’s results that esteemed me acquired must all be failures!”</p><p></p><p>He then tossed the torn 《Tang Verses Song Phrases》 to one side, in his heart he silently vowed never again to cheaply divinate anything!</p><p></p><p>With the hardcover Verses Phrases torn and thrown to the side, True Monarch typed, “That Mt. Books’ High Pressure…… Let’s keep him for now. Esteemed me just divinated, and discovered that he and esteemed me are connected by fate. Adding him to the group was no random accident, it was inevitable! As for what the future holds for him, that will depend on his luck.”</p><p></p><p>True Monarch used vocabulary from various divination techniques. As for the divinatory trigram’s results, he wouldn’t reveal a word even if someone beat him to death!</p><p></p><p>Damn, even if there was fate, that fate definitely was a bastardly fate!</p><p></p><p>“Then let’s leave it be for now. Anyways he would probably leave the group soon enough. Come to think of it, what was the result of True Monarch’s divinatory calculation?” North River’s Loose Practitioner had heard before that True Monarch was learning divination techniques, and so he was very curious as to what this senior had divined.</p><p></p><p>“…..” Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch: “Oh right, you guys continue chatting, I have an urgent matter so I’ll leave first.”</p><p></p><p>Finishing his words, he rapidly went offline leaving behind the bewildered North River’s Loose Practitioner.  				</p>'),(13,2,'Chapter 3 One Pill Recipe',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 3: One Pill Recipe</p><p></p><p>The sun hung high in the sky. It was precisely noon.</p><p></p><p>Since his roommates knew that Song Shuhang had not yet recovered from his cold, they had already asked for another day of sick leave for him so that he could rest well.</p><p></p><p>“Why do I feel like my illness is getting more serious? Is it because I haven’t been exercising much lately, which led to my body’s condition worsening?” Song Shuhang wondered.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, there was a bowl of century egg porridge. His roommates had brought this for him during lunchtime.</p><p></p><p>“What a nice bunch!” Song Shuhang unhesitantly placed them in his friend zone.</p><p></p><p>After he’d slept for god knows how long, he was so hungry that his chest stuck to his back. He then raked the century egg porridge into his mouth before he switched on his computer again.</p><p></p><p>When he habitually opened the group chat software, he saw the red dot that specified the number of latest messages in the ‘Nine Provinces (1) Group’.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang curiously extended his hand to open the Nine Provinces (1) Group tab, wanting to see what the Xianxia aficionado chunnibyous had talked about throughout the night.</p><p></p><p>The chat logs of the early morning surfaced before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner’s questions related to the ‘newcomer’, Mad Saber Three Waves’ death-seeking ways, the interesting senior from the Spiritual Butterfly Island. There’s also Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch who had claimed he had divined that they were brought together by fate just by using a divination technique once.</p><p></p><p>As he looked at the chatlogs, the images of these few people began to fill Shuhang’s mind.</p><p></p><p>“So it’s because they added the wrong person. Like I said, I don’t even recognise this Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch.”</p><p></p><p>Judging from the chatlogs, it seems like not just anyone could freely join this group? A member’s recommendation was needed to enter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the age of this bunch of xianxia aficionados all didn’t seem to be young. There was even someone who had a daughter.</p><p></p><p>To add-on, from his tone, it seemed that his daughter was no longer young? Then with some calculations, perhaps he was already forty to fifty years old. Already so old but still stuck in chuuni. His daughter must have suffered a lot.</p><p></p><p>Skimming through the chat logs, Song Shuhang maintained his lurking mode, unconditionally remaining silent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the group members act foolishly was a very interesting thing, but if he joined in, what would it then be considered as? He doesn’t act foolishly anyways.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, his plan was to just lurk, read the chat logs and get a few laughs everyday.</p><p></p><p>If there’s one day that he felt that this chat group has become boring, he would just quit Nine Provinces (1) Group.</p><p></p><p>This was how he had always thought.</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, ten days had already passed.</p><p></p><p>June 1st. Saturday, Children’s Day.</p><p>[TL: Holiday in China]</p><p></p><p>Shuhang’s roommates were all half-boarders and half day-schoolers. What that meant was that they stayed in the dorms from to Monday to Friday and went home on weekends. So whenever the weekend came, only one lonely person, him, would be left in the dorms.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang had already recuperated from his cold, but he was still suffering from a stuffy nose and a cough. These coughs from the cold were more troublesome to recover from. If it was not well taken care of, these coughs could last a couple of months.</p><p></p><p>As he rested on Saturday, Shuhang slept till 8AM before waking up. Then, he went to the cafeteria and ate some lightly flavored food.</p><p></p><p>With nothing to do, he returned to the dormitory.</p><p></p><p>After opening his computer, he had already become accustomed to visiting the chat logs of the Nine Provinces (1) Group. This was now his main way of passing the time.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, he had joined this group for 10 days already.</p><p></p><p>While lurking these past 10 days, he saw that the majority of the people in the group were chatting about which secret realm to intrude, and how much rewards they’ll reap. Other than that, there were also talks about where the evil ghosts and demons had appeared, and whether to tame or behead them.</p><p></p><p>They talked like all of this was real. Song Shuhang was thinking, if he were to take the contents of this chat log, polish it up a bit, then post it online as a Xianxia Novel, he could make quite a bit of money from royalties.</p><p></p><p>Within these past 10 days, Song Shuhang recognized quite a number of people from the group.</p><p></p><p>For example, the rarely seen group master, Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the two moderators who had never appeared since he joined this group, Daluo Sect’s Rainmoon True Monarch and Seven Path’s Respected Sage.</p><p></p><p>The frequently online included ‘intelligence reporter’ North River’s Loose Practitioner, death-seeking Mad Saber Three Waves, Su Clan’s Ah Qi who wanted to fight with or without speaking, and Medicine Master whose words were as hard to come by as gold.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was also the constantly lurking Roaming Cloud Monk Tong Xuan who only posted emoticons even when he surfaced in the chat. It was rumoured that this High Monk has been training in silent meditation. He was not only unable to speak but also even unable to type. At most, he could send an emoticon.</p><p></p><p>Finally, amongst this somewhat chunni group, there was Spirit Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather who spoke normally. Her number was only one digit away from Song Shuhang’s. Only by riding on her good fortune did Shuhang receive the opportunity to enter this Nine Provinces (1) group.</p><p></p><p>These reports were obtained by him when North River’s Loose Practitioner passionately introduced the group’s members to Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>Today, upon opening the Nine Provinces (1) Chat, the first thing he saw was a message from the Medicine Master.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine Master, whose words were as hard to come by as gold, sent: “Improved a foundation pill formula.”</p><p></p><p>Including the punctuation mark, this was a six word sentence! From the moment he joined the group, Song Shuhang had never seen the Medicine Master post such a long message. So he continued to read on.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine Master’s news was posted in the early morning.</p><p></p><p>“Simplified Pill Recipe for Body Tempering Liquid: Ginseng 3 liang, Goji Berries 4 liang 3 qian;Morning Dew Mysterious Grass; Rising Sun Stone 3 liang, Maiden’s Fragrance 1 liang 3 qian….. Fresh Overlord Branch 1 liang, thinly sliced Nine-Yang Scarlet Flame Bamboo 4 liang…..”</p><p>[TL: 1 liang = 50g; 1 qian = 5g]</p><p></p><p>Listing 45 types of medicinal ingredients in succession, amongst them, there were familiar looking ingredients like Ginseng and Goji Berries, but there were also the rarely heard Rising Sun Stone and the unheard-before ingredients, Morning Dew Mysterious Grass, Fresh Overlord Branches, the Nine-Yang Scarlet Flame Bamboo and such.</p><p></p><p>“Follow the proportion of the recipe and put them one by one into the pill furnace, simmer it for five minutes, insert the next herb, then simmer for five minutes, insert next herb and repeat. Pay attention to the fire’s temperature! By using this process, the medicinal liquid would turn into a paste. A successfully completed Body Tempering Liquid should be black in colour, transparent, and with a strong smell..”</p><p></p><p>Easy to understand!</p><p></p><p>Out of the 40-over ingredients, there were many that Song Shuhang did not recognize. Curiously, he went only to look them up.</p><p></p><p>In the pill formula, there were 30 ingredients from common chinese medicine, all for improving your qi, blood and such.</p><p></p><p>There were still 15 ingredients such as Morning Dew Mysterious Grass, Fresh Overlord Branch, and Scarlet Flame Bamboo which he had never heard of, it can’t be that this ‘Medicine Master’ from the group is making up things right?</p><p></p><p>“These people have sunk too deep into this delusion, they even made up medicinal formulas! It can’t be that someone would really follow this formula and consume that medicinal paste right?” Song Shuhang wondered.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit anxious, because as rice could be eaten in any way you like, but medicine could not be randomly taken!</p><p></p><p>Wouldn’t indiscriminately eating medicine lead to death? How about advising this group of chuunibyou not to? No matter how you put it, Song Shuhang had already been in this chat for 10 days.</p><p></p><p>If someone in this group happened to die from recklessly eating medicine, he too would feel a bit guilty</p><p></p><p>Continuing on, upon checking the chat, he realized that some people had already followed the instructions!</p><p></p><p>It turns out that it was the one that seemed the most normal in the chat, Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather, that responded at around 2 in the morning.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather: “Compared to the old formula, this one is lacking in alot of rare medicinal ingredients. The process is also simplified by a lot. Medicine Master, what temperature should the fire be? I just tried, but the result was it had failed midway. Also, how much of the medicinal effectiveness is decreased in comparison to the original?”</p><p></p><p>“Effect 2:1.” Said Medicine Master.</p><p></p><p>Medicine effectiveness was only half from before, after all many precious herbs were lessened. But with such normal mass-oriented medicinal ingredients, to still be able to form a Body Tempering Liquid, it would be considered a profit even so.</p><p></p><p>“The temperature and specific timings has to be grasped yourself, it cannot be explained.” Medicine Master once again sent a rare long line of words, only when it came to questions about pill concoctions would he clench his teeth and enter a few more words, “Also, if your fire control arts aren’t good enough, I recommend you utilize a treasure for fire control.”</p><p></p><p>“Thank you senior, I will try again.” Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather sent a smiley, then returned to lurking.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather’s final message was at 2:30AM in the morning, if she went to concoct pills after that, judging from the time she should already have concocted a few furnaces of pills right?</p><p></p><p>It could kill right? From the start, this bunch of chuunibyous were already very silly, if they ate the wrong medicine too, wouldn’t they become super silly? Originally, they could probably be saved, but right now if they ate that medicine then there would truly be no hope for rescue!</p><p></p><p>His conscience finally took over, and he couldn’t help but enter into the chat window, “Medicine cannot be randomly taken!”</p><p></p><p>Right as he was about to knock on the Enter key, and send his first sentence in this group……The chat window vibrated.</p><p></p><p>A large smiley popped out from the group chat’s avatar.</p><p></p><p>It was the moderator who hadn’t appeared from when Song Shuhang entered the chat group Seven Path’s Respected Sage, “This recipe is great, I just tried simultaneously concocting it in seven furnaces, and all of them easily succeeded. The success rate is very high. I’ve tried some and the effectiveness of the medicine is slightly more than half of the old version of Body Tempering Liquid. But the cost of manufacturing this recipe is only a tenth of the old recipe.</p><p></p><p>The Body Tempering Liquid may be the lowest level of pills, but as of today, the spiritual Qi in this realm is becoming thinner and thinner. To us for whom expensive medicines and herbs are rare, this truly is a good thing. Medicine Master, continue to work hard. If you can improve pill recipes of level three and above, then your contributions and efforts will truly be invaluable.”</p><p></p><p>“To add-on: What’s most important is, the concocting difficulty has been greatly reduced, this can even be passed on to medicinal students to concoct.”</p><p></p><p>Seven Path’s Respected Sage was a famous senior in the group, and in terms of strength he was even one level higher than Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch. He also had high attainments in terms of pill concoction. In this group, he could be said to be the authority in terms of pill concocting, his praises naturally let a junior like Medicine Master feel extremely heartened.</p><p></p><p>“Thank you senior, I will work hard!” Medicine Master excitedly entered these many words in a single sentence, moreover with high speeds.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang’s mouth started twitching, there was actually someone who had already concocted and taken that ‘body tempering liquid’?  				</p>'),(14,2,'Chapter 4 H Citys 3rd stage  Houtian lightning tribulation',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 4: H City’s 3rd stage – Houtian lightning tribulation</p><p></p><p>Thinking it through, Song Shuhang pressed and held the ? key and deleted what he typed into the chat window.</p><p></p><p>He understood, with this group’s members’ temperament, even if he sent advice, he reckoned that none of them would probably listen. Moreover, since there was someone who had already taken it, and was still able to leap and frisk about, that medicine shouldn’t poison someone to death in a short period of time, right?</p><p></p><p>Although this was how it is, Song Shuhang felt that he couldn’t just leave them to their own devices. Every medicine had its side effects, perhaps this body tempering liquid or something was a slow acting poison, and wouldn’t kill a person in a short period of time, but if it took a life in a long period of time what was there to do?</p><p></p><p>Therefore this medicinal recipe had to be verified!</p><p></p><p>He was even still worried for this group of xianxia chuunibyous.</p><p></p><p>As a person, Song Shuhang was generally a great candidate to choose as a good friend.</p><p></p><p>He picked up the notebook beside him, then copied down the 30 and more medicinal ingredients that Medicine Master’s ‘body tempering fluid’ contained that could be found online.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang had an older female cousin named Zhao Yaya, who studied medical science.</p><p></p><p>Her university had a Chinese medicine faculty, so Song Shuhang wanted to have her ask them, if these 30 and more improving qi and blood circulation ingredients were thrown into a pot and cooked for a while, will the end result be able to kill the one who eats it?</p><p></p><p>All these improving blood circulation, qi and health ingredients, theoretically shouldn’t kill the one who eats it. But so many things stuffed into a pot to cook and stew, who knows what kind of thing it would end up transforming into at the end?</p><p></p><p>As for those names at the back, the Fresh Tyrant Branches, Nine-Yang Scarlet Bamboo slices etc. Those carried a clear sense of chunni, therefore Song Shuhang naturally chose to ignore them. Who knew what kind of things these were? He wasn’t someone stuck in second grade, alright?</p><p></p><p>If he took these items to ask his cousin, his cousin would definitely think that water had entered his brain. And then the next day, Mama Song would certainly board an aeroplane to hurry towards Jiang Nan City and take him to see some neurosurgeon or psychiatrist.</p><p></p><p>“When I go back home in another two weeks, I’ll secretly ask my cousin…” Song Shuhang quietly reasoned in his heart. He hoped that in this span of time, the xianxia aficionados wouldn’t cut him off.</p><p></p><p>While Song Shuhang was copying the pill recipe, Nine Provinces (1) Group also remained peaceful temporarily. On normal days the number of members online always remained low, by the looks of it even chuunibyous have normal lives to lead?</p><p></p><p>That’s right, people living on this earth still had to eat, work, and take care of children. Perhaps within this group there were also students like him.</p><p></p><p>After copying the 30 and more ingredients from the pill recipe, Song Shuhang stretched his back. He then looked towards the bottom right hand of his monitor, at the weather forecast software.</p><p></p><p>1st June, clear.</p><p></p><p>2nd June, clear.</p><p></p><p>“The weather’s good, I should go exercise for a bit later.” Song Shuhang felt that his physique had deteriorated, and so decided to do more exercise.</p><p></p><p>But it didn’t matter what his heart thought, for his fingers couldn’t help but open the computer’s game icon, first enjoy a game then think about it!</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>Although he said he’d enjoy a game, once the game started, one match after another, he simply couldn’t stop!</p><p></p><p>Unwittingly, it was afternoon.</p><p></p><p>“Time during weekends always seem to pass particularly fast.” Song Shuhang made a dry laugh, closed the game, then conveniently opened up the Nine Provinces (1) Group by habit.</p><p></p><p>Taking a look after booting, taking a look before shutting down, and a happy mood for the whole day!</p><p></p><p>Once the chat window opened, he realized that the frequently online North River’s Loose Practitioner was already online.</p><p></p><p>Inside there were many new chat records.</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner: “Medicine Master bro, your pill concocting standards leave me speechless. I tried 10 furnaces of that altered body tempering liquid, and even managed success with 8 of them, the medicine’s effectiveness was better than expected. It’s a pity that this body tempering liquid is only effective for entry-level cultivators. For a loose practitioner like me this isn’t very useful, but for those like Daluo Sect’s Rainmoon True Monarch and the others’ disciples and disciples’ children, those seniors would have great use for it. Once senior Rain Butterfly and the others receive this pill recipe, they would owe you, Medicine Master bro, a huge favor.”</p><p></p><p>Roaming Cloud Monk Tong Xuan mysteriously appeared, and sent a thumbs up.</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner immediately laughed, “I forgot, Master Tong Xuan you have a group of little monks under your care. Medicine Master bro, seems like the people who owe you a favor has once again increased.”</p><p></p><p>Roaming Cloud Monk Tong Xuan once again sent a smiley, then lurked.</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner returned with another smiley, he felt that practising that ‘silent meditation’ was a real pain in the ass, and if it wasn’t for the chat software allowing Master Tong Xuan to send punctuations and emoticons, he probably wouldn’t even have a way to socialize, right? Buddhist sects were just such a pain in the ass, which was why that time, when a great monk tried to sway him into becoming a novice monk, him not agreeing was a decision that couldn’t be greater!</p><p></p><p>Approximately 10 minutes later, Mad Saber Three Waves came online, “Soft Feather Fairy ~~ Soft Feather Fairy, if you are here please be sure to reply to this majesty for a moment!”</p><p></p><p>At the same time he sent a line of crying and kneeling emoticons.</p><p></p><p>“Oh, fellow daoist Three Waves hasn’t been online for the past few days, where did you go for closed-door cultivation?” North River’s Loose Practitioner made a naughty smile, he was asking despite knowing the circumstances.</p><p></p><p>“Closed a damned door!” Three Waves sent a voice message, even his voice sounded like choking: “Three days ago, ‘senior’ Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage came to visit this majesty, then stayed in this majesty’s house for three days. After that, you all know what happened ah ah ah ah……”</p><p></p><p>“Hehe.” North River’s Loose Practitioner expressed how he definitely wouldn’t pity Three Waves, someone who seeks death is not worth pitying!</p><p></p><p>“Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather, beautiful Soft Feather Fairy, please come out to meet Waves! I have something to request!” Three Waves miserably called, Waves was Three Waves’ surname. His original name was Waves Three.</p><p></p><p>“?” Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather came online, and sent a question mark.</p><p></p><p>“Fairy, you are finally here. This majesty has a request. I’m requesting you to please bring that overly-attached-to-his-daughter’s-relationships father back home. Waves is kneeling!” Three Waves sent a otz kneeling emoticon.</p><p></p><p>“Hehe.” Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather sent a smiley, and then sent another sentence after a moment, “Old me is overly attached to his daughter’s relationships?”</p><p></p><p>Huh? Wait a moment, doesn’t something seem to be wrong?</p><p></p><p>Old me? Oh my mama, it was Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage using his daughter’s account again?</p><p></p><p>Clunk, did something break? It was Three Waves’ frail heart.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, this old fella was overly attached to his daughter’s relationships, often using his daughter’s account, was there still justice in this world!?</p><p></p><p>“…….” North River’s Loose Practitioner felt that his mouth could no longer stop twitching. In the end, he kindly prompted, “Right, Three Waves bro. Lady Soft Feather seems to be refining the new version of body tempering liquid right?”</p><p></p><p>Which is why Lady Soft Feather will not come online for a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, there no longer was an afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Mad Saber Three Waves disconnected…… It was a disconnection, not that he went offline.</p><p></p><p>“Chi!” Song Shuhang happily laughed out.</p><p></p><p>Cheerful mood.</p><p></p><p>Over the 10 days of reading the chat records, he felt that the people in the group weren’t like normal chuunibyou patients. Their conversations revealed contents were too real, like it wasn’t products of their imaginations.</p><p></p><p>This thought only stayed in Song Shuhang’s mind for a moment before it passed.</p><p></p><p>“Could it be that I’ve seen too much of their chat records, and have been assimilated by them?” Thinking of this, Song Shuhang was frightened to the point he had cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>He had long passed the age for chuuni, but who doesn’t have a ‘remember that time’ moments?</p><p></p><p>Those years of heroic, wuxia and superhero dreams were his dark history, and experiences he wouldn’t want to face in this lifetime. Once he thought of it he would feel ashamed, and feel like dying; wanting to forget and wanting to forget!</p><p></p><p>So he absolutely must not be assimilated by the other fellas in the group.</p><p></p><p>“Time to go eat.” He extended his hand, and was about to close the Nine Provinces (1) Group.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to close the chat, the group’s North River’s Loose Practitioner once again appeared with a line, “Ah Qi, has the junior in your family finished with his tribulation? Why is there no noise from him?</p><p></p><p>Su Clan’s Ah Qi replied, “Preparing for it right now, it’s about to begin in a few hours.”</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner replied with another question, “Going through the tribulation from where? Do you need help?”</p><p></p><p>“The tribulation will be at a suburb of H city, don’t worry, my family’s Ah Shiliu has outstanding talent, a mere 3rd stage – Houtian advancement’s lightning calamity is a small matter, sprinkle a little water and it’s enough to pass. You guys can wait for my family’s Ah Shiliu to advance towards 4th stage – Xiantian, then he will come challenge you guys, wahaha!” Su Clan’s Ah Qi laughed, he was very relaxed.</p><p>[TL: Ah Qi’s Qi is the character seven, while Ah Shiliu’s Shiliu refers to sixteen. I might change to the actual numbers if more and more Ahs appear]</p><p></p><p>“If you put it that way then I’m relieved, Ah Shiliu this little fella’s talent is indeed pretty good. 3rd stage – Houtian should pose no problems for this little fella.” North River’s Loose Practitioner replied.</p><p></p><p>After this, the group’s peace was restored.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang rubbed his chin, H City?</p><p></p><p>Wasn’t that the place right beside the Jiang Nan region! Bringing that up, the university city he was at was right beside Jiang Nan City and H City, the J City’s district.</p><p></p><p>H City was a small city in Huaxia, and while the area was small, their economy was doing extremely well. It was Huaxia’s famed shopping heaven, with the reputation of having everything within heaven and earth up for sale. Of course, illegal things were excluded.</p><p></p><p>If the tribulation is received in H City, then can it be seen from the Jiang Nan region?</p><p></p><p>“Am I an idiot?” Song Shuhang laughed, how could he take things said by the group seriously?</p><p></p><p>A lightning calamity nonetheless? With this weather there are no clouds within 10000 miles, with bright and beautiful sunshine. It couldn’t be possible to have a thunderstorm right?</p><p></p><p>What’s more, the present is unlike a few years prior, the weather forecast is now accurate, at least within the approaching three days. If it was reported to be a sunny day, there wouldn’t be waves of thunder or torrential rains.</p><p></p><p>“Taking advantage of the good weather, I’ll go to the bookshop after eating!” Song Shuhang murmured.  				</p>'),(15,2,'Chapter 5 I Believe In Science',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 5: I Believe In Science!</p><p></p><p>After finishing his lunch, Song Shuhang walked towards the nearby book renting store to window read.</p><p>[TL: Basically he goes to the book shop to read but not to buy, similar to window shopping, and so, window read]</p><p></p><p>He liked to window read, not because he wanted to save the money of borrowing a few books, but this was his hobby. Song Shuhang found crouching at a corner of the book shop reading to be incredibly pleasurable!</p><p></p><p>Of course, in order to avoid the boss from hating him, after reading a while, he would rent a book or two. A person must have integrity, and anything done must not be too extreme, things must be worked on little by little! This way he can avoid the boss hating him, and chasing him out.</p><p></p><p>After all, for a book shop as large as the one in front of him, with a large variety of books not just limited to novels, rather all kinds of genres novels were available. This type of book shop was a rare nowadays.</p><p></p><p>To be put on a blacklist, in the vicinity around JiangNan University, one could not find a more impressive bookstore.</p><p></p><p>They say that a person’s name is important and the person becomes like their name. Song Shuhang really liked reading books, and had no bias against them.</p><p>[TL: The word ‘Shu’ in Song Shuhang means books, while ‘hang’ refers to boat/vessel/ship.]</p><p></p><p>No matter if they were fiction novels, classic literature, classical works, or even works on theories that can make a person’s head spin, he enjoyed all of them.</p><p></p><p>These days, he had been reading books on car driving techniques and important knowledge. He plans to obtain a driver’s license while classes are still easy during his first year. Taking the test at school rather than outside was a lot cheaper, a difference of 7 to 8 thousand yuan.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>While window reading, time would always fly by quickly.</p><p></p><p>In a blink of an eye, the time reached 3PM.</p><p></p><p>“So fast…..I need to prepare to go back already. I also need to go to the nearby supermarket to get some snacks for a midnight supper, so I can pull an all nighter on Saturday night.” Song Shuhang laughed.</p><p></p><p>Done muttering, he randomly chose a book, walked towards the checkout counter, and checked that book out.</p><p></p><p>The checkout counter was located at the exit of the bookstore. Today, the awning outside which provided shade for the store was broken, so the lady boss took refuge in a shaded spot, avoiding the scorching sun.</p><p></p><p>“The sun is so bright, it already feels like midsummer.” Song Shuhang said as he used one hand to cover his eyes and looked at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The lady boss was a classic Jiang Nan beauty, as if she was made of water.</p><p></p><p>Like Song Shuhang, her interest was also getting a book and reading it all day. From her attire, it could be seen that her quality of life wasn’t low and opening this bookstore was merely a hobby for her.</p><p></p><p>Normally, she would be sitting down and reading in a gentle and refined manner. Simply picturesque, the sight of this was warming to the heart and pleasing to the eyes. To watch this scene of the painting-like beauty, many youngsters would forcefully change their hobbies from being rebellious youths to literature youths.</p><p></p><p>However, it was said that this picturesque beauty side was just her peaceful side.</p><p></p><p>With a peaceful mode, there would certainly be a PK mode or berserk mode in her. Only, in this half-year, Shuhang had not seen this side.</p><p></p><p>“Alright. Within 2 days, you must remember to return it. An additional day will add another yuan towards the fee.” The lady boss completed the procedures for renting books, then waved her hand to signal Song Shuhang to get lost.</p><p></p><p>Although they had only interacted for half a semester, this moocher that would stay for more than half a day left a profound impression on her. If it wasn’t for his tact in checking out a few books to help her business, she would’ve used a broom and drove him out ages ago.</p><p></p><p>“Hehe” Song Shuhang laughed as he took the books and took a step exiting the store.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an ear-splitting sound exploded out.</p><p></p><p>This noise had scared everyone in this store, and regarding Song Shuhang who had almost taken a step out of the store, he fell flat on his face!</p><p></p><p>”Fuck!”</p><p></p><p>“Hey, what the hell!”</p><p></p><p>“Thunder from a clear sky?”</p><p></p><p>“Scared me to death.” In this bookstore, all sorts of exclamations could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Raising his head towards the sky, Song Shuhang found that the endlessly clear sky had changed. In the horizon, there appeared a black cloud quietly condensing. In a blink of an eye, the cloud covered the horizon, giving the feeling of storm clouds approaching.</p><p>[TL: Bad omens]</p><p></p><p>“It seems like it’s about to rain?” Tch tch. They said that a few years ago, weather forecasts were inaccurate and we must do the opposite. When the forecast states it will be a clear day, you need to bring an umbrella. I expected that after all these years, the weather forecast would’ve improved. To think that it would still be this unreliable.” Song Shuhang sighed.</p><p></p><p>It would be better if it was back then. Back then, you just needed to follow the opposite of what the forecast predicted. Currently, you need to predict and gamble whether the forecast is accurate.</p><p></p><p>After letting his imaginations run wild, he grasped his rented books and prepared the race back to the dorms while the rain hadn’t fallen yet.</p><p></p><p>Not waiting till Song Shuhang’s second foot stepped out.</p><p></p><p>Boom…..</p><p></p><p>Yet another thunder roared out, making the people’s ears buzz.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang’s raised leg once again returned back to the ground.</p><p></p><p>In the horizon, the area with the black cloud started to distort in a peculiar manner. Lightning in the shape of snakes began shooting out from the cloud, forming a “net” of lightning and exploding with rumbles.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang had seen lightning before, but in this lifetime, he had not seen thunder and lighting this concentrated—-almost as if it was the apocalypse. The thunder and lightning didn’t strike one by one, but rather struck in a coordinated manner.</p><p></p><p>The boom from the thunder was also not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the thunder would only have a loud boom with some reverberations afterwards. But right now, it sounded just like when a huge amount of gunpowder was added into firecrackers.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom, bang bang, boom boom.</p><p></p><p>With so much noise, even the echos were blocked out.</p><p></p><p>Supposing someone got struck by this, how much power would that guy unlock?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what made Song Shuhang even more apprehensive was that the black cloud did not move. It stayed at the horizon, chaotically bombing that area, without the intention of spreading over.</p><p></p><p>The cries of thunder surged on for about ten breaths, continuously.</p><p></p><p>This gave people a feeling that a fierce storm was approaching.</p><p></p><p>“How unfortunate!” Song Shuhang sighed. He spoke in his heart, “Why not I return to window read some more?”</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, regarding thunderstorms, those that arrived quickly, departed quickly as well. However, if the storm lasts longer, couldn’t he read another book?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he once again returned to the bookstore preparing to once again stay for a while.</p><p></p><p>As if God was playing a joke on Shuhang, upon turning around return to the bookstore, the rumbling seemed to have suddenly stopped!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the black cloud covering the horizon and the lightning shaped like snakes also vanished into thin air! It was as if a mighty hand was using the sky to paint, and upon becoming dissatisfied, he effortlessly erased the black clouds and lightning snakes.</p><p></p><p>Once again, the sky turned back to endlessly clear, the sun shined over everything! Similar to the recently occurring blasts from the thunder, the sky full of lightning snakes seemed like an illusion and simply fantasy.</p><p></p><p>In the store, there were people muttering, “What kind of situation is this?”</p><p></p><p>“There can’t actually be someone who sinned so much that they got struck by lightning, right?”</p><p></p><p>“Superstition! This thunder and lightning is merely a natural phenomenon…..”</p><p></p><p>At this time, next to Shuhang, a brat raised his head, his left hand clenching a kids manhua, his right pointing to the sky. Loudly, with an air of heroism, he yelled, “Ahh, I want this sky, to never again cover my eyes. I want this ground, unable to bury my heart! I want the sky covered in black clouds, to disappear without a trace!”</p><p></p><p>The corners of Song Shuhang’s mouth twitched, certain that once this brat grows up, upon recalling back this memory, he would be rolling on the ground in shame. Moreover, this type of dark history will haunt this brat for his whole life. After that, with great difficulty towards forgetting this memory, he couldn’t say for sure it would not appear from a nook in his brain, prompting him to yell: “Drop dead, so shameful!” and so on. Also making him wish that he could go back in time, and beat himself up.</p><p></p><p>Because he himself had tons of experience.</p><p></p><p>Only not knowing why, seeing this laughable brat, Song Shuhang suddenly thought of the Nine Provinces (1) Group and all the chuunibyou in it.</p><p></p><p>“H City, 3rd Stage-Houtian Tribulation.”</p><p></p><p>The chat record of the group flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>He once again assessed the location of the event. Just a moment ago, the area where the thunderstorm took place, seemed…..to be right at H City’s location?</p><p></p><p>Even though Song Shuhang had a big heart, his heart skipped a beat</p><p></p><p>Could it be? It was true?</p><p></p><p>The weather forecast displayed clear skies, but before his eyes, countless explosions from thunder had suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>“Hahahaha, how could this be possible! How could there be stuff capable of moving the heavens. It should be coincidence?!” Song Shuhang calmed his heart down.</p><p></p><p>But, when the thought arose, it was impossible to get rid of it. Were there really such coincidences in this world? Those lightning snakes were extremely strange, as if they weren’t natural.</p><p></p><p>H City, Tribulation. These few words unceasingly resounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Forcefully, Song Shuhang shook his head, throwing this possibility out of his mind.</p><p></p><p>This worldview, that he had used 18 years to construct, told him to believe in science and refuse superstition. Those thunderclouds were only a strange natural phenomenon and were not from the tribulation!  				</p>'),(16,2,'Chapter 6 Copper Trigrams Immortal Master',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 6: Copper Trigram’s Immortal Master</p><p></p><p>“I have been infected by the people in the chat group.  Although reading the chat records is pretty fun, as expected, I should leave the group after a while. Or else, if time passes, I will become one of them——I’ll let my cousin look at this recipe, determine whether or not these ingredients will cause death if eaten, then leave the group.” Song Shuhang affirmed internally.</p><p></p><p>Actually, since this was just a mysterious group…and since he was mysteriously added, Song Shuhang could completely ignore whether the other party would live or die.</p><p></p><p>However, he always felt that if the “medicinal pill” had poison in it, then nevertheless, he should warn and advise them against consuming it. Even if the other party doesn’t heed his words, he would at least have a clear conscience.</p><p></p><p>Yes, a clear conscience.</p><p></p><p>Whether they listen or not was the group members’ responsibility, but whether to advise them or not…that was his responsibility.</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving at the dorms, Song Shuhang opened the chat application and sent his cousin, Zhao Yaya, a copy of the medicinal ingredients.</p><p></p><p>“Sis Yaya, hypothetically, if you took all the ingredients, boiled them all down into paste, will the finished product kill someone upon consumption? If you have time, please help me find out.”</p><p></p><p>Upon hitting the enter key and sending the message, Song Shuhang leaned back on his chair, relaxing his mind.</p><p></p><p>Cousin Zhou Yaya and Song Shuhang were not close. She had already started interning at college, and did not come online that often. A lot of times, she would only pop online once in a few days. Upon sending a message, it would be normal to receive a reply after a week.</p><p></p><p>If he could, Song Shuhang would rather not have asked this question over the internet.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were some things better said face to face to prevent any misunderstandings. If his cousin thought he was the one who wanted to eat this, then wouldn’t this be unexplainable without meeting face to face? He was afraid that his dearest mother would fly all the way over to see him.</p><p></p><p>However today, he felt himself becoming increasingly like one of the group members—Indeed, reading this chat log was interesting, but it would be better for him to leave earlier.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the fact that he had never popped up in the chat, and he had not interacted with any of the members, his exit from the group wouldn’t have that much impact.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, his fingers involuntarily shifted to the bottom right corner, and opened up the Nine Provinces (1) Group.</p><p></p><p>It was really easy to form a habit. As a matter of fact, it only took him ten days to form the habit of checking this chat group daily.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were some people online.</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner: “Ah Qi, is the tribulation over? Has little Shiliu advanced in rank?”</p><p></p><p>This message was sent just over 10 minutes ago, but Su Clan’s Ah Qi had not yet responded to him.</p><p></p><p>“Something couldn’t have happened during the tribulation right?” Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather asked. This time, it was actually she herself and not her father. This girl may have had just joined this group, but with her glib tongue, she had already become familiar with some of the more active group members.</p><p></p><p>She knew that for cultivators, every single tribulation could not be underestimated. No matter how weak the tribulation was, just a single mistake could cause serious repercussions.</p><p></p><p>“That shouldn’t be the case, there’s Ah Qi there. It’s merely 3rd Stage- Houtian tribulation, if there were to be a problem, he could forcefully dispel it.” North River’s Loose Practitioner responded.</p><p></p><p>Only, Su Clan’s Ah Qi never responded, and he couldn’t put himself at ease.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an ID that Song Shuhang had never seen emerged. This person was called ‘Copper Trigram’s Immortal Master’. He sent: “You guys need not worry yet. Wait for this Immortal Master to divinate first, then you’ll know the result.”</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, North River’s Loose Practitioner replied: “Ok.”</p><p></p><p>It looked like this person called Copper Trigram’s Immortal Master played the role of an Immortal Master in terms of divination?</p><p></p><p>After about two or three minutes, Copper Trigram’s Immortal Master said: “Haha, no problem. The results from my divination shows a very auspicious outcome,  Su Clan’s Ah Qi and his younger relative should be fine. Let’s just wait for little Shiliu to come challenge us.”</p><p></p><p>Very auspicious, then they should be relieved now, right? Even though you can’t take fortune telling as truth, but sometimes it certainly can make you feel better. Shuhang thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, after North River’s Loose Practitioner heard the divination result, he wasn’t delighted. Instead, he became quiet.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he sent an  grimacing emoji and said, “It seems that Ah Shiliu is indeed in trouble, which is why Ah Qi is not online. Is there anybody who is in H City’s vicinity that can go check if Ah Qi needs any help?”</p><p></p><p>Mad Saber Three Waves appeared, and sighed: “If the result of the Trigram Immortal is very auspicious, then something is wrong. But I am very far away from H city. Even if I rushed there, it will take me days to get there.”</p><p></p><p>“?” Soft Feather was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>“Soft Feather, what you don’t know is that Immortal Master’s divination is never correct. If the result from his divination is very auspicious, then you’d better be prepared, because a calamity is imminent. On the other hand, if he divines that you will be in grave danger, you should feel relief, because your luck has just turned great. If one day he foresees that the most world-breaking tribulation is coming your way, then you should have a celebratory party, because this is a sign that you might pick up an immortal tool just from leaving home!” Mad Saber Three Waves explained.</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner added: “From a different perspective, Trigram Immortal’s divination ability is indeed strong, because if you take the opposite of his divinations, you have basically found correct the correct answer.”</p><p></p><p>Copper Trigram’s Immortal Master, “……”</p><p></p><p>He felt a strong urge to scream and defend himself, but because of his long and dark track record, he felt stifled to death.</p><p></p><p>“Oh, right, lady Soft Feather, could you ask your father when he plans to return home? He has been staying at my place for a long time. Doesn’t he miss his home, doesn’t he miss his adorable and beautiful daughter?” Mad Saber Three Waver learned his lesson this time and didn’t say anything that would warrant his death</p><p></p><p>“Sure thing senior, I will ask my dad when I have time.” Soft Feather responded politely,  but her response was vague as she didn’t say when she would ask, and also didn’t confirm that the question she will ask her father is for him to return home.</p><p></p><p>Mad Saber Three Waves is quite astute, and he realized that Soft Feather was merely throwing him off. As a result, brother Three Waves’ eyes once again moistened.</p><p></p><p>“Is there any lurker here from H City?” North River’s Loose Practitioner asked the entire group.</p><p></p><p>The lurking group members popped out one by one, but all denied being in H city. Huaxia was a huge country, while there were only that many people in the group. It’s impossible for everybody to be in the same area.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang was in JiangNan region right next to H city, but he was no acquaintance of Su Clan’s Ah Qi. Moreover, he still kept a clear head, it would be impossible for him to assist these folks in the group to go searching for someone who allegedly went missing after a lightning tribulation based on someone’s divination.</p><p></p><p>He had not been assimilated afterall.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Spirit Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather said again: “I plan to run some errands in J city, I will fly to Jiang Nan airport first, then transfer to J city. Jiang Nan region is close to H city, if there is anything I can help with, please contact me anytime. Even though I am not familiar with H city, I will do my best to help.”</p><p></p><p>“That is great.” North River’s Loose Practitioner responded.</p><p></p><p>“Passing by Jiang Nan region? This lady from the chat group is coming here?” Song Shuhang blinked a few times.</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner gladly said: “I will try to contact Ah Qi. If he needs help, I will then reach out to you, Soft Feather.”</p><p></p><p>He and Su Clan’s Ah Qi had been great friends even before joining this chat group. Now, with Copper Trigram’s Immortal Master’s divination, North River’s Loose Practitioner became very concerned.</p><p></p><p>If something does not concern you, then it doesn’t matter. If something does concern you, you can’t stay calm .</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch appeared. The moderator of the chat group tried to console him by saying: “North River, don’t get overly worried. With Ah Qi present, don’t even mention the 3rd Stage-Houtian tribulation, even if it was the 4th Stage-Xiantian tribulation, it couldn’t possibly do a thing to him.”</p><p></p><p>“That’s true.” North River’s Loose Practitioner sighed. “Actually I wasn’t worried at first. It was merely a 3rd Stage-Houtian tribulation afterall. However, the very auspicious divination made by Copper Trigram’s Immortal Master truly made me endlessly worried.”</p><p></p><p>“….” Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch.</p><p></p><p>“……” Mad Saber Three Waves.</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner words made a lot of sense, and the two of them were left speechless.  				</p>'),(17,2,'Chapter 7 The Group Of Delinquents That Got Wiped Out',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 7: The Group Of Delinquents That Got Wiped Out</p><p></p><p>Copper Trigram’s Immortal Master, “Damn! North River’s Loose Practitioner what do you mean by that, this is intolerable bullying! On next month’s full moon night, at the Forbidden Purple Peak, do you dare to come?”</p><p></p><p>“Sure, do you think I’m scared of you, a fake divination master? However, I’m not free on next month’s full moon, how about we set the date as three months later?” North River’s Loose Practitioner refreshingly agreed, “Also, when the time comes how am I supposed to find you? After all you have too many identities. If you turn into a sockpuppet, I wouldn’t recognize you even if you stood in front of my eyes.”</p><p></p><p>Copper Trigram’s Immortal Master was not just ‘proficient’ in divination, he was also a master in changing appearance. The people in the chat group guessed that he must have been chased around to be killed for calculating divinations wrongly so often, and had no choice but to change his identity to flee. Over time, he mastered the art of changing appearances.</p><p></p><p>“Three months it is then! When the time comes all you need to care about is going up the Forbidden Purple Peak, I will find you there! Your hateful face, I would recognize it even if it turned into ashes!” Copper Trigram’s Immortal Master angrily said.</p><p></p><p>“This is settled then!” North River’s Loose Practitioner was very resolute, as if he had Copper Trigram’s Immortal Master in the bag.</p><p></p><p>When Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch saw this, he sent a smiley and said, “North River, it seems like you’re about to have a breakthrough. You want a fight to draw it out, and breakthrough in one breath right? You have been stuck in the 5th Stage – Spirit Emperor for a long time, it’s indeed about time you made a breakthrough. Three months later during the night of the full moon, if I am able to spare some time to come out, I will go to the Forbidden Purple Peak to referee you two’s duel. When the time comes, I will also prepare a small gift for the two of you.</p><p></p><p>“True Monarch truly understands me!” North River’s Loose Practitioner immediately became excited, it must be known that Mt. Yellow’s True Monarch was an old senior, something he prepared definitely would not be something as simple as a ‘small gift.’</p><p></p><p>To procure such things from the fingertips of these old seniors, these things can be considered to be treasures for juniors like them, treasures that they could only get through fortuitous encounters!</p><p></p><p>“Since True Monarch has said that, when the time comes I won’t leave North River out cold. I originally intended to let North River endure half a night of cold wind on the Forbidden Purple Peak first.” said Copper Trigram’s Immortal Master slowly.</p><p></p><p>“……” North River’s Loose Practitioner.</p><p></p><p>What an asshole!</p><p></p><p>This fella deserves to be called someone whose divination toys with a person’s heart, his heart is really tainted!</p><p></p><p>At this time North River secretly decided in his heart, three months later he absolutely has to beat up Copper Trigram’s Immortal Master so badly that even True Monarch can’t recognize him!</p><p></p><p>As this matter came to a conclusion, the chat group temporarily turned silent.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>After Song Shuhang read the chat records, he was a little worried in his heart: It can’t be that the Copper Trigram’s Immortal Master and North River’s Loose Practitioner from the group would really go to the Forbidden City’s Forbidden Purple Peak for a duel, right? Based on their character it’s possible that they might actually do such silly things, when that happens what if they get caught by the security there?</p><p></p><p>I shall note this down first, when leaving the group I must warn them not to damage our country’s cultural heritage, that is illegal.</p><p></p><p>Closing the chat group, Song Shuhang opened the Jiang Nan regional University’s web page, to see what news there is today.</p><p></p><p>The lead story of the school’s webpage was this afternoon’s mysterious wild lightning, the location of the lightning was as Song Shuhang had guessed, at H City.</p><p></p><p>Because of that thunderstorm within the clear skies, H City and the nearby Jiang Nan region had areas which experienced a blackout. This caused a chain of problems, but luckily, there were no mortalities.</p><p></p><p>At the end there were bits and pieces of news regarding Jiang Nan University City. Some examples are, the renewal of their school beauties and handsome men rankings, which of the school’s graduates had started up a company that was renown throughout the country, the result of the school’s national ranking in competitions, the price of the blanket used by senior female graduates in auctions, etc.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang was not interested in these, he just needed to gain knowledge of some of them, so that when necessary, he possesses some shared conversation topics when idly chatting with others.</p><p></p><p>After that, he started searching for information regarding registration to learn driving on the school’s website. The registration fee for ordinary cars was 2500, student price was just that advantageous. In Jiang Nan region, the moment a student steps out of the school, the costs of learning to drive would start from 10000 and above.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang took note of the contact number, he intended to learn the theory within the next few days, then register for driving classes. The driving school had classes for theory, but if he studied the theory himself and directly applied for practical driving classes it would be quicker.</p><p></p><p>Ding Dong~</p><p></p><p>On the school website there was a new update regarding the campus, arousing curiosity from him.</p><p></p><p>Just about 10 to 20 minutes ago, in the alleys close to the University City, many delinquents were knocked unconscious by a mysterious expert, the whole group was wiped out.</p><p></p><p>These so-called delinquents are actually mostly students, while a minority were students that dropped out. A large number of them had very gaudy hairdos, with piercings all over their bodies, and secretly dodged from the teachers in a small alley to smoke, they are rebellious youths.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there would also be repeater students, with the hobby of ‘borrowing’ money from cowardly students. To the delinquents, to gang beat down others is a type of interest, while it is also nothing out of the ordinary for someone to get beat down. This is because those who don’t have a gang or faction, can’t even be considered as hoodlums.</p><p></p><p>Delinquents getting beat up wasn’t news, but within a mere few minutes, having about a 100 of these delinquents beat up was the issue.</p><p></p><p>On the photos taken by students at the scene, the miserable conditions of the delinquents could be seen. Every single one of them had ridiculously red faces, the appearance of their faces were as if they were going to act in a Beijing opera, with bruises of various colors. They perfectly suit that saying——already beat up to the point that even their mothers can’t recognize them!</p><p></p><p>The school web had many comments regarding this.</p><p></p><p>There was someone rejoicing in those people’s misfortune: “Who did it? They really did not show mercy. Was it the MMA club or the Taekwondo club? Or could it be that someone from the Boxing club trained new members, and formed a group to wipe out the delinquents?”</p><p></p><p>The one that reports new information: “All of them were knocked unconscious, they are now on the way to the hospital. No one has awoken yet, the suspect is unknown.”</p><p></p><p>The one that speculates: “According to the people from the shophouse beside the alley, they did not see big group of delinquents fighting amongst themselves. Moreover even if they fought amongst themselves, it can’t be that not a single one is conscious, right? There can’t be such a coincidence even if it was mutual destruction. Therefore it is highly likely that it was an expert at work, a single person or several people had wiped up all of the delinquents.”</p><p></p><p>“Master? The type that can beat up more than 80 alone? Haha.” Someone laughed, one must know that even if the number of delinquents didn’t number up to a 100, there would still be at least 80. With so many delinquents beaten into the ground in a short few minutes, only those great heroes from the movies that crossed over can do that, right?</p><p></p><p>“Perhaps it is a person in the elite special forces of the army that did this? It is said that those elite special forces handle ordinary people like handling toys, they can handle a dozen or more in a minute.”</p><p></p><p>“This guy upstairs is here to joke right? Even if elite special forces are so awesome, they also have their own missions. Having them ordered to deal with these delinquents, that is the same as using a cannon to shoot a mosquito!”</p><p></p><p>“Please stop speculating, wouldn’t we know who did this once the delinquents wake up?” Someone replied.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang refreshed the webpage, casually looked at the various comments then closed the news window.</p><p></p><p>In any case, things that happened to the delinquents were of no concern to him.</p><p></p><p>Despite being only 1.75m tall, Song Shuhang was very buff. With one glance it was obvious that he wasn’t the type that would become the target for ‘borrowing’ money, it was like he and the delinquents lived in separate worlds…… If nothing unexpected happens, there will never be a relationship between him and those delinquents for his entire lifetime.</p><p></p><p>After doing a lazy stretch, he closed the campus webpage, leaned against his chair and emptied his mind.</p><p></p><p>The weird thunderstorm in the morning kept resounding in his mind, the mind that was obviously emptied from time to time had lightning and thunder flashing past, causing his spirit to be unable to gain tranquillity for a long time.</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>2 June, Sunday, Clear weather.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang got off bed early, he originally intended to stay awake overnight, but the string of events yesterday kept making him feel strange. He had no idea why he lost the mood to stay awake overnight, and instead washed up to sleep early.</p><p></p><p>Even if he wanted to do it tonight, the other roommates from the dorm would have returned.</p><p></p><p>After getting up and washing up, Shuhang once again opened up the group chat software on the bottom right corner of the monitor. As before, elder cousin Zhao Yaya did not reply. It seems like he still has to wait for more 2 days.</p><p></p><p>“If after 2 days elder cousin does not reply, then I’ll give her a call.” Song Shuhang thought inside.</p><p></p><p>After that he once again opened up the Nine Provinces’ (1) Group. Every time he took a look, he would have a beautiful and great mood.</p><p></p><p>But if he sees too much, he would easily be assimilated.</p><p></p><p>The first piece of information in the group was from Su Clan’s Ah Qi: “I’ve let everybody worry, Ah Shiliu’s lightning tribulation had a little accident, however I have already settled it. After the accident in Ah Shiliu’s lightning tribulation, he vented his temper. However he was also found and brought away by me, and didn’t cause too great of a disturbance. It was right at a place close to H City, there were several…… Yep, there were dozens of tactless ordinary people knocked unconscious by Ah Shiliu, no one died. I still have to bring Ah Shiliu back for a trip to the Su Clan’s main branch next, I probably won’t be online for the next few days. Anyways…… Everybody, please don’t be worried.”</p><p></p><p>This was a message that was sent at 3AM that morning.  				</p>'),(18,2,'Chapter 8 Soft Feather and Luo Xin Street',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 8: Soft Feather and Luo Xin Street</p><p></p><p>“It’s good that nothing happened, I feel relieved now. I will inform Soft Feather, so that she won’t worry, and to avoid her wasting a trip towards H City.” North River’s Loose Practitioner entered a reply soon after.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang felt that North River’s Loose Practitioner was basically online for all 24 hours everyday, he did not know how this person had so much energy. Could it be that his online habits are coincidentally the same as himself, the one with the name Song? Which was why every time he came online he happens to encounter North River’s Loose Practitioner.</p><p></p><p>That’s not right…… When Song Shuhang was online, he was online. When Song Shuhang was offline, he was still online, because every time Song Shuhang came online the chat records he sees all had North River’s Loose Practitioner included inside it.</p><p></p><p>It was like he didn’t need sleep at all, as if he was a sacred warrior of the internet.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang couldn’t help but worry, because as of right now, the number of sudden deaths due to overnight computer usage are so high, if North River’s Loose Practitioner continues on like that will he someday die a sudden death too?</p><p></p><p>This shall be noted down as well…… When the time comes to leave the group I better advise him.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang continued to pull the scrollbar downwards.</p><p></p><p>After Su Clan’s Ah Qi was done talking, he greeted everybody once more, then went offline.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, at around 5AM in the morning, Medicine Master came online and uploaded a photo, then added a question mark after the photo.</p><p></p><p>That is a picture of a plant, one that Song Shuhang has never seen before.</p><p></p><p>This plant grew curved, like a coiling dragon. At the tip of the plant there was a line of thorns, while the rhizome was purplish black, it was a very peculiar plant, with many great points which were worth admiring.</p><p></p><p>“Poison Dragon Grass huh, Medicine Master do you have a need for this again? Didn’t you cultivated some not too long ago?” North River’s Loose Practitioner was once again the first to reply.</p><p></p><p>“Experiment, all died.” Medicine Master then sent a depressed emoji. Furthermore, that batch of Poison Dragon Grass’ quality wasn’t very good.</p><p></p><p>“Alright, I will contact you if I manage to get some. If the others see it they will definitely notify you as well.” North River’s Loose Practitioner replied.</p><p></p><p>“Want alive.” Medicine Master added one more reply.</p><p></p><p>Poison Dragon Grass…… From the sound of it, it doesn’t seem like a kind plant, it can’t be that it’s also for concocting pills, right? Will it poison someone to death?</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang was a little worried, he kept feeling that the people in the group were very good at seeking death.</p><p></p><p>Wait, there seems to be something fishy here.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang’s hand trembled for a moment, his fingers moved back a little, up to where Su Clan’s Ah Qi had replied, then looked at it one more time.</p><p></p><p>“There were several…… Yep, there were dozens of tactless ordinary people knocked unconscious by Ah Shiliu, no one died.”</p><p></p><p>This sentence gave Song Shuhang a weird feeling, because he automatically thought of the group of delinquents that were wiped out……</p><p></p><p>It can’t be such a coincidence right? If one were to say all of these were a coincidence, then the number of coincidences recently is a little too much isn’t it!?</p><p></p><p>“Perhaps I should look at it from a different perspective, perhaps it’s not a coincidence, it’s just me overthinking things.”</p><p></p><p>“People are always like that, when they have doubts towards a certain topic in their hearts, they bring many unrelated things together to forcibly form a conclusion. Just like when suspecting someone stole their money, they will link many events onto this person’s head, and the more they look at that person the more they think they are looking at a criminal.”</p><p></p><p>He felt that his current state of mind was perhaps the ‘suspecting someone is a thief’ mindset.</p><p></p><p>I can’t over think this anymore, if I continue to think about it I will go astray just like the people in the group. Song Shuhang did a lazy stretch, and prepared to go for a jog.</p><p></p><p>The time of the day lies in the morning, moreover he felt his physique decline, he hasn’t fully recovered from the flu and cough that has lasted for more than 10 days, and still coughs from time to time, it’s torture!</p><p></p><p>So he came up with an idea, and decided to run 1.5km in the morning to toughen his body.</p><p></p><p>The goal is to persevere morning jogs for a whole month!</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in Jiang Nan region’s airport.</p><p></p><p>A lady with waist-length hair walked out of the airport with a large suitcase. She had white skin, was tall, had long legs. She wore a white T-shirt, denim shorts, and a pair of sneakers for her slender feet, looking youthful and pretty.</p><p></p><p>However, at this time the long-haired lady had a vexed expression as she looked around the gigantic airport, “I dislike large places like this the most, it’s so easy to get lost.”</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, she took out her cellphone, and fiddled with it.</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>Sweating all over from his morning jog, Song Shuhang felt freshness and clarity, something he hasn’t felt for a long time.</p><p></p><p>When he passed by the dining hall he bought a steamed stuffed bun and soy milk as breakfast, and returned to the dormitory after his rapid and shallow breaths stabilized.</p><p></p><p>It’s Sunday and there’s still a whole day of free time left, what should I do?</p><p></p><p>Should I go window read?</p><p></p><p>Nibbling on the steamed stuffed bun, Song Shuhang thought inside.</p><p></p><p>He then casually turned on the computer, and got onto the school’s webpage. Because he cared about the matter regarding the delinquents being knocked unconscious, he continued to pay attention to it.</p><p></p><p>However, there wasn’t a following report regarding the delinquents wiped out on the school’s webpage, because the pitiful delinquents were still lying on the hospital beds, and not a single one had shown any signs of being about to gain consciousness yet.</p><p></p><p>Which was why there was no way to find out who or what beat them into such a state.</p><p></p><p>The students that previously visited them had brought this up before, even though they were unconscious, the delinquents would from time to time make moans from pain. Due to their numbers being so great, they were placed into an enormous ward by the hospital. An approximate of 80 people’s miserable shrieks, that scene was simply too beautiful, and extremely tragic.</p><p></p><p>“It it was only being knocked unconscious, they should wake up within a day or two, shouldn’t they? It can’t be that these delinquents have been beaten into vegetables, right?” Song Shuhang softly spoke to himself.</p><p></p><p>While letting his thoughts drift, he once again opened the chat group.</p><p></p><p>During the time he went for a jog and had breakfast, there was a lot more new information in the group.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather (Online via mobile): “Senior North River, I have already arrived at Jiang Nan region’s airport. Does senior Ah Qi’s side require any assistance?”</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner was expected, online. He rapidly replied, “Soft Feather, you’ve finally came online, Ah Qi had already found Ah Shiliu during the wee hours, and left H City. You need not worry about them, and can directly proceed to J City to deal with your matters at ease.</p><p></p><p>“If nothing bad happened then all is well.” Soft Feather replied, then added another line, “Has senior Ah Qi already left H City?”</p><p></p><p>“Yes, he left at dawn.” North River’s Loose Practitioner returned with another question, “Could it be that you need Ah Qi for something, Soft Feather?”</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather sighed, “Actually…… I was hoping to meet up with senior Ah Qi, if would be best if somebody accompanied me to J City if possible. I am not too familiar with H City, Jiang Nan region and J City, I’m afraid that I might not be able to find my destination.”</p><p></p><p>“Where are you going to? Right now cellphones have a function called navigation, it’s very useful. It must be said that the inventions by modern people have many convenient uses.” North River’s Loose Practitioner passionately recommended, many people in the group were unfamiliar with modern technology, North River’s Loose Practitioner could be considered as someone ‘modern’ here.</p><p></p><p>Hey, hello?

However, at that moment, he had the spirit to help but not the strength. Because University city was a 2 hour car ride from Jiang Nan airport. Jiang Nan region was a county after all, its territory wasn’t small.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Song Shuhang was unfamiliar with J City, and had never ever heard of that Ghost Lamp Temple before.</p><p></p><p>All he knew was that J City was adjacent to the Jiang Nan region, and was also a very well known city within Huaxia.</p><p></p><p>Because that place is also the holy site of various religion, the many religious people can cause eyes to blur. Every year, during the religion’s festivals, the number of believers who make a pilgrimage to J City is enough to cause it to be packed to the point where not even an ant can squeeze its way through.</p><p></p><p>There were as many temples there were hairs on an ox, trying to find a little temple in a city like that was truly difficult.</p><p></p><p>“Come to think of it, the name Luo Xin Street sounds really familiar, have I heard of it before?” Song Shuhang murmured.</p><p></p><p>Nibbling on his steamed stuffed bun, Song Shuhang leaned back on the rocking chair and swayed. Searching for the words ‘Luo Xin Street’ in his mind, he tried to draw out the source of this mysteriously familiar feeling.</p><p></p><p>Mankind’s brains have always been strange, some memories will surface whether the host wishes to or not, yet when the host tries to recalls that memory, they will not surface no matter how the host racks their brains trying to force it out.</p><p></p><p>“I probably heard this name from some news channel before, right?” Shuhang gave up, and no longer wasted his brain cells on this matter.</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather dragged the huge suitcase to the taxi stand.</p><p></p><p>In barely a moment, there were several taxis moving towards Soft Feather, this proved that a pretty face is advantageous in any situation. Otherwise, solely based on that huge suitcase, many taxi drivers would dispel their thoughts of picking up this passenger.</p><p></p><p>“Miss, where to?” A red taxi took up the first spot, the driver was a middle-aged man with a square face, speaking Mandarin with a heavy Jiang Nan region’s accent.</p><p></p><p>“Sir…… Do you know where Ghost Lamp Temple is?” Soft Feather asked, her voice was gentle, a stark difference from a youthful and lively appearance, but all these only made her all the more attractive.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man with a square face thought hard and bitterly, and shook his head, “Ghost Lamp Temple, I’ve never heard of it before.”</p><p></p><p>Seeing the middle-aged man with a square face shake his head, Soft Feather’s heart sunk, her little face was a little red, for she was extremely disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the middle-aged man with a square face immediately asked, “Do you know which street it is in?”</p><p></p><p>“I know, it’s Luo Xin Street!” Soft Feather replied at once.</p><p></p><p>“Luo Xin Street, I know of this place, and I’m very familiar with it, for I stay in that street. However Miss, are you sure you got the name of the temple right? I’ve stayed there for many years, and have never heard of this Ghost Lamp Temple before.” The middle-aged man with a square face seriously replied.</p><p></p><p>Because of his vocation, he had a thorough understanding of all of the nearby areas. He was especially familiar with Luo Xin Street where he stayed, to exaggerate a little, every inch of land had his footprint, yet he had never heard of the name Ghost Lamp Temple.</p><p></p><p>“Ah?” Soft Feather’s little face turned even redder, however she immediately replied with resolution, “Then Sir, please bring me to Luo Xin Street!”</p><p></p><p>She was prepared to go there and ask around, if it truly cannot be done…… Then she could only thicken her skin and call her dad. However, that is her final plan, and must not be used unless there truly is no alternative in sight.</p><p></p><p>“Miss, are you in a hurry? If you aren’t, you may take a bus to Luo Xin Street. Taking a taxi there would be a little expensive, for it’s a 2 hour drive.” The middle-aged man with a square face explained.</p><p></p><p>It wasn’t that he didn’t want to earn money, but the fee to take a 2 hour taxi ride truly wasn’t small. The other party obviously had no knowledge of the distance, if the distance and price wasn’t clearly mentioned before the journey, a dispute could easily occur after arriving at the destination.</p><p></p><p>“That’s alright, you only need to worry about bringing me there.” Soft Feather revealed a bashful smile, money wasn’t a problem for her at all.</p><p></p><p>When the middle-aged man with a square face confirmed this, he was delighted inside. The amount that would be earned in this trip was pretty significant.</p><p></p><p>“Alright then, you may enter the vehicle, the suitcase can be placed into the boot.” As he said that, the middle-aged man with a square face opened up the boot, then opened his door to prepare getting off and helping to lift the suitcase.</p><p></p><p>After all, that suitcase was very bulky, where would this young lady find the energy to lift it up?</p><p></p><p>However, when the middle-aged man with a square face opened his door and turned his head back, his mouth opened into the shape of an ‘O’ and couldn’t close for a long time.</p><p></p><p>What he saw was that the young lady who seemed weak and gentle lift up the huge suitcase with a single hand…… She did not drag it up, hug it up or whatever. It was like she was merely lifting a small plate as she dexterously lifted up the suitcase with a single hand, and placed it into the boot.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the suitcase looked big, but was actually very light?</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking of that, he felt the car’s rear slightly sink. The middle-aged man had been a taxi driver for many years, and had long achieved the stage of one with the car. Once the car’s rear sunk, he could roughly estimate the weight of the object.</p><p></p><p>This suitcase is probably over 60kg, right? Maybe even heavier, approximately the weight of an adult male.</p><p></p><p>Does this lady practice weight-lifting? This truly is some godly innate strength.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man with a square face swallowed his saliva. Fortunately, he was always a kind taxi driver, if it was someone with evil intent that schemed after seeing a beauty that met this lady, they would definitely brought down in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather didn’t know how shocking her actions were. After placing the suitcase in, she took two steps back to the car’s rear door and got in.</p><p></p><p>“Miss, you’re pretty strong, please sit tight.” The middle-aged man with a square face laughed and stepped on the accelerator.

With North River’s Loose Practitioner’s reply, her restless mood slightly calmed. To be honest, this was her first time travelling so far away from home alone.

This place is part of the Jiang Nan region.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Soft Feather remembered the wrong address?</p><p></p><p>Or could it be that J City and Jiang Nan region both have a Luo Xin Street?</p><p></p><p>This is normal, city and county names are rarely repeated, but village names, street names and so on are often repeated. The place Soft Feather wants to go must be the one in J City, and she should not be coming to Jiang Nan region.</p><p></p><p>Because he came out to relieve his boredom, Shuhang did not continue brooding over this.</p><p></p><p>He walked while eating, and ate while strolling.</p><p></p><p>He did not know how long he strolled for, but after he felt a little tired, he bought another 2 crispy chicken rolls, and sat on a bench provided for people to rest by the side of the road, and rested.</p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>Opposite the resting area was Luo Xin Street’s large public square, it had people walking in and out, and bustled with noise and excitement.</p><p></p><p>The weather just turned warm, but it can never stop women’s inborn love for beauty.</p><p></p><p>Everywhere had dazzling spaghetti tops, midriff tops, miniskirts, low-waist hot pants, heels and pointy-tipped sandals. Enchanting jade necks and cleavage, slim waists and jade legs, increasing the charm and loveliness of Luo Xin Street by a thousand times.</p><p></p><p>As long as one sat at the resting area, one could see the countless long legs sparkling with innumerable rays of light.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang casually chose the resting area, and it was a great place to spot beauties. By his side were 3 dudes grading the beauties’ legs.</p><p></p><p>“Did you guys see that? The red dress below the large electronic display on the left, that figure, those legs are at least 80 points.” The fat dude with thick glasses pointed at the red dress’ figure.</p><p></p><p>“Ah Xu, your insight still needs more practice. 73 marks is the highest, her legs are long, but as a whole entity she is a little too skinny. Moreover the proportion of the calf is somewhat short, affecting the entire package’s beauty.” Beside him a handsome man gave his professional opinion.</p><p></p><p>“Is that so?” Glasses fatty scratched his head, with a careful look it truly was as the handsome man said. However it would be impossible to tell if he did not look carefully.</p><p></p><p>“I think she can be 77 marks and above, after all in reality beautiful legs like this are already hard to come by. We can’t use the long leg celebrities or leg models as comparison.” The last, short-haired man leaned against the bench, and spoke lazily.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang listened, and couldn’t help look towards where the glasses fatty pointed. There was a lady slender legs wearing a red tight-fitting dress breeze and crystal sandals breeze walking.</p><p></p><p>A woman who dares to wear a tight-fitting dress like that is usually the type that has confidence in her own body.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang didn’t have a leg fetish, but he still admits that this red dress lady was beautiful, her thighs were slender and fair. The owner of the pair of legs obviously takes great care of them.</p><p></p><p>They say that when men look at women, a young boy looks at the face, when they wisen up a little they look at the boobs, and only mature men look at the legs.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang felt that he definitely wasn’t a mature man, because he had no inclination towards legs. Even if the street was filled with shining white legs, he wouldn’t even bat an eye. He also wouldn’t have the urge to grade like the three dudes over there.</p><p></p><p>Towards his roommates who claim that they want to kneel and lick the legs of celebrities from the neighbouring country, Song Shuhang’s inability to understand increased manifold.</p><p>[TL: I’m pretty sure he’s referring to Korea here.]</p><p></p><p>Something like legs, men have it too. Women’s legs are just a little more fair, a little more tender, there’s nothing special about them, right?</p><p></p><p>These were the thoughts in his head, if the three dudes learned of that, they would definitely have his face covered with spit.</p><p></p><p>“Hurry and look, it’s a 100 marks, a 100 marks!” Suddenly, the glasses fatty spoke with excitement, he couldn’t help raising his voice a little.</p><p></p><p>“Where?” The handsome man asked. Although glasses fatty’s grading skills wasn’t considered excellent, he was still someone with insight. Something like a 100 marks can’t possibly be something he casually brought out.</p><p></p><p>The lazy-looking short-haired man also sat up straight with curiosity, and looked towards the direction fatty was looking.</p><p></p><p>As before it was below the huge LED display, a beautiful, tall and slender figure walked out from a corner. She dragged along a huge suitcase, yet it didn’t seem to take any effort on her part.</p><p></p><p>Her long black hair reached her waist, and like a waterfall draping over her back, it fluttering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Despite the fact that she was just wearing sneakers, it was obvious that she her legs were longer than the people in her surroundings. Every step she took was just about the same distance as an ordinary person’s two or three steps.</p><p></p><p>She was simply the role model to be a natural female movie protagonist, even if she stood in the crowd doing nothing, she would give off the feeling of being a crane among a flock of chickens. A natural focal point for the masses.</p><p></p><p>The black-haired beauty walked very quickly, in a few steps she caught up with the lady in the red dress, which was also the one these 3 dudes graded. All perfect things might not seem so dazzling if they were alone, but once there was something to compare it with, they would appear to be a hundred times more dazzling.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the lady in the red dress became the object for comparison. When the black-haired lady walked past her, the two pairs of legs were obviously compared, and were graded. This comparison increases one’s aesthetic perception, and the black-haired lady’s legs seemed more and more dazzling.</p><p></p><p>“Ah Xu, I’m speechless. This truly deserves a 100 marks.” The handsome man immediately stood up, straightened his clothes, and arranged his hairdo.</p><p></p><p>“What are you doing?” The short-haired man asked.</p><p></p><p>“Picking her up! Such a perfect woman, it would be difficult to meet someone like that ever again in my lifetime. It doesn’t matter whether I succeed or not, I have to attempt no matter what, otherwise I will regret this my whole life.” The handsome man grinned, and his two rows of white teeth shined. He indeed possessed the talent to attract girls, and the aura of a winner in life, a dashing aura of sunshine.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn’t lose a thing if he failed, yet if he succeeded in picking her up, then it would be jackpot! Something like this had the possibility of a hundred gains and definitely no loss, why not do it?</p><p></p><p>At a time like this, a real man must have no fear for shame, and must march forth bravely!</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the handsome dude squeezed into the crowd, and squeezed towards the black-haired beauty.</p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, in less than two minutes, the handsome dude returned crestfallen.</p><p></p><p>“You failed? So quickly?” Glasses fatty was puzzled. He knew his comrade had a 90% and above chance of failing, but his comrade was still quite handsome, and was a good talker, how can he fail so quickly? With his abilities, even if he failed at picking the beauty up, there shouldn’t be any problem trying to chat with her for a moment, right?</p><p></p><p>“There wasn’t a chance to pick her up, that beauty’s legs are really long, and she walked very quickly. When she takes one step, I have to take several to keep up. I was even jogging  behind her yet I still couldn’t catch up.” The handsome dude had tears streaming down his cheeks.</p><p></p><p>“……” The short haired man had a speechless expression.</p><p></p><p>“Chi(giggling sound)!” Song Shuhang who was at the side laughed to the point he nearly received internal injuries, these 3 dudes are real jokers.</p><p></p><p>But to be honest, that black-haired beauty’s legs were really dazzling.</p><p></p><p>In this generation, the internet flourished. All types of beauties had emerged, and the masses were already exhausted from appreciating their beauty.</p><p></p><p>But true gold does not fear fire, a beauty that truly possessed unique points will definitely cause the gazes of the people surrounding her to be firmly attracted to her for eternity.</p><p></p><p>For example, the black-haired beauty from before, someone like that will definitely be remembered after a glance, the type that probably can’t be forgotten within a short period of time.</p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>A chance to encounter beauties was only a brief interlude for strolling in the streets.</p><p></p><p>After resting for a while, Song Shuhang got up and continued strolling around.</p><p></p><p>“I should buy some snacks back later.” He thought inside his heart. Previously, when he caught a cold his roommates took care of him, since he was strolling in Foodie Paradise, he had to bring something back as a token of appreciation.</p><p>I have no idea what they like to eat, so I’ll just bring a serving of many types of tasty food back.  				</p>'),(21,2,'Chapter 11 Turn back suddenly and discover that your destined person is there by the waning lan',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 11: Turn back suddenly, and discover that your destined person is there, by the waning lantern lights.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of divination masters, determining the future is like seeing the outside world through a foggy window, full of different kinds of mysteries.</p><p></p><p>But according to a ‘very famous’ divination master, depending on different choices that people make, different futures will be created.

After all, the world was wide, how can there be so many coincidences?</p><p></p><p>Yet he never imagined that after he strolled one circle, he would meet that lady again.</p><p></p><p>He was just leaving the shop named Glorious Beef, carrying a large bag of specialties from Foodie Paradise in his hands that he prepared to gift to his roommates. When he took his first step out of the door, he saw the black-haired lady dragging the large suitcase in his direction.</p><p></p><p>This time Song Shuhang truly experienced the power of ‘long legs walks very fast’ first-hand. Despite the fact that she was still very far away when he spotted her, in a blink of an eye, the black-haired lady had already strode in front of him with a few steps.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang slightly tilted his body to open a path, making it convenient for her to pass while dragging the large suitcase.</p><p></p><p>“Thank you.” The black-haired beauty’s smile was gentle and bashful.</p><p></p><p>She then entered the small shop behind him.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang nodded faintly. It was about time for him to start making his way back to the dormitory.</p><p></p><p>When he had just taken 2 or 3 steps forward, the black-haired beauty had already agilely bought the items she wanted, and simultaneously asked the shopkeeper about a matter. Song Shuhang inadvertently intruded upon their conversation, and unintentionally heard her question.</p><p></p><p>When Song Shuhang heard the question the lady asked, it made the leg that he had raised freeze in mid-air……</p><p></p><p>“Boss, may I ask if you’ve heard of a temple named ‘Ghost Lamp Temple’ in the vicinity of Luo Xin Street?”</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper pondered for a moment before he shook his head and said, “Ghost Lamp Temple? I’ve never heard of it. However, I’ve only moved in two years ago so I’m not very familiar with many places in the vicinity. Young lady, you could try going over to one of those old shops to ask around. The time they’ve spent in Luo Xin Street is much longer and they should know more.”</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper was obviously a good person, and explained with great passion; it could also be that in this generation full of scammers, the black-haired lady possessed a halo that had a +100 increase in favorable impressions attribute.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Lamp Temple, Luo Xin Street?</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Shuhang thought of the lady named Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather in the group.</p><p></p><p>Did I hear wrongly?</p><p></p><p>Thinking that way, Song Shuhang brought out the large cellphone from his pockets, and swiped his finger to unlock the screen. After that, he proficiently logged into the chatting software, and opened the Nine Provinces (1) Group.</p><p></p><p>After he had left, there were indeed more chat records from the group.</p><p></p><p>First was a message left by Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather more than two hours ago.</p><p></p><p>She said that she wasn’t able to acquire information regarding Ghost Lamp Temple, but she had already taken a taxi towards Luo Xin Street. She would then directly ask the locals there.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, 20 minutes ago, Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather left another message, “I‘ve already arrived at Luo Xin Street without a hitch. It’s very crowded and lively here, completely different from what I imagined. This is a gourmet food street, and I saw many delicious looking things here.”</p><p></p><p>It could be seen that she was in a good mood. Firstly, she arrived “smoothly” at Luo Xin Street.

She basically never even arrived at J City’s Luo Xin Street, and instead had made her way to the Foodie Paradise close to Jiang Nan University.</p><p></p><p>But if it truly wasn’t a coincidence, then that super long-legged black-haired beauty, could she be Soft Feather?</p><p></p><p>Once he thought about how such a modern and fashionable beauty could be a Xianxia chuunibyou, Song Shuhang felt an inexplicable feeling of pain in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However…… it still wasn’t enough to confirm that black-haired beauty was Soft Feather just based on these.</p><p></p><p>Because, by including the possibility that some special activities going on at the Ghost Lamp Temple in the Luo Xin Street for J City causing many people to rush there, then there would definitely be some of them who went to the wrong place just like the group’s Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>Such a probability was very small, but that didn’t mean it was impossible.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang’s finger continued to swipe on the cellphone’s display, however there wasn’t any new information from the chat group. Even North River’s Loose Practitioner wasn’t online, perhaps he went to help look for Ghost Lamp Temple?</p><p></p><p>Shuhang was continue touching the display when suddenly, Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather sent a voice message.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang subconsciously opened it up.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather exhaustedly dragged her suitcase out of the store with disappointment. This was already her 12th store. The suggestion by the shopkeeper earlier was great, but she had already asked both old and new shops yet there wasn’t a single one who knew of the Ghost Lamp Temple.</p><p></p><p>Sighing, she drew out her cellphone, and nimbly tapped on her phone, opened the chatting software, and opened the Nine Provinces (1) Group chat window.</p><p></p><p>There was no news from senior North River’s Loose Practitioner, who she pinned her hopes on.</p><p></p><p>Because it was not convenient to type with one hand, she made use of the voice message function, with a gentle voice she said, “Senior North River, have you received and information regarding Ghost Lamp Temple? I have gone around asking many shops in Luo Xin Street, yet there wasn’t a single person who possesses any information regarding Ghost Lamp Temple. Please reply once you hear this.”</p><p></p><p>Releasing her thumb, the voice message was sent.</p><p></p><p>She kept her phone. Before receiving news from North River’s Loose Practitioner, she must continue asking around Luo Xin Street’s shops regarding Ghost Lamp Temple, she mustn’t give up!</p><p></p><p>At the shop’s entrance, Soft Feather saw that the youngster who gave way to her was still standing by the side of the road, tapping and swiping on his phone, it was unclear what he was doing.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather did not mind, and continued walking.</p><p></p><p>Right at this time…… The youngster’s cellphone sent out a voice that was incomparably familiar to Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>“Senior North River, have you received and information regarding Ghost Lamp Temple? I have gone around asking many shops in Luo Xin Street, yet there wasn’t a single person who possesses any information regarding Ghost Lamp Temple. Please reply once you hear this.”</p><p></p><p>This…… Isn’t this my voice?</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, it’s the voice message that I had just sent!</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather first blankly stared, then felt an indescribable happiness bubbling in her heart; this man who looked like a youngster in front of her was actually a senior from Nine Provinces (1) Group!</p><p></p><p>The lost and dejected Soft Feather immediately felt like someone who caught a rope while being swept by the currents!</p><p></p><p>With three steps, she stepped over to the side of the ‘senior’ who looked like a youngster!</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang had just tapped on the voice message sent by Soft Feather, her gentle voice was truly pleasant to the ear. Suddenly, he felt someone approaching him from behind.</p><p></p><p>What followed was a fragrant wind entering his nose, there was a faint scent of flowers, yet it was also similar to the body fragrance of ladies.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang turned around, and saw the long-legged black-haired lady standing behind him with a happy face, and her gaze was fixed onto his cellphone.</p><p></p><p>“Nine Provinces (1) Group?” The black-haired lady’s gentle voice was full of happiness as if she was ‘meeting an old friend in a foreign place’.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Song Shuhang didn’t have the slightest idea of what kind of expression he should have facing this lady.</p><p></p><p>There was no longer a need for her to introduce herself, if Song Shuhang still couldn’t guess her identity, he should buy a block of tofu and kill himself with it.</p><p>[TL: This is a chinese joke, because it’s not possible to kill yourself with tofu because of how soft tofu is.]</p><p></p><p>“Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather?” Song Shuhang felt that his voice was very unnatural, and full of awkwardness.</p><p></p><p>“That’s me! May I ask for senior’s dao name?” Soft Feather finally calmed down, and began carefully sizing up this ‘senior’.</p><p></p><p>According to her memory, other than Su Clan’s Ah Shiliu who went through tribulation yesterday, all other fellow daoists from Nine Provinces (1) Group were her seniors.</p><p></p><p>This senior in front of me has the appearance of a 18 or 19 years old, but that definitely can’t be his true age, right? His height is approximately 1.75m, with a kind face, and looks really nice to chat with.</p><p></p><p>A kind face…… To be frank that is basically having a face with looks that makes someone seem like a good person, and it’s also the type that is easily thrown into the friendzone.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she couldn’t sense this senior’s stage of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It seems like this senior has completely restrained his aura, when he stands in front of me, it’s like he has completely blended into the world of ordinary people, this is already the stage of returning back to the natural state like father, right? This was how Soft Feather thought.</p><p></p><p>Senior?! Being addressed like this made Song Shuhang’s liver hurt a little.  				</p>'),(22,2,'Chapter 12 Senior Song your phone is also out of battery',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 12: Senior Song, your phone is also out of battery</p><p></p><p>This black-haired lady looks approximately in her early twenties, but my 18th birthday just passed not too long ago, all right? Could it be that I look that old? Causing her to assume I’m a mature uncle?</p><p></p><p>Furthermore…… dao name? He immediately thought of the group’s chuuni profile pages. Something like Yellow Mountain’s True Monarch, North River’s Loose Practitioner, XX Cave Master, XX Palace Master and so on, he suddenly felt the pain in his liver intensify.</p><p></p><p>“Cough cough, you may call me Song Shuhang. Also…… Let’s not mention the dao name for now.” Song Shuhang replied, he doesn’t want others to think he has chuunibyou.</p><p></p><p>“Ah? Sorry senior. I forgot about that.” Soft Feather apologetically said. As a cultivator, it’s common sense to never mention dao names in public, she was just that happy and excited that she forgot.</p><p></p><p>“Cough, stop calling me senior.” Song Shuhang coughed twice. He felt like the winter cough that he had slowly recovered from previously was suddenly showing signs of becoming more severe.</p><p></p><p>“Ah.” Soft Feather gasped softly, and her heart sank. This senior seems to be the type that is hard to get along with? That’s to be expected, after all it isn’t possible that everyone in the group is as friendly as senior North River.</p><p></p><p>Plus, although this senior was obviously in Luo Xin Street he had not spoken up in the chat, was it possible that he was a cold and indifferent person and had no intentions of offering help? As she thought of this, she could not help but feel disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Just as Soft Feather was letting her thoughts run wild, Song Shuhang added, “Calling me Song Shuhang directly is fine.”</p><p></p><p>“Eh?” Soft Feather momentarily blanked. “That shouldn’t be the way, right?”</p><p></p><p>“Please just call me Song Shuhang. If you really don’t want to call me by my full name, then Shuhang, Xiaohang, Xiaosong are also fine as well, it’s up to you.” Song Shuhang resolutely replied.</p><p></p><p>If Soft Feather continued to call him senior every time she spoke, then he would feel very ashamed. Afterall, this was the real world!</p><p></p><p>“Song Shu…… Senior.” Halfway through calling his name, Soft Feather felt rather awkward and still added the word “Senior”.</p><p></p><p>But her heart had relaxed completely in this moment, and a happy smile was revealed on her face. It seemed like this senior was a good person, and not cold and indifferent.If it was like this, then perhaps senior would help her!</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang raised his hand and rubbed his face vigorously. He had been completely defeated. “Fine, call me whatever you want.”</p><p></p><p>“Senior Song, did you come here to help me? Soft Feather joyfully replied.</p><p></p><p>“Let’s talk while we walk.” Song Shuhang lifted the large bag he was holding. The two of them plus that huge suitcase were blocking the way so it would be better if they found a quiet place to talk.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather immediately quietly caught up to Shuhang.</p><p></p><p>“I saw the chatlogs in the group. The place you want to go is the Luo Xin Street of J City, isn’t it?” Song Shuhang said.</p><p></p><p>“En, J City’s Luo Xin Street. Please wait, Senior, could it be…” Soft Feather was naturally very smart. From Song Shuhang’s tone and attitude, she could guess the actual situation. With a teary, disappointed face, she said, “Could it be that this is not Luo Xin Street?”</p><p></p><p>“This is indeed Luo Xin Street, however, this is Jiang Nan City’s Luo Xin Street, not the one in J City.” Song Shuhang sighed and replied.</p><p></p><p>“…” Soft Feather’s small face instantly turned beet red. This time, she truly was embarrassed. After a long while, she asked in a small voice, “Then, Senior Song, do you know how to get to J City’s Luo Xin Street?”</p><p></p><p>“I have not been there before, but are you able to navigate the way?” Song Shuhang smiled warmly.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather knocked on her own head a few times before she once again took up her phone and swiped a few times… However, after swiping just twice, the phone suddenly rang with the soothing sound of music before the screen went dark.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather lifted her head and looked towards Song Shuhang. Those were a pair of large, watery eyes. “Senior Song, my phone ran out of battery.”</p><p></p><p>“…” Song Shuhang felt as though his liver ached with a vague pain. This black-haired beauty was a natural klutz?</p><p></p><p>But he still tossed his phone over. “Then use mine.”</p><p></p><p>“Thank you, senior.” Soft Feather happily received Shuhang’s phone, and swiped on it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the phone also emitted a short and loud sonorous music, and the phone’s display turned dark.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather lifted her head another time as she looked at Song Shuhang. Those watery eyes had already misted over. “Senior Song, your phone is also out of battery.”</p><p></p><p>Fuck! Song Shuhang only just recalled that when he left the house, his phone was only at 6% battery. After he had left the dormitory for close to three hours and surfed the net just now, it just so happened that at this moment, the phone went flat.</p><p></p><p>Awkwardly taking back his phone, Shuhang asked, “Soft Feather, are you in a hurry to get to Ghost Lamp Temple?”</p><p></p><p>“Although I’m not in a hurry, the faster the better, problems might occur the more things are delayed.” Soft Feather’s voice was as gentle as before. If she takes too long, her father would return from Senior Mad Saber Three Waves’ house, and he will catch her and bring her home.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this was also the reason why she had thrown off Mad Saber Three Waves in the group chat earlier.</p><p></p><p>If her daddy came home, then she couldn’t sneak out anymore.</p><p></p><p>“Then, how about you go to the dormitory with me? I’ll use my computer to check the route for you while you take that chance to charge your phone. However, my dormitory is a little more than twenty minutes away, is that fine?” Song Shuhang suggested.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang is a man who is as he looks, he has a good-natured looking face, and thus is a good old man in his bones.</p><p></p><p>So no matter what, he could never do something like tossing Soft Feather aside. The truth was, other than gays, there would be very few men who could mercilessly abandon such a beauty.</p><p></p><p>“Dormitory? Is that where senior is living in seclusion?” Soft Feather’s eyes glowed as she said, “A 20 minute journey is no problem at all!”</p><p></p><p>“Then, shall we?” Song Shuhang asked.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather vigorously nodded, and pulled her large suitcase in pursuit of Shuhang’s back.</p><p></p><p>A truly marvelous target for kidnapping. Song Shuhang’s was somewhat worried in his heart since he kept feeling that two sticks of lollipops would be enough to abduct this girl.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p>……</p><p></p><p>There’s a proverb that says, when men and women pair up together, all labor isn’t tiring.</p><p></p><p>According to reason, when men and women do something together, they will have multiple times the energy. However…… After Song Shuhang walked for 5 minutes with Soft Feather, he felt short of breath, and much more tired.</p><p></p><p>He bitterly smiled as he looked at Soft Feather beside him, the words spoken by the handsome dude among the three at the public square surfaced in his mind: “That beauty’s legs are really long, and she walked very quickly. When she took one step, I had to take several to keep up. I was even jogging behind her yet I still couldn’t catch up.”</p><p></p><p>Long legs truly have a large advantage! Her single step was equivalent to two steps from him!</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather had already tried her best to lower her pace, yet Shuhang still needed to jog. How can this not be tiring?</p><p></p><p>“Senior, you seem to be panting?” Soft Feather looked towards Shuhang in confusion. This cannot be, right? We’ve only been walking for 5 minutes, how could this make a senior with great achievements in cultivation gasp for breath?</p><p></p><p>“Huu, let’s walk slowly, there’s no hurry.” Song Shuhang adjusted his breathing pattern.</p><p></p><p>“Oh.” Soft Feather pretended to understand yet didn’t seem to understand as she nodded, she felt that this ‘Senior’ was in a condition that didn’t seem right, as if his physical capabilities were very low.</p><p></p><p>But she was an intelligent lady, and respected others’ privacy. Since senior didn’t say, then she definitely wouldn’t be nosy, so as to not provoke hostility.</p><p></p><p>Therefore she took the initiative to match his pace, the strides of her long legs shrunk, until she maintained the same as Song Shuhang’s strides.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang finally felt a lot more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>The two of them had already left Luo Xin Street, and walked further and further away.</p><p></p><p>What was a great coincidence was that behind them, the three brothers who were grading various kinds of beautiful legs were carrying all kinds of large and small bags as they left Luo Xin Street.</p><p></p><p>“Ehh? One hundred! It’s one hundred again!” Fatty Ah Xu excitedly pointed towards Soft Feather’s back figure.</p><p></p><p>The handsome man immediately perked up. “Where? This time, I must catch up to her!”</p><p></p><p>“You’ve no hope.” Short Haired Guy lazily replied, “There’s already a man by her side”</p><p></p><p>The handsome man looked at Song Shuhang who was at the side of Soft Feather and instantly lost hope. “She’s already taken, god dammit!”</p><p></p><p>“Although the flower already has an owner, the hoe is merciless. As long as the hoe is wielded properly, there’s no wall that can’t be dug till it falls. Proceed bravely!” Ah Xu chuckled and said.</p><p></p><p>“I don’t have any interest in NTRing other people’s walls.” At this point, the handsome man unexpectedly displayed his bottom line.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, the handsome man fixed his eyes onto Song Shuhang’s back. “Hey, Have you guys noticed that that guy seems a little familiar?”</p><p></p><p>“Yep, it’s normal that you find him familiar. Because when we were discussing the girl who scored one hundred points at the plaza earlier, he was sitting right beside us.” Short Haired Guy continued to speak lazily.</p><p></p><p>“…” Fatty Ah Xu.</p><p></p><p>“…” Handsome man.</p><p></p><p>He was sitting right beside us, he was sitting right beside us…… This sentence reverberated endlessly in the handsome man’s ears.</p><p></p><p>The handsome man resolutely knelt onto the ground, “Is this the fabled God of Strategies from the legends!?”  				</p>'),(23,2,'Chapter 13 If',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 13: If……</p><p></p><p>A school dormitory is a wondrous place, the ladies’ dormitory is forbidden ground for the males, any male who dare take a single step into that minefield all receive the death penalty.</p><p></p><p>But to the ladies, the male dormitory is like their vegetable garden at home. They can enter or leave as and when they want to. Therefore, Song Shuhang did not encounter any obstacles bringing a girl into his dormitory.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, since it was Sunday, a majority of the students living in the dormitories went out to have fun, or stayed in the dormitory to play games. When Song Shuhang brought Soft Feather back, it didn’t attract much attention.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang’s dorm room was on the 2nd story, and there was an elevator in the dormitory. However, most of the people living in the dormitory all take the elevator. Since it’s only one floor, taking the stairs to his room is much faster than taking the elevator.</p><p></p><p>“Shall I help you bring up your suitcase?” Song Shuhang looked at the huge suitcase pulled by Soft Feather, as a man, offering to carry a lady’s suitcase and bags are things that mustn’t be declined.</p><p></p><p>“Sorry to trouble Senior then.” Soft Feather bashfully smiled, and pushed the huge suitcase to Song Shuhang.</p><p></p><p>During the journey, Song Shuhang saw Soft Feather drag that huge suitcase the whole time.  When they passed by areas where there were uneven roads, she would even carry it past those roads like it was a very simple task.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he assumed that this huge suitcase wasn’t filled, and should be pretty light.</p><p></p><p>When he gripped the suitcase, and tried to pull it upwards, his face immediately flushed!</p><p></p><p>He only managed to lift the suitcase a small bit after amassing his strength. What the fuck, this box is at least 50-60 kilograms, and nearly the weight of an adult male!</p><p></p><p>He widened his eyes and stared at Soft Feather, and stared at her soft and slender hands. This girl, is she secretly a tomboy? For the whole journey, she pulled along this thing that is about 120-130jin like she was flying, wasn’t it exhausting?”</p><p>[TL: 1 jin is 0.5kg, no idea why author bothered to use it since kilograms is above.]</p><p></p><p>And I naively thought that she was a good target for kidnapping? Simply with this strength of hers, anybody who wants to kidnap her had better prepare a coffin.</p><p></p><p>“Senior?” Soft Feather looked towards the senior, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>“Cough! Let us take the elevator.” Song Shuhang quickly decided and said. With his strength, there’s no problem for him to carry this box up, but it would be very tiring.</p><p></p><p>“Oh.” Soft Feather pretended to understand but didn’t seem to understand as she nodded. This has been mentioned before, she is a good lady, and won’t ask superfluous questions. Furthermore, as a guest, she will not interfere with the host’s decisions, for the guest should always follow the host’s intentions.</p><p></p><p>The elevator slowly rose, at a time like that there was basically nobody using the elevator, so there was no need to wait.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p>……</p><p></p><p>There wasn’t a single soul in the dormitory room.</p><p></p><p>His roommates usually return around 3-4PM, there were times they even came back at night.</p><p></p><p>The dormitory room wasn’t considered large, being made for only 4 people to live in. Although the place was small, it had everything necessary. There was an attached bathroom, a balcony, a washboard and a small kitchen.</p><p></p><p>“Take a seat, would you like something to drink?” Song Shuhang turned on the computer, and let Soft Feather sit down.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather obediently sat down, and replied, “Jade Spirit Vein Tea.”</p><p></p><p>“?” Song Shuhang was confused.</p><p></p><p>Jade Spirit Vein Tea? What’s that? A new beverage? Why haven’t I heard of it before?</p><p></p><p>He blanked out for a moment, then quickly remembered this long-legged beauty’s identity. Don’t just see her as a youthful and pretty girl, she’s a patient deeply afflicted with chuunibyou!</p><p></p><p>This so-called Jade Spirit Vein Tea, should be something created by the minds of those chuunibyou patients in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang only felt his liver start to faintly hurt again.</p><p></p><p>“I don’t have those kind of things here temporarily, but I have orange juice, clean water, coke and milk… pick one.” Song Shuhang straightforwardly gave her a multiple choice question, he was afraid that Soft Feather might ask him for frightening things like ‘Enriching Dragon Blood Tea’, ‘Phoenix Liquid’ and so on.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather was stunned, Senior’s place doesn’t even have Jade Spirit Vein Tea?</p><p></p><p>One must know that Jade Spirit Vein Tea is the spirit tea that is most commonly served by cultivators to receive guests.</p><p></p><p>It contains very little Spiritual Qi, but the tea is full of fragrance, with a rich taste that can last for a long time, it’s the most economic tea for entertaining guests. Moreover, one can drink it by themselves if they feel like it and it can even one’s strengthen physique. Although the effects aren’t as miraculous as pills, Jade Spirit Vein Tea’s price is cheaper than pills by thousands of times. As long as one is a cultivator, it’s essential to possess this, right?</p><p></p><p>Wait, I got it!</p><p></p><p>Senior is living here in seclusion, in the city, living like ordinary people. It is said that to temper themselves, every 150 years, some seniors would live in with ordinary people and follow their way of life, and truly live like an ordinary person, that is called ‘Realm Of Mortal Tempering’! Although this cannot increase their strength, this can make one’s will more resolute, and make one’s spirit more clear and bright!</p><p></p><p>“Then, Senior, please give me orange juice, thank you.” Soft Feather revealed a sweet smile.</p><p></p><p>“Alright, give me a moment.”</p><p></p><p>After a short while, Song Shuhang carried over a large cup of orange juice poured from the refrigerator in the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather received the orange juice, “Thank you Senior.”</p><p></p><p>“You’re welcome.” Song Shuhang replied. This was a good lady, good character, polite, it’s a pity that she had chuuni. He sat in front of the computer, and connected to the internet.</p><p></p><p>He proficiently opened up Baidu Maps, and entered J City, Luo Xin Street.</p><p>[TL: In case you don’t know this, Baidu is like Google in China, and Google is also banned there.]</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, the map marked out the location of Luo Xin Street in J City.</p><p></p><p>“I’ve checked, this place is a little far from J City’s Luo Xin Street.” Song Shuhang said.</p><p></p><p>Originally, taking a taxi from Jiang Nan region’s airport to J City’s Luo Xin Street requires 5 hours or so. But Soft Feather mistook her destination. Luckily, Jiang Nan University City was bordering J City, so something like going north when the destination was south did not occur, she only stumbled upon the wrong path midway.</p><p></p><p>Right now, if she takes off from Jiang Nan University City, the journey to J City’s Luo Xin Street requires another 3.5 hours, and this is without considering the road traffic/condition. To be honest, the condition/traffic of these roads are incredibly inferior, the real amount of time needed to reach there is approximately 5 hours or so.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather moved over, and when she saw the long distance, she couldn’t help but open her mouth wide, “Senior, for such a long distance can a taxi go there?”</p><p></p><p>“Well, they can, but I’m afraid that not many of them will be willing to do so.”  Song Shuhang replied.</p><p></p><p>He then explained to Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>A 5 hour car journey is a little far, although the various cities in the vicinity of Jiang Nan region can go from one city to another, most of the taxis drivers work on shifts.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, going there takes 5 hours, and returning takes another 5 hours. In total it’s a 10 hour car journey, how many taxi drivers would want to do this? This is something that isn’t a good deal even if there were incentives.</p><p></p><p>“Then what do we do?” Soft Feather asked.</p><p></p><p>“Take a train, luckily, there’s a train station pretty close to J City’s Luo Xin Street, Black Elephant Station. This University City’s vicinity also has a station like this. Taking a train is also faster than taking a taxi, and it would take at most 2 hours to arrive.” Song Shuhang explained.</p><p></p><p>“Then what time shall we leave?” Soft Feather’s eyes shone.</p><p></p><p>“No rush, train tickets can now be booked on the same day. Let me see, the train from University City towards Black Elephant Station takes off at 4PM. So you will make it as long as you collect the ticket and enter the station by 3:30PM.”</p><p></p><p>Huh? Wait!</p><p></p><p>What time are we leaving? We?</p><p></p><p>This lady can’t be thinking that I will accompany her to J City’s Luo Xin Street, right?</p><p></p><p>I still have classes tomorrow, I’m still a mere student, and can’t just leave as I please!</p><p></p><p>“Then Senior, let us quickly book two tickets online. Do you need my identity card?” Soft Feather happily said, she felt very lucky that she was able to meet someone willing to help her like Senior Song.</p><p></p><p>“Cough cough, us?” Song Shuhang’s cold cough has relapsed, “You mean you want to book two tickets? You and me?”</p><p></p><p>“Ah? Senior isn’t accompanying me there?” Soft Feather stared blankly, and her face immediately blushed.</p><p></p><p>She was indeed too excited earlier, and assumed that Song Shuhang would accompany her to J City. She didn’t even ask for Senior’s input, it was too rude of her.</p><p></p><p>“Senior, I was too rude earlier, and didn’t ask for Senior’s opinion before acting on my own initiative. Senior, may I ask if you can accompany me on a trip to J City’s Luo Xin Street? To be honest, I’m…… I’m bad with directions, I’m afraid I won’t be able to find Ghost Lamp Temple.” Soft Feather beseeched.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang sighed, and rejected her, “Although I wish to help, I’m afraid I’m powerless in this matter.”</p><p></p><p>The train leaves at 4PM, so it will be at least 6:30PM in the evening when it reaches. It is unknown what Soft Feather wants to do there, and what time she will be done with her matters there. But one thing is for sure, I wouldn’t be able to get back by noon tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>Yet he has classes at noon tomorrow!</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather was immediately incredibly disappointed, she’s a lady whose thoughts are written all over her face, “Senior, is it because you don’t have time?”</p><p></p><p>“Yep, it’s because I have classes at noon tomorrow.” Song Shuhang answered.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the face of Soft Feather that looked like she was about to kneel, he suddenly felt that his rejection earlier was a little too stern, and was worried that it hurt this lady’s fragile heart.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of that, he negotiated, “If……. What I mean is, Soft Feather, if you’re not in too much of a hurry, I do have the time to accompany you to J City next Friday. I am currently a student, and only have rest days on Saturday and Sunday.</p><p></p><p>Next Friday? Soft Feather was still disappointed. Although she could wait 1 or 2 days, 5 days is a little too long. Her father might enjoy messing with people, but he obviously wouldn’t stay and play at Mad Saber Three Waves’ place for half a month.</p><p></p><p>However, she suddenly thought of something, and her eyes shined brightly. She seriously asked, “Senior Song, if you don’t have classes tomorrow afternoon…… and I’m only hypothesising, can you accompany me to J City then?”  				</p>'),(24,2,'Chapter 14 Let me send two chests of medicinal ingredients as my gift of thanks',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 14: Let me send two chests of medicinal ingredients as my gift of thanks</p><p></p><p>“Cough, cough, Soft Feather, if the matters you want to do don’t require much time, then perhaps it’s possible.” Song Shuhang chuckled.</p><p></p><p>But tomorrow’s afternoon class was planned even before school reopened, there’s no way it would be cancelled unless there was a special reason.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang did not want to be entangled in this topic for too long, and immediately changed the subject, “Soft Feather, the place you’re attempting to go to is Ghost Lamp Temple, right? Why didn’t you confirm its location before setting off?”</p><p></p><p>The innocent young lady was easily swayed into a different subject, “Yes, I only know that the destination is at J City Luo Xin Street, and had my martial nephews book the air ticket before rushing over. I never expected Ghost Lamp Temple to be this hard to find.”</p><p></p><p>Martial nephews…… There’s still such a thing in this day and age?</p><p></p><p>While lost in thought, Song Shuhang tapped on the keyboard, and entered J City, Luo Xin Street, Ghost Lamp Temple on the search bar.</p><p></p><p>There was information on J City and Luo Xin Street, but no information on Ghost Lamp Temple at all, there was no sign on the map either.</p><p></p><p>It should either be a very small temple, or it had already closed down long ago, right?</p><p></p><p>“Senior Song, can you let me borrow your computer? I want to gather information myself, also, perhaps Senior North River from the group has some news!” Soft Feather suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang nodded, he first logged out of his chat account, then got up from the seat.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather sweetly smiled, sat down, and proficiently typed in her chat credentials</p><p></p><p>The group’s North River’s Loose Practitioner as before didn’t reply, it was rare for this Senior to stay offline for so long. Shuhang thought he was a true 24/7 internet warrior.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather was a little disappointed, she closed the chat window and began searching for all the information regarding Luo Xin Street and its surrounding temples. She began to guess whether Ghost Lamp Temple no longer existed, or it had already changed its name.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang watched from the side for a while, when he suddenly remembered that both his and Soft Feather’s phones were out of battery.</p><p></p><p>“Soft Feather, give me your phone. I have a charger here, it should take only an hour or so to fully charge.” Song Shuhang said.</p><p></p><p>“Thank you, Senior!” Soft Feather quickly took out her phone and handed it over to Song Shuhang.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang received it, and brought his phone to charge at the same time as well.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>When  Song Shuhang turned around, Soft Feather’s hands danced on the keyboard at lightning speeds, *pa pa pa pa pa pa*. In that moment her hand speed was at least 900 APM! With such hand speeds, if she became a professional gamer, she could become a god that schooled the others.</p><p>[ED: APM is a term that means Actions Per Minute. It’s often used in MOBA(Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games. E.g. Starcraft, LoL, Dota]</p><p></p><p>On the computer, more and more windows rapidly popped up and closed; many webpages opened and refreshed.</p><p></p><p>Very soon, a male student’s information was displayed.</p><p></p><p>A half body portrait of Song Shuhang with a wide smile, and his personal information beside it.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang, Jiang Nan University’s Mechanical Engineering Discipline, Machinery Designs and Manufacturing Faculty’s 19th department 43rd class.</p><p></p><p>Soon after a window quickly popped up, it was Song Shuhang’s class timetable.</p><p></p><p>What immediately popped up after was Monday afternoon’s class…… Professor Renshui.</p><p></p><p>That was a young, promising and handsome professor. He stood tall and straight, wore a black-framed spectacles, with a gentle smile on his face. He could be classified as the type of man that effortlessly attracts the hearts of all the young maidens wherever he goes</p><p></p><p>Everything…… Happened in a flash.</p><p></p><p>After acquiring the information she wanted, Soft Feather once again closed all of the webpages at high speeds.</p><p></p><p>A class that had been scheduled for a long time naturally wouldn’t casually be cancelled, but accidents always happen in the world. For example, the teacher in charge of the class getting hit by a car and hurting his leg, missing a step and spraining his leg, accidentally falling off the bed and spraining his leg, getting bitten by a dog on his leg…… And so on, anyways, all kinds of leg injuries that would cause hospitalization. That way, tomorrow’s afternoon class should either be suspended or delayed for a couple of days, right?</p><p></p><p>This was what Soft Feather thought in her heart, she felt that this idea of hers was fantastic, and secretly praised herself inside.</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>On the other side of town, in the apartment building for teachers over 10km away.</p><p></p><p>Teacher Renshui, who was playing with his daughter, suddenly shivered for unknown reasons, and immediately sneezed multiple times. He rubbed his nose as he thought.</p><p></p><p>There’s another schoolgirl thinking of this handsome and charismatic teacher again?</p><p></p><p>Oh kids, being too handsome also causes headaches, don’t you know he’s already married and has a career?</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>After Soft Feather closed the web page, she stealthily turned around to look at Song Shuhang. Realizing that he was still on the other side trying to charge the phones, she quietly breathed a sigh of relief, giving off a feeling like she was up to mischief behind her senior.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, after she investigated so much information, her instincts toldl her…… Senior Song seemed more and more like an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>She once again thought of the scene and the words Song Shuhang said when they met, “Call me little Song, or even Shuhang, please don’t call me Senior anymore.”</p><p></p><p>Is it because Senior Song’s ‘Realm Of Mortal Tempering’ skills are too profound, or is it just her misunderstanding something?</p><p></p><p>After closing all of the web pages, Soft Feather stretched her fingers.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, her gaze fell onto the open notebook beside the computer. On it was a dazzling list of medicine names, it was precisely the simplified body tempering liquid posted by Medicine Master from Nine Provinces (1) Group.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang initially wanted to bring this to his cousin Zhao Yaya for research, however it doesn’t include Fresh Overlord Branch, Nine-Yang Scarlet Flame Bamboo, Morning Dew Mysterious Grass and the other medicinal ingredients that are brimming with the smell of chuuni.</p><p></p><p>Senior Song is also researching this pill recipe? Soft Feather wondered in her heart.</p><p></p><p>However, she quickly realized that the recipe copied by Song Shuhang didn’t seem to be the complete version.</p><p></p><p>Why did Senior only copy down the simple and ordinary medicinal ingredients?</p><p></p><p>Why didn’t he include Morning Dew Mysterious Grass and some of the other ingredients?</p><p></p><p>Wait, could it be that Senior Song actually wants to go deeper with the philosophy of Senior Medicine Master’s recipe? To take another step forward in lowering the costs of producing the body tempering liquid?</p><p></p><p>When she thought of it this way, Soft Feathers eyes immediately shone bright.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, right as Song Shuhang turned around, he saw Soft Feather staring at his notebook. This is bad, written on it is that chuuni pill recipe!</p><p></p><p>This is truly like having mud fall on the crotch of his pants, even though it wasn’t poop, it is now poop. Soft Feather definitely thinks that I am her kindred spirit, a person who is also deeply afflicted by Xianxia chuunibyou.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Soft Feather opened her mouth to ask a question that felt full of chuuni to Shuhang, “Senior, are you also researching Senior Medicine Master’s recipe? How many furnaces can you succeed with in one try?”</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather happily asked with the mentality of one asking for guidance from her senior.</p><p></p><p>She followed the recipe provided by Senior Medicine Master and attempted many times, because her control over the flames was insufficient, she only succeeded 3 out of 10 times. It’s a pity that although she likes concocting pills, she doesn’t have the slightest talent in it.</p><p></p><p>Wasting medicinal ingredients like that, if other cultivators saw they would definitely drown her in spittle. However, she has a strong and rich father, a small amount of wasted medicinal ingredients for concocting body tempering liquid is just like wasting a drop of water in their pond at Spiritual Butterfly Island, an extremely trivial matter.</p><p></p><p>“I didn’t concoct.” Song Shuhang looked like he was about to cry, he had indeed been taken to be her kindred spirit.</p><p></p><p>“Why? Could it be that Senior Song wants to further improve Senior Medicine Master’s recipe?” Soft Feathers eyes sparkled as she excitedly spoke.</p><p></p><p>“……” Song Shuhang was silent, he originally wanted to reply by saying that he can’t possibly be concocting a strange chuuni pill like this, but seeing the glittering light in Soft Feather’s eyes, he felt that it wasn’t right to hurt this lady.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a long time, he found a rather honest answer, “Actually, it is because medicinal ingredients are not convenient to find here. Due to many complicated reasons, I don’t have any medicinal ingredients on hand, that’s why…… I simply didn’t have the opportunity to concoct.”</p><p></p><p>What he said was fact, among the medicinal ingredients in the recipe, even after eliminating those Xuanhuan chuuni ingredients, the other ingredients added together aren’t cheap. One must know that precious medicinal ingredients like Ginseng are priced by per liangs.</p><p>[TL:1 liang = 50grams]</p><p></p><p>As a student, he simply couldn’t buy it, not even if he sold his kidney!</p><p></p><p>“Ah? I’m so sorry Senior, so there was a reason like this.” Soft Feather nodded and said, while delighted in her heart!</p><p></p><p>Although she didn’t know why Senior Song doesn’t even have the medicinal ingredients for a mere body tempering liquid, in Spiritual Butterfly Island such medicinal ingredients can be stacked to be as tall as a mountain!</p><p></p><p>“Senior, after I return, let me send two chests of medicinal ingredients as my gift of thanks!” Soft Feather insisted.</p><p></p><p>This was how she planned to repay Shuhang. In any case, by hook or by crook, she had already decided to have Shuhang help her look for Ghost Lamp Temple.</p><p></p><p>Two chests of medicinal ingredients, these words sounded so domineering.</p><p></p><p>To reinterpret these words as something more straightforward it means: Senior, I’ll send you two boxes of ginseng as a gift of thanks.</p><p></p><p>If the interpretation above is still not blunt enough, then take a look at this version: Senior, I’ll send you two boxes of gold bars as my gift of thanks!</p><p></p><p>The value of the medicinal ingredients Soft Feather wanted to send was definitely many times more expensive than gold bars.</p><p></p><p>It was a pity that of this moment Song Shuhang simply didn’t know the value of these two chests of medicinal ingredients that Soft Feather mentioned, otherwise he would’ve knelt to this tyrant long ago!  				</p>'),(25,2,'Chapter 15 Professor Renshuis injury',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 15: Professor Renshui’s injury</p><p></p><p>In Song Shuhang’s mind he thought. I’m afraid these two chests of medicinal ingredients are various kinds of weird things, right? At the very least it won’t be expensive items.</p><p></p><p>So he casually said, “Then I’ll first thank you. By the way, do you have an account for the ticket booking website?”</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather shook her head, it didn’t matter whether it was an air ticket or land ticket, she had never needed to book one herself. Her family had many servant disciples in Spiritual Butterfly Island.</p><p></p><p>“Pass me your identification card then, I’ll book a ticket for you in a moment.” Song Shuhang replied.</p><p></p><p>“Alright!” Soft Feather obediently handed over her identification card, then asked, “Senior Song, may I go look around on the balcony?”</p><p></p><p>“Don’t be so reserved, do whatever you like.” Song Shuhang smiled as he spoke. What a good and polite lady, a pity she’s a chuuni.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather bashfully grinned, then walked to the balcony and surveyed the outside.</p><p></p><p>On the east side of the balcony was a wide path and the school’s garden, with nothing blocking the view. Although this was only the second floor, the field of view was rather vast.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather first carefully observed Song Shuhang, then sneakily executed a small magic to cancel energy fluctuations to hide her following actions, so that ‘Senior Song’ didn’t find out.</p><p></p><p>With her preparations done, she stealthily took out a pair of contact lenses from her pocket and put them on.</p><p></p><p>Don’t look down on these. These are magical treasures personally refined by Spiritual Butterfly’s Respected Sage, Desiring Thousand Miles Eyes, Take It Up A Notch!</p><p></p><p>The name was a little long, but this was basically an upgraded version of Thousand Miles Eyes.</p><p></p><p>Once the lenses are put on, it’s like the name implies, it could give the person a view from high altitudes, like a god overlooking the land.</p><p></p><p>This was the painstaking creation of a father who knew his daughter easily gets lost. It was for his daughter to have a bird’s eye view of an area when she loses her directions and to help her find the correct path. It was full of fatherly love.</p><p></p><p>They say that a daughter is like a father’s lover in his previous lifetime, sure enough, these words were right.</p><p></p><p>If it was a son, Spiritual Butterfly’s Respected Safe definitely wouldn’t put so much thought into this. A proper adult man getting lost, wouldn’t that be humiliating if it was known? If you can’t find the path, don’t you know how to tear down whatever is in the way and take a straight path towards the destination? To advance bravely is a man’s dream!</p><p>[TL: The a man’s dream here has the exact same meaning/words as otoko no roman in Japanese, if you know what that means.]</p><p></p><p>Putting aside this matter, let’s get back to Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather used the magical treasure’s godly view to quickly lock onto Jiang Nan University’s teachers’ apartments. Then following the intelligence, smoothly locked onto that tall and scholarly Professor Renshui who wore a pair of black framed spectacles.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the innocent teacher Renshui…… was having an afternoon nap with his daughter who was just 6 months old.</p><p></p><p>Because ‘having an afternoon nap with his daughter’ could easily lead some gentlemen to misunderstand, it was necessary to add in the daughter’s age! To once again reinforce that statement, this was a 6 month old daughter!</p><p></p><p>Everything proceeded extremely smoothly, as if there was a god lending a helping hand.</p><p></p><p>“Found it!” Soft Feather was happy inside, and her palms joined together, “Sorry, sorry, I’m really sorry, I will definitely compensate you, but right now you must injure your leg and get hospitalized!”</p><p></p><p>When she joined her palms, there was a golden talisman flickering. Things like talismans were usually one-time/single use items, but there were also high-grade merchandise that could be reused many times.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, the one in Soft Feathers hands was a high-grade tool.</p><p></p><p>Only second generation cultivators like Soft Feather who had a rich father would waste high-grade talismans in this manner.</p><p></p><p>It wasn’t easy to make high-grade talismans. Although they could be repeatedly used, they still had a limit, the more it’s used, the sooner it breaks. When ordinary cultivators attain a high-grade talisman, they would even roll it up, make an incision and insert it into their body!</p><p></p><p>The gold talisman power began moving under Soft Feather’s control.</p><p></p><p>Far away, at the teachers’ apartment building.</p><p></p><p>While Teacher Renshui was asleep, a force suddenly pushed him, and he fell off the bed.</p><p></p><p>What was very unfortunate was, his leg was at an angle which it could easily get hurt.</p><p></p><p>Therefore…… *Crash!*</p><p></p><p>*Crack*, there was the sound of something twisting.</p><p></p><p>“Hiss!” Teacher Renshui woke up from the pain and groaned. He was immediately in cold sweat, and the sprained leg rapidly swelled up. But so as not to disturb his cute daughter who was sleeping, he tightly gripped onto the quilt/blanket, tightly clenched his teeth and sent his screams back to his stomach. Pity all the parents of the world.</p><p></p><p>With his teeth still clenched, Teacher Renshui quickly rubbed his ankle, he was obviously experienced. With a sprain of this level, there was no need to be hospitalized, he just needs to rub a little Hong Hua ointment and rest, and it should be fine the next day.</p><p></p><p>After rubbing for a while, Teacher Renshui stood on one leg, and hopped towards the refrigerator while leaning against the wall.</p><p></p><p>However…… Soft Feather’s magic hasn’t ended, her objective was to send this pitiful teacher into the hospital!</p><p></p><p>Teacher Renshui thought it was an accident that he fell off the bed and hurt his knee, he didn’t know that there was a mysterious force secretly trying to hurt his leg to the point of hospitalization being required. Meaning, he had no idea how dangerous it was for him to lean against the wall and hop on one leg. It was without doubt that this way of moving forward was incredibly suitable for him to hurt himself again.</p><p></p><p>Teacher Renshui hopped and hopped, and suddenly his hop missed.</p><p></p><p>*Crack*, this time it was the sound of bones breaking…… It was his perfectly fine leg, fractured. The injury this time was more serious than his injury on the other leg.</p><p></p><p>“*Hiss!*” Teacher Renshui crashed into the ground, with his eyes wide open, he sucked in a cool breath, this time he was in so much pain that tears appeared. A man’s tears do not easily fall, they only fall for heartbreaking matters.</p><p></p><p>He gazed upon his sprained leg, and his broken leg, and his eyes immediately turned moist.</p><p></p><p>But there was no choice other than to resign himself to bad luck.</p><p></p><p>After sucking in cool breaths for a while, he carefully took out his phone, and made a call to his lord wife, requesting backup. His lord wife was also a teacher at Jiang Nan University.</p><p></p><p>Because his daughter was around, it wasn’t a good idea for him to directly call for an ambulance. He has to wait for his wife to return, so that she can take care of his daughter while he is sent to the hospital.</p><p></p><p>When she heard her husband narrate the experience of ‘injuring the two legs’, Teacher Renshui’s wife felt worried, yet also felt that what happened was funny.</p><p></p><p>After hastily requesting leave for a single class, she rushed back home……</p><p></p><p>After Teacher Renshui ended his call with his lord wife, he made a call to the school management, requesting leave for his three classes tomorrow afternoon. With the condition his two legs were in, he definitely had to be hospitalized, and so he naturally had to let the school rearrange the classes.</p><p></p><p>“Done.” Soft Feather nodded with satisfaction, and stored her gold talisman.</p><p></p><p>With this, her objective has been completed.</p><p></p><p>Since Teacher Renshui requested for leave, tomorrow afternoon’s class would be cancelled.</p><p></p><p>If there aren’t classes tomorrow, Song Shuhang would be free.</p><p></p><p>If Shuhang is free, he can accompany her to J City.</p><p></p><p>Look! It really was that simple!</p><p></p><p>With the matter settled, Soft Feather was in a great mood.</p><p></p><p>After she returned into the room, she noticed that Song Shuhang was on the ticket booking website booking train tickets for her.</p><p></p><p>“Senior Song, how about you book a ticket for yourself as well. Perhaps you don’t have afternoon classes tomorrow?” Soft Feather moved forward, and gently prodded.</p><p></p><p>“Haha, if there truly aren’t classes I will book one more ticket.” Song Shuhang joked.</p><p></p><p>The moment he said that.</p><p></p><p>*Ding dong!*</p><p></p><p>At this time, the school’s email network suddenly had a popup.</p><p></p><p>“Mechanical Engineering Discipline, Machinery Designs and Manufacturing Faculty’s 19th department 43rd class’ students please take note: As Teacher Renshui is injured and hospitalized, tomorrow afternoon’s Mathematical Sciences Statistics class will be swapped with Professor Smith’s University English class. Please notify each other, and make the appropriate preparations! Thank you.”</p><p></p><p>This information was repeatedly broadcasted three times.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, it was set to be rebroadcasted once an hour.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Nan University’s management moves very fast, and works very efficiently! From the moment Teacher Renshui made a call requesting leave, till this message was sent, only a minute or two had passed!</p><p></p><p>“Huh? Teacher Renshui is injured? What a coincidence. However tomorrow’s lesson is changed to English class…… Do I have to attend that old-fashioned class taught by that old fellow Smith?” Song Shuhang muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>But Soft Feather, who stood by his side suddenly had her eyes moistened.</p><p></p><p>This was like kicking a ball one feet forward, only to have the goalpost shifted 10 feet away!</p><p></p><p>However, as someone who is from Spiritual Butterfly Island, she definitely can’t give up so easily.</p><p></p><p>Definitely not!  				</p>'),(26,2,'Chapter 16 This matter feels a tad abnormal',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 16: This matter feels a tad abnormal!</p><p></p><p>Since sending one teacher to the hospital is no big deal, why not send two!</p><p></p><p>Since I’ve already started something, I can’t give up halfway, this English teacher named Smith will be sent to the hospital too! Determination flashed in Soft Feather’s eyes……along with killing intent!</p><p></p><p>“Senior Song, is this Teacher Smith of yours a foreigner? What does he look like?” Soft Feather pretended to be curious as she asked.</p><p></p><p>“That fella? He’s an old-fashioned man, his standard of teaching is good, though.” Song Shuhang grinned as he said, then casually tapped on the name ‘Professor Smith’ in the message.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the face of an old English man with a rigid face and flawlessly combed hair popped out.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Nan University’s school network has a large information system, where as long as one has the required level of authority, all of the students’ and teachers’ information can be found.</p><p></p><p>“He looks so serious, does he also stay at the teachers’ apartments?” Soft Feather nervously asked.</p><p></p><p>“Yep, that’s right.” Song Shuhang didn’t think much of itas he nodded, and continued to key in the particulars of Soft Feather’s identity card. He then registered and prepared to book the tickets.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather felt embarrassed as she smiled, and quietly walked back to the balcony. She once again put on the magical tool: Desiring Thousand Miles Eyes, Take It Up A Notch.</p><p></p><p>Very soon, she located her target.</p><p>[TL: I’ve got you in my sights. – Soldier 76]</p><p></p><p>As of that moment, Professor Smith was out on a walk with his dog, by the school’s river</p><p></p><p>“Strange, is there a cold wind blowing?” Suddenly, this rigid old Englishman tightened his collar. He felt a mysterious chill, and was baffled.</p><p></p><p>“Sorry, sorry. Just like Teacher Renshui, after I’m done with my matters, I will compensate you.” Soft Feather again mumbled, then her hands rubbed the gold talisman.</p><p></p><p>At the school’s river……</p><p></p><p>The rigid Englishman felt that his condition today wasn’t good, and spontaneously decided to return to the hostel and rest, “Ham, let’s go back. Perfect timing, I still have to prepare the contents for tomorrow’s class.”</p><p></p><p>Having said that, Professor Smith pulled on the dog’s leash.</p><p></p><p>“Wu……Wu!” At this time, his normally obedient pet dog suddenly howled, while its eyes turned completely red.</p><p></p><p>Professor Smith felt a tremendous force coming from the dog’s leash. Ham the little puppy usually follows obediently with a gentle pull, yet today it fiercely pulled the leash.</p><p></p><p>Professor Smith frowned, then used more force to pull on the dog’s leash.</p><p></p><p>“Wang!” The pet dog indeed followed the dog leash as it returned, but it returned pouncing with red eyes! His mouth ferociously opened, targeting the Englishman’s skinny calf, and fiercely bit down on it.</p><p></p><p>“Oh, no! Help! Help me!” At the riverside, Professor Smith’s screams resounded.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>15 minutes later.</p><p></p><p>At the affiliated hospital close to Jiang Nan University, in a room with two beds.</p><p></p><p>Teacher Renshui was lying in bed, both his legs dangled high, showing an extremely shameful posture. His wife held their child, while she displayed an expression of not knowing whether to laugh or to cry.</p><p></p><p>Right at this time, the ward’s door was opened, and a rigid-looking Englishman was pushed into the ward.</p><p></p><p>“Huh? Professor Smith? Aren’t you supposed to substitute me for tomorrow afternoon’s class? What happened?” Teacher Renshui was surprised and questioned him.</p><p></p><p>The Englishman spoke with clear Mandarin as he angrily said, “I was…… bitten by Ham. Ss, it’s the dog I’m raising. The doctor said it bit too hard, and hurt the bone. Ss, I have to be hospitalized. When I’m discharged tomorrow I will slaughter it and turn it into stew! Ss……”</p><p></p><p>It seemed like this rigid old Englishman was deeply hurt emotionally by the puppy he was raising. He felt that that dog was a practically a white-eyed wolf that cannot be domesticated. It so fiercely bit onto him, and nearly wanted his old life. Stew, it must be stewed!</p><p>[TL: White-eyed wolf means ungrateful person.]</p><p></p><p>“……” Teacher Renshui felt that the events of today were a tad abnormal!</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>At the dormitory, Song Shuhang had already booked a train ticket for Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the school’s email network once again broadcasted a new message.</p><p></p><p>“Mechanical Engineering Discipline, Machinery Designs and Manufacturing Faculty’s 19th department 43rd class’ students please take note: As Professor Smith is injured and hospitalized, tomorrow afternoon’s University English class is cancelled. Mechanical Engineering Discipline, Machinery Designs and Manufacturing Faculty’s 19th department 43rd class’ students are to have a half-day break tomorrow afternoon. Please notify each other, and make the appropriate preparations! Thank you.”</p><p></p><p>Likewise, this message was broadcasted three times in a row.</p><p></p><p>Moreover it was set to be rebroadcasted every half an hour, so as to cover up the previous message.</p><p></p><p>“……” Song Shuhang looked at this short message, in his mind thousands of grass mud horses crazily galloped across.</p><p>[TL: Grass mud horse is how the chinese say ‘F**k your mother’ on the internet, they sound almost the same.]</p><p></p><p>He turned around to look at Soft Feather who had a flowery smile. He felt that the things that happened today are a tad abnormal!</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>In the end Shuhang still had to go along with Soft Feather to J City; because he no longer had a reason not to accompany Soft Feather for this trip.</p><p></p><p>He truly didn’t expect for the two professors to be sent to the hospital one after another. The probabilities of this were practically the same as winning the top prize in a lottery, yet he somehow managed to strike it? Due to the tragic encounters of the two professors, he had a whole day of free time tomorrow. Therefore, under Soft Feather’s expectant gaze, he booked two train tickets to J City.</p><p></p><p>The ticket number was the one right after Soft Feather’s, therefore it was the seat immediately next to hers.</p><p></p><p>“Hey Soft Feather, for the two professors to be hospitalized in succession, do you think it is a coincidence?” Shuhang unyieldingly stared at Soft Feather without blinking. These were eyes that could kill, using an oppressive air to force the enemy to confess. Under this fierce gaze, the one getting stared at would feel uneasy if they lied.</p><p></p><p>The matters today were indeed excessively coincidental. A professor was sent to a hospital, while another professor substituted for the class, and in less than three minutes that professor too was abruptly sent to the hospital. What kind of bullshit story line was this?</p><p></p><p>Shuhang had long thought that he had passed the age of delusions and fantasies. Wuxia dreams, Xianxia dreams and so on should have left his life a long time ago. But right now, he truly suspected that Soft Feather had some special abilities, abilities that had somehow caused the two professors to be hospitalized.</p><p></p><p>When he opened his mind, he even thought towards the side of evil; this young lady is actually the young mistress of a terrifying dark organization, like in the movies, she has a large bunch of people following her in secret, and ready to fulfill whatever she wishes. Then, because she wanted him to accompany to her to J City, those covert subordinates ruthlessly sent the two professors to the hospital?</p><p></p><p>Yet upon receiving this death stare from Song Shuhang, Soft Feather instead wore a unperturbed expression, “How can that be? Ah am not the kind to do such things, right? Senior Song, you must believe ah!”</p><p>[TL: I’m just using Ah as a slang for I, Soft Feather is using a countryside slang in that sentence.]</p><p></p><p>Her innocent eyes were like a sacred lake that has never been tainted by anybody, but…… Where did that ‘Ah’ slang come from?</p><p></p><p>Luckily, Shuhang didn’t continue pursuing this topic, he just felt that all these events were too surprising, and casually asked.</p><p></p><p>“We will set off at approximately 3.10PM in the afternoon, and will be able to arrive at Jiang Nan University Station at 3.30PM. Since we still have some time, why not you make use of it by looking up the internet for information regarding ‘Ghost Lamp Temple’? I’ll go purchase lunch for us both, is there anything you can’t eat?” Song Shuhang asked.</p><p></p><p>“Nope, I can eat anything.” Soft Feather answered. At this moment, in order to conceal the uneasiness in her heart, even if her most hated green peppers appeared in front of her, she would dump them straight into her mouth!</p><p></p><p>“Then you try your best to find Ghost Lamp Temple, I’ll be back in a jiffy. If before that my roommates return, just tell them you’re my friend.” Song Shuhang waved his hand as he went out the door.</p><p></p><p>After Song Shuhang left, Soft Feather guiltily cringed in front of the computer, then continued to research all of the temples in the Luo Xin Street of J City, going through them one by one.</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>June 2nd, at 3PM in the afternoon.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang’s 3 roommates had received the school’s email notification, so they didn’t return to the dormitory today.</p><p></p><p>“Soft Feather, it’s time to go.” Song Shuhang called out.</p><p></p><p>“Coming.” Soft Feather stood up in front of the computer, crestfallen.</p><p></p><p>She had researched for half a day, yet still didn’t manage to find any information regarding Ghost Lamp Temple. Meanwhile, it was unknown what happened to North River’s Loose Practitioner as he didn’t come online for the whole afternoon.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang put the stuff he bought from the Foodie Paradise into the fridge, then wrote a simple note for his three roommates, mentioning that there was food in the fridge for them to eat.</p><p></p><p>For this trip he brought a sling bag. Inside, he placed his phone, power bank and charger. It was unknown how long this trip would take, if his phone runs out of battery things could become extremely troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather pulled her large suitcase along while following Shuhang out.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang saw how dejected she was, and asked, “Couldn’t find Ghost Lamp Temple?”</p><p></p><p>“There’s completely zero information, I don’t even know if it has changed its name or has been torn down. Right now there is only the option of going to J City and asking the locals there.” Soft Feather said gloomily.</p><p></p><p>“When the boat gets to the pier-head it will naturally straighten itself, let’s get there first.”</p><p></p><p>The two spoke as they walked, and took the elevator down.</p><p></p><p>As it was 3PM in the afternoon, the number of people in the dormitory gradually increased, and the boarding students from the various disciplines began returning to school.</p><p></p><p>“Ah Hang, where are you going to play~” Approaching was Shuhang’s classmates greeting while waving their hands. Soon, their attention was stolen by Soft Feather who was behind Song Shuhang.</p><p></p><p>What a tall beauty!  				</p>'),(27,2,'Chapter 17 Investigation for Ghost Lamp Temple',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 17: Investigation for Ghost Lamp Temple</p><p></p><p>“Hehe, sending my elder sister back, and having fun with her along the way. Our teachers are on leave, so we could play for one more day.” Shuhang intentionally attached importance to the two words ‘elder sister’ as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between him and Soft Feather must be presented clearly.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with this bunch of gossipers, the entire faculty will have knowledge of Song Shuhang having a girlfriend who has a figure that is even more tyrannical than models.</p><p></p><p>That way, his, Song Shuhang’s innocence will be lost. He wanted to take advantage of the fact that he was in university to find a girlfriend and end the virginity of his body, and that would become difficult.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he also wanted to retaliate against the identity of a ‘senior’ that Soft Feather gave him. He’s only 18-years young, yet he was being called a senior over and over by a lady. Are you asking for a beating!</p><p></p><p>“Erm erm, it’s your sister huh, Shuhang?” The guys from the same dormitory’s eyes shone, in their hearts they all thought of the same thing; Shuhang, aren’t we friends?</p><p></p><p>If we could evolve once more from this term called ‘friends’ and become Shuhang’s brother-in-law that would be even better!</p><p></p><p>“We’re leaving now, see you!” Shuhang laughed out loud, and didn’t give these fellas the chance to meet and greet, he waved goodbye, then charismatically left.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather smiled as she waved towards those guys too, and quickly followed Song Shuhang out of the males’ dormitory.</p><p></p><p>“This brat Shuhang actually has such a beautiful sister. I’ve decided, from tomorrow onwards Shuhang is my bro, I’ll take good care of him.” Someone joked.</p><p></p><p>“You want to be Shuhang’s brother-in-law even more, right?” Another person bantered.</p><p></p><p>“Be careful for you might not just fail at becoming his elder brother-in-law, you might instead become Shuhang’s little brother-in-law. I remember you have a pretty elder sister at home too yo.”</p><p></p><p>“Tch, if Shuhang’s willing to introduce his sister to me, I’ll immediately sell my sister to him. I’ll even sell one and give another for free!”</p><p></p><p>The guys joked about as they returned to the dormitory.</p><p></p><p>After all, she may be stunning, but which modern person hasn’t experienced a baptism of beauties on the internet? Who would still have the pure heart for love at first sight?</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>Check-in is at 3.30PM, while the train leaves at 4PM.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather took the window seat, while Song Shuhang sat beside her.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, when he got onto the train with Soft Feather, Song Shuhang suddenly thought of the few Modern genre novels he read recently.</p><p></p><p>In those, whenever the male lead goes out with the female lead, it doesn’t matter whether it’s driving a sports car, taking the metro/subway, sitting the bus, or even riding a bicycle, there would always be a mean actor backstage that takes fancy to the beauty of the female lead, and would come up to provoke them.</p><p></p><p>Possessing supreme skills, the male lead will naturally be in the limelight, and will deal with the mean actor in various harsh ways. Then the mean actor will take off, with hatred in his heart. Without the guts to openly deal with the male lead, he secretly prepares various evil schemes.</p><p></p><p>Then there will be all kinds of enmity and retaliation.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang resigned himself to the fact that he wasn’t like those male leads, however the beauty of Soft Feather beside him shouldn’t be beneath those female leads in the modern novels. Therefore, Song Shuhang thought, will there be some kickass dude that appears wanting to know a beauty, who will then provoke him in various ways?</p><p></p><p>When that happens…… Should he kill that person to prevent future troubles? Or should he just beat him till he’s half dead?</p><p></p><p>It’s a pity that novels are just novels. In reality, perhaps there are those rampant and brainless mean actors, but there are too few. They are as rare as giant pandas, and aren’t easy to meet.</p><p></p><p>On the slow two-hour train ride, there simply wasn’t a single person who came to provoke Shuhang, and nobody who tried to approach Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>This made Shuhang feel a little disappointed……</p><p></p><p>Half an hour through the journey, Soft Feather was sleepy, and fell asleep in the seat. Not long later, her body leaned to the side, and her head rested on Shuhang’s shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang could only relax his shoulders to let the lady sleep more comfortably.</p><p></p><p>The two hours of the train journey passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>“Ding ding ding~~ Hello travelers, the train has arrived at Black Elephant Station, please do not forget your belongings, and exit from the train from the doors on the right. When alighting, please mind the gap.”</p><p></p><p>“We’ve arrived.” Song Shuhang lightly patted Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>In a daze, Soft Feather opened her eyes, while rubbing her eyes, there was clear saliva flowing from the corner of her mouth, “Is it morning?”</p><p></p><p>Moe, he actually felt moe from a girl who looked older than him.</p><p></p><p>“The train has reached the station, let’s quickly get off.” Song Shuhang pulled her hand and dragged along the heavy suitcase out of the train’s carriage.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>Only after the train whistled away did Soft Feather truly wake up.</p><p></p><p>“Senior, what time is it?”</p><p></p><p>“It’s 6.07PM in the evening, we’re already at J City’s Black Elephant Station, when we get out we can directly take a taxi to Luo Xin Street, then we’ll first find a place to stay there.” Song Shuhang answered.</p><p></p><p>“Alright, I’ll follow Senior’s arrangements.” Soft Feather nodded…… This is what she likes the most! Having someone plan where to eat, drink and stay for her, and all she needs to do is to follow the arrangements. She doesn’t even need to work her brain, this feeling was true happiness.</p><p></p><p>There was a taxi stand at Black Elephant Station, and there were many taxi’s awaiting customers.</p><p></p><p>“Hey man, where to?” A taxi stopped beside Song Shuhang and Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>“Luo Xin Street.” Song Shuhang opened the door to the front passenger seat as he answered.</p><p></p><p>“J City’s Luo Xin Street!” Soft Feather added on, this lady was traumatised by Jiang Nan region’s Luo Xin Street.</p><p></p><p>The taxi driver was first stunned, then casually smiled, “Haha, you’re an amusing lady.”</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather knew she made a joke out of herself, and blushed.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>J City’s Luo Xin Street was very close to the Black Elephant Train Station, and was a mere 10 minute car journey.</p><p></p><p>After the two got off the taxi, using the phone’s GPS they found a hotel to temporarily stay at. As the two of them weren’t husband and wife, there wasn’t even a need to think of something romantic like sharing a room.</p><p></p><p>Even if Song Shuhang wanted to, and Soft Feather doesn’t reject, the hotel’s boss might not agree! In this day and age, things are too strict. If something bad happens, the hotel has to bear a part of the responsibility.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, taking advantage of the fact that it was still relatively bright, the two prepared to stroll around Luo Xin Street to look for Ghost Lamp Temple.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather had to first deposit her suitcase into the room. Shuhang didn’t have such a need, so he waited by the front desk after receiving the card.</p><p></p><p>There weren’t many guests today, so the receptionist lady wasn’t busy.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang seized this opportunity to ask, “Excuse me, I would like to ask if there’s a place called Ghost Lamp Temple in Luo Xin Street?</p><p></p><p>The receptionist lady pondered for a while, then shook her head, “My apologies mister, there are quite a number of temples in Luo Xin Street, but I’ve never heard of Ghost Lamp Temple.”</p><p></p><p>For a temple with such a unique name, if it existed there was no way she would have never heard of it before.</p><p></p><p>“Then are there similarly named temples? Perhaps it might not be called Ghost Lamp Temple, it might be called Ghost Ascending Temple, Scholar Lamp Temple, Returning Seat Temple, anything is possible.” Shuhang continued asking.</p><p>[TL: All of these sound similar to Ghost Lamp Temple in Chinese.]</p><p></p><p>Right now the internet is so well developed, yet a trace of a clue to the temple cannot even be found, perhaps the name was something else entirely that sounds similar.</p><p></p><p>The receptionist lady conscientiously thought for a long time, then once again shook her head, “Sorry, I’m afraid I can’t help you. Perhaps it’s a temple from a long time ago, if mister truly wants to find it, you may attempt asking the elderly in Luo Xin Street.”</p><p></p><p>“Thank you.” Said Song Shuhang while nodding.</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, Soft Feather already came out of her room.</p><p></p><p>“Where are we going to next?” She asked.</p><p></p><p>“Let’s randomly stroll around, our primary aim is to look for groups of elderly chatting idly, and see if we can get some information from them.”</p><p></p><p>While the two chatted, they left the hotel.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>Right as the two left the hotel, in the hotel’s lounge, a lady with a grave expression took out her phone, “Altar Master, I’m at Luo Xin Glory Hotel and saw someone looking for information regarding Ghost Lamp Temple. One man and one woman, they look approximately 20 years old or so.”</p><p></p><p>“Has what should have come finally arrived……. How strong are they?” On the line, a cold and indifferent voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>“The woman appears to be very strong, while the man looks like an ordinary person. However, the woman treats him with incredible respect, and privately addresses him as her senior.” Answered the lady.</p><p></p><p>“How strong?” That voice remained unflustered and cold.</p><p></p><p>“Your subordinate can’t make it out at all, and could only feel that she’s very strong.”</p><p></p><p>“I understand. Continue monitoring their movements, do not let them discover you. I will attempt to probe their limits. In addition, tell the members at the other monitoring points to keep their guards up, we can’t say for sure that these two are the only ones looking for Ghost Lamp Temple.”</p><p>“Affirmative.” The lady closed her phone and quickly walked out of the hotel, walking in the direction Song Shuhang and Soft Feather had left.  				</p>'),(28,2,'Chapter 18 Meeting familiar faces in another place',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 18: Meeting familiar faces in another place</p><p></p><p>A man covered the phone on the other end of the call. His face was cold and remote, but the hand grasping the phone shook slightly.</p><p></p><p>It had been sixty years. He also knew that the original owner of the Ghost Lamp Temple had a domineering strength and wouldn’t die that easily. However, it’d been sixty years. He felt that perhaps the original owner of the Ghost Lamp Temple no longer cared about this area.</p><p></p><p>So, he began to make his preparations and surreptitiously tried to break through the seal on the sides of the Ghost Lamp Temple to obtain what was inside.</p><p></p><p>He hadn’t thought that someone would still come looking for it in the end.</p><p></p><p>“Damn it!” The man ground his teeth.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>After they had walked out from the hotel, Shuhang and Soft Feather started aimlessly shopping around the Luo Xin Streets.</p><p></p><p>They didn’t run into any groups of chitchatting elders, but ran into something far more interesting — five drunk perverts.</p><p></p><p>He didn’t run into the circumstances of ‘femme fatale’ on the train, but he hadn’t thought that after arriving on the Luo Xin Streets, he’d bump into the plot line of a bunch of drunk perverts forming lascivious intentions after seeing a pretty girl.</p><p></p><p>It was a sparsely populated small alleyway where the five drunks swayed as they blocked Song Shuhang and Soft Feather’s way. Five pairs of eyes were bloodshot as they stared greedily at Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>Alcohol could bolster a hero’s courage and does the same for petty characters. None of the acts that people could commit whilst under the influence were worth goggling about. They could do anything from kissing female pigs, biting dogs, and slugging it out with each other.</p><p></p><p>The five drunks had never seen such a beautiful lass in their lives. They couldn’t move their eyes away after seeing Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>“Hot damn! This woman is as beautiful as a fairy. If I can have a round with her, I’m down even if I lose ten years of my life!” These were their thoughts and so they surrounded Soft Feather and Song Shuhang, using their inebriation as an excuse.</p><p></p><p>What were they afraid of? In the worst case, they would just spend a few years in jail.</p><p></p><p>This was the pathetic part of not understanding the law. They’d only vaguely heard people mention it in passing boasts that forcing themselves on girls would result in a few years in jail. Did they think that the times now were still those of a few years ago, or that this was India?</p><p></p><p>These days, forcing themselves on a girl meant a life sentence. If the situation was a bit worse off, it’d mean a bullet to the head.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when he saw this scene. He loosened up his joints and prepared to fight.</p><p></p><p>His fighting abilities weren’t bad… he could easily take three at a time usually, not to mention these five skinny drunkards in front of him. It was precisely because of this that the thugs around school didn’t bother him.</p><p></p><p>He could take on ten of these kinds of opponents!</p><p></p><p>Just as Song Shuhang was about to demonstrate his punches and kicks, a breeze whistled past his ears.</p><p></p><p>He then saw a pair of slender legs kick out repeatedly as fast as lightning. When those legs kicked in the air, it was as if butterflies were flitting through the shrubbery. It posed a wonderfully beautiful sight. Not only did it look pretty, its power was even more frightening. When the pair of legs moved through the air, even the snaps like a whip cracking through air were emitted.</p><p></p><p>The five drunkards released shrill yells and flew out backwards, spasming crazily on the ground and vomiting everywhere, falling unconscious after a short while.</p><p></p><p>Faceplanting onto the ground? How long did it take? A second? Or even shorter?!</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang turned his head back and saw Soft Feather retract her long legs — that was damned awesome alright?!</p><p></p><p>Compared to Soft Feather, his punches and kicks were seriously child’s play.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the unconscious drunks, Shuhang suddenly recalled the youths who had collectively lost consciousness outside the school.</p><p></p><p>If, and he was only hypothesizing here, with the battle strength that Soft Feather had just demonstrated, it seemed that she could indeed have sent those seven, eight, or ten thugs kissing the ground in a short amount of time that day?</p><p></p><p>However, Soft Feather had been on the plane then.</p><p></p><p>Could the Su Clan’s Ah Shiliu in the chat group really have done it? Could it be that those within the chat group all had off the charts battle strength?</p><p></p><p>“Are they dead?” Song Shuhang was a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>“Don’t worry senior, I know the proper limits. They’ll be out for two days at most before waking up. This timing is perfect, as not eating or drinking for three days easily results in problems.” Soft Feather answered.</p><p></p><p>These answers gave Song Shuhang a feeling of sudden enlightenment — those thugs who still remained in their coma, was it because the deadline of ‘two days’ had yet to arrive?</p><p></p><p>“Let’s go, senior.” Soft Feather giggled.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang nodded his head stiffly due to his mind being a chaotic mess. He left the alleyway with Soft Feather…</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>After Shuhang and Soft Feather had been gone for quite a while, a man strode over with steady steps from a corner behind the alleyway, making his way to the five drunkards.</p><p></p><p>“Drunkards are indeed too weak. They couldn’t even make the two bring their true strength to bear.” The man sighed.</p><p></p><p>A figure clothed in black knelt on the ground behind the man, spoke in a low voice, “Altar Master, do you need us to send a few people to test them?”</p><p></p><p>“No need. These five drunkards were only ordinary people. This is why the pair had held back when they made their moves. If our people made an appearance… they may not act with mercy.” The Altar Master spoke quietly. Each of his underlings had been cultivated with care and effort. Even training an ordinary rookie would require more than one million yuan, they weren’t expendable goods that he would easily dispose without thought.</p><p></p><p>The girl had made a move to teach these five drunks a lesson just now. The level of her strength had been subtly discernible. The legs audibly whipping through air and easy control over her power, this wasn’t something that someone of the first rank mortal ascension level could do.</p><p></p><p>Their opponent was someone who had coalesced true qi!</p><p></p><p>This wasn’t a level of existence that his underlings could contend against.</p><p></p><p>Besides, there was another “senior” beside the girl with an unfathomable depth that even he couldn’t probe.</p><p></p><p>These opponents could easily use their variety of skills to destroy the elites that he’d spent a great deal of money to train. Even if he had a lot of underlings, it wouldn’t do to waste them like this.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he had been a bit frightened.</p><p></p><p>“We can only bide our time and wait for the right moment.” The Altar Master murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>He’d already lost most of his hope towards attaining the treasure within the Ghost Lamp Temple, he just wasn’t quite willing to call it quits yet.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather and Song Shuhang ambled around Luo Xin Street for another half day, meeting up with an elder that was fifty some years old, but no one knew of the Ghost Lamp Temple.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang felt his head ache. He hadn’t thought that even looking for a temple would be this much of a hassle. “Soft Feather, are you sure that the Ghost Lamp Temple is within the Luo Xin Street of J City?”</p><p></p><p>“It is absolutely here and I haven’t remembered the name incorrectly either. Ghost as in ghosts and monsters, lamp as in what’s used to light the way!” Soft Feather spoke resolutely. “My mother brought me here when she was carrying me, but I could only use father’s arts to observe the outside world with my consciousness. All I remember is the Ghost Lamp Temple plaque made from wood.”</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang could understand the first half of her words, but didn’t know where she’d traveled off to with the second part. His thoughts and hers were obviously in different dimensions.</p><p></p><p>“Then were there any places of interest nearby? The top of a mountain perhaps? Halfway up a mountain? Or a small creek maybe?” Shuhang asked.</p><p></p><p>“Not a mountain, it should’ve been flat ground. I don’t really remember anything else.” Soft Feather said with some embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>“Does Senior North River happen to have any news?”</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather fished out her cellphone to take a look and said with joy, “Senior North River is online.”</p><p></p><p>Within the Nine Provinces (1) Chat Group.</p><p></p><p>North River Loose Practitioner: “Soft Feather, have you already found the Ghost Lamp Temple?”</p><p></p><p>“Not yet, does senior have any news?” Soft Feather entered the message happily.</p><p></p><p>“Apologies, I asked some comrades around here, but all the people I know are on the eastern side of Huaxia. No one knows anything about the J City area.” North River Loose Practitioner sent a ruefully smiling emoticon: “And, a thorny fellow has just arrived and is still clinging onto me. I’m afraid I won’t be of much help from now on.”</p><p></p><p>“No worries, senior, please take care of your business.” Soft Feather smiled and responded.</p><p></p><p>When Shuhang saw these messages, he immediately felt that this North River Loose Practitioner… was a man who couldn’t be relied on. He was online every second of the day when he wasn’t needed, but something would draw his attention away as soon as he was needed!</p><p></p><p>“Senior Song, we’re on our own!” Soft Feather formed a fist and made a “fighting!” gesture.</p><p></p><p>So cute and girly! For reasons unknown to him, Song Shuhang somehow felt that this woman who looked older than him looked so cute and girly.</p><p></p><p>A blinding row of headlights lit up the street as they were talking. A row of brightly colored motorcycles revved their engines and charged towards Shuhang. It was apparent from the loud sound of their engines that these bikes had all been modified.</p><p></p><p>“Bikers? What age is this?” Song Shuhang murmured to himself and pulled Soft Feather towards the side of the street.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather’s eyes lit up when she heard the words “bikers”, “Should we finish them off?”</p><p></p><p>“Eh?” Song Shuhang was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>“Shouldn’t bikers all be in jail? Knock them out and send them to jail!” Soft Feather rubbed her fists and wiped her palms, eager for action.</p><p></p><p>“…” Girl, you make a lot of sense. I actually have no words for you.</p><p></p><p>However, Soft Feather didn’t make a move in the end.</p><p></p><p>When the seven or eight bikes passed by Shuhang and Soft Feather, one of them braked suddenly and made a beautiful U-turn, coming to a stop next to Shuhang.</p><p></p><p>Opening the visor of the motorcycle’s helmet, a handsome face with dashing eyebrows and bright eyes was revealed. “Shuhang! What are you doing here, kid?”  				</p>'),(29,2,'Chapter 19 Ghost Lamp Temple 50 years ago',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 19: Ghost Lamp Temple 50 years ago</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang stared blankly at first, until he recognised who the man riding the bike was. He immediately became delighted, “Bo Zai? Why is it you? What’re you doing here?”</p><p></p><p>This good-looking boy was one of his three classmates Bo Zai. Bo Zai had a handsome appearance and an entirely uncharacteristically garbage name. His surname was Lin, so his full name was Lin Tubo.</p><p></p><p>Bo Zai has hated this name for more than 10 years, he felt that this name was lame to the point of being garbage. Because of this name, he and his father have fought for many years. There was even a time where he brought his passport and ID card to the related department to change his name. In the end, when his father found out, he dragged him home, and gave him a good beating.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, whenever Bo Zai met someone, he would ask them to call him Ah Bo, Little Bo or Bo Zai.</p><p></p><p>In reality, in Shuhang’s point of view, Tu Bo’s name could still be considered a tolerable one. Compared to others like Wang Erdan (Idiot Wang) and Liu Gousheng (Leftover Dogshit), his name was certainly much better. Don’t think of names like “Dogshit” as merely a joke. In Shuhang’s old home, there was someone who bore that name; however, that guy’s surname was Wang so he was called Wang Gousheng (Dogshit).</p><p></p><p>All along, Wang Gousheng had thought that he was actually not related to his father by blood, he even thought that his father bore a grudge against him. Otherwise, how could he possibly have been given such a name?</p><p></p><p>To get back onto topic, Shuhang had never thought that he would meet Bo Zai here.</p><p></p><p>“My grandpa lives in J City. This week, my whole family is over at my grandpa’s place. But what about you? Why are you running around in J City?” Bo Zai was speaking when he suddenly saw the long-legged beauty standing beside Shuhang. Instantly, he clapped his left palm with his right fist. He understood now. It seems like this fella, Shuhang, brought his girl here to play!</p><p></p><p>“Tsk tsk, Shuhang you don’t seem like it but your introverted exterior actually hides such a playboy? There was no word at all of you hooking up with such a gorgeous beauty. Next time, you definitely have to treat me to a meal.” Bo Zai laughed nastily.</p><p></p><p>Facing Bo Zai’s teasing, Song Shuhang was indifferent, without any telltale signs of being affected he said, “Don’t try to tease blindly, if she’s really my girlfriend I would burn incense to thank the heavens. This is my elder sister, Soft Feather. She wanted to come to J City to look for a place called Ghost Lamp Temple, but doesn’t know the way, which is why I’m accompanying her here.</p><p></p><p>“Really?” Tu Bo gazed intently at Shuhang.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang shrugged. Beside him, Soft Feather smiled sweetly.</p><p></p><p>“Heh, fine. If you say she’s your sister, then she’s your sister.” Tu Bo was not a gossip-monger. “Earlier you said you were looking for some temple? Have you found it?”</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang shook his head, “We’ve searched online for a long time but couldn’t find anything, which is why we came down here to Luo Xin Street to see if anybody knows. However, even the hotel receptionist had never heard of Ghost Lamp Temple. We don’t even know if it changed its name or has been torn down, so we intend to find and ask some elderly locals, perhaps there might be clues by doing so.”</p><p></p><p>“If that’s the case… why don’t you visit my place? We could ask my grandpa and see. My grandpa is a proper born-and-bred J City resident, perhaps he’ll know of that Ghost-Something Temple you’re looking for. Tsk, what a miserable name; a temple with that kind of name definitely won’t many visitors. It’s probably already closed down!” Tu Bo clicked his tongue, he had vehement hatred for bad names.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang’s heart was gleeful, but he had to ask, “Will we be disturbing your family’s vacation?”</p><p></p><p>“Rest assured, my grandpa is great with guests. As for my father, he strongly wants me to study with other students instead of doing random things. I’m already in college, yet he wants me to study all day, it’s driving me crazy.” Tubo chuckled as he said.</p><p></p><p>Even though his words painted a depressing picture, their father and son relationship could be considered pretty good. The only problem was his father liked to beat people up. His father strongly believed that a wooden cane produces a well-educated child. His favourite phrase that he used to hang beside his mouth all the time was, “When it’s raining, it’s time to beat up the kids. There’s nothing better to do anyway.” This was quite a pain in Tubo’s ass.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Tubo asked, “Shuhang, do you know how to ride a motorcycle?”</p><p></p><p>“I do, but I don’t have a license.” Shuhang replied.</p><p></p><p>“It doesn’t matter, at a remote place like this, who would go through the trouble of checking people’s driving license?” Tubo laughed loudly, then turned around and called out, “Ah Tong, lend him your motorcycle for a while, you can ride with someone else for now!”</p><p></p><p>“Sure!” A big and buff guy got off his bike and stopped it in front of Song Shuhang.</p><p></p><p>“Thank you.” Shuhang smiled.</p><p></p><p>Ah Tong charismatically waved his hand, and rode pillion with one of his comrades.</p><p></p><p>Within the blink of an eye, the large swarm of people had their bikes roaring as they rode into the distance with a loud rumble.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang got onto the black motorcycle, and got a feel of it. He turned the throttled a little, and felt the body of the bike ferociously roar.</p><p></p><p>“This fella has been modified?” Shuhang braked and stopped the bike, smiling.</p><p></p><p>“All of these guys’ bikes have been personally modified by me. Their horsepower has been increased multiple times.” Tubo smirked.</p><p></p><p>He had forgotten that this fella is a tech otaku and skillful with his hands. Although it wasn’t to the point of being able to single-handedly build a Gundam, he’s still able to produce various interesting mechanical products.</p><p></p><p>“Soft Feather, get on the bike.” Shuhang turned around and called to Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>It was lucky that she had left her huge luggage back at the hotel. Otherwise, how would they bring it along on such a small bike?</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather straddled onto the bike, sitting behind Shuhang. Her soft breasts pressed onto Shuhang’s back, causing Soft Feather to feel soft in the legs.</p><p></p><p>In front of them, Tubo laughed. “Follow me!”</p><p></p><p>Amidst the rumbling of the engines, two bikes shot into the distance one after the other.</p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>Tubo’s grandpa is a very modern old man, and he also liked to tinker with things like engines. This hobby of Tubo’s seems to have been inherited from his grandpa.</p><p></p><p>Because he is very modern, he easily gets along with young people.</p><p></p><p>“Ghost Lamp Temple? You mean there are still youngsters who know of that place?” Tubo’s grandpa laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>When Shuhang heard him say that, he knew that something was definitely up!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he asked, “Ah Ye, do you know where the Ghost Lamp temple is?”</p><p></p><p>Ah Ye was what the residents of Jiang Nan region, J City and the surrounding area liked to call grandfathers and elders of that age.</p><p></p><p>“Nowadays not many people know of that place, it’s from over 60 years ago. Most of those who know of it has entered a coffin, which is why most of you younglings don’t know of it.” Tubo’s grandpa brought everybody to the courtyard, and pointed towards a place in the east saying, “Keep going east, and you’ll find a forest around 700 metres in. After you enter it, you will find a large tomb, that is where Ghost Lamp Temple originally was.”</p><p></p><p>“Old tomb? Ghost Lamp Temple is a tomb?” Shuhang unconsciously asked a silly question.</p><p></p><p>“Ghost Lamp Temple has been destroyed?” Soft Feather’s eyes widened as she caught the main gist.</p><p></p><p>“Indeed. More than sixty years ago, it was bulldozed by some guy who constructed a giant tomb for himself.” Tubo’s grandpa replied.</p><p></p><p>So it was something that happened sixty years ago. At that time, not even televisions were widespread yet. It wasn’t like the current internet age where any tiny matter could be blown so out of proportion that everyone has heard of it.</p><p></p><p>Which is why there was simply no news regarding Ghost Lamp Temple. Only some of the elderly living in the local area knew what happened that year, so there weren’t many young people who knew about it.</p><p></p><p>“But, as far as I know, Ghost Lamp Temple is private property, isn’t it? Many years ago, didn’t someone already purchase it?” Soft Feather raised a doubt.</p><p></p><p>“You know quite a lot, little lady.” Tubo’s grandpa reminisced, “In reality…… at that time Ghost Lamp Temple’s land belonged to Trickster Huang, also known as tomb owner Huang Dagen. More than sixty years ago, he sold that Ghost Lamp Temple to a foreigner. But even before he sold it, he had already prepared to convert the Ghost Lamp Temple into a tomb. It just so happened that this foreigner came and offered to buy the temple. Therefore, Huang Dagen took advantage of this and sold the Ghost Lamp temple to him. However, several years later, when he saw that the foreigner never returned again, he had no qualms about building his own tomb on top of the Ghost Lamp temple.”</p><p></p><p>“So shameless?” Said Song Shuhang.</p><p></p><p>Tubo’s grandpa sighed then said, “The fella Trickster Huang is indeed shameless, the number of foreigners who were cheated by him in those years were many. There’s nothing that can be done about it, those foreigners were all silly and rich.”</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang quietly glanced at Soft Feather——He was guessing that the one who bought Ghost Lamp Temple was very possibly Soft Feather’s elder.</p><p></p><p>However, there wasn’t an expression of anger on Soft Feather’s face. There was only a sigh, and she said, “Then, that guy named Trickster Huang should already be dead, right?”</p><p></p><p>These words, gave people chills.  				</p>'),(30,2,'Chapter 20 Spirit Ghost',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 20: Spirit Ghost</p><p></p><p>“Little girl, how do you know of this?” Tubo’s grandpa asked curiously. “Indeed, since the time that Trickster Huang constructed the tomb, seven days after he hung up the tombstone, he died. And then, one after another… within the span of a year, all of the ten-plus members of his family were wiped out. Everyone in the district was saying that there was something supernatural about it. They say that Trickster Huang, that bastard, built a huge tomb and doomed his entire family.”</p><p></p><p>“Because that Ghost Lamp Temple contains ghosts that are about to reach maturity, a discerning person bought the temple and laid down a seal so as to prevent the ghosts and spirits from harming humans.  But someone actually destroyed the temple to build a tomb on the land. That’s virtually leaping on the earth god’s head to cause trouble (i.e. deliberately angering a far greater power)… By following the energy of the tombstone, the spirits were able to track down the owner of the tomb and his family members, and consume their life energy. For the entire family to die can be considered fortunate; as long as nine generations after him are spared, he’s lucky.” Soft Feather replied. These pieces of information were not considered secrets to ordinary people so she was able to say them.</p><p></p><p>Tubo’s grandpa fell into a long silence. He affixed his gaze on Soft Feather before calling out two words, “Blind superstition!”</p><p></p><p>“Youngster, believe in science, knowledge is power. Don’t learn from those ghostly superstitions!” Tubo’s grandpa was undeniably a modern-minded old man.</p><p></p><p>“Pffft–” Shuhang could not help but laugh out loud.</p><p></p><p>But after he laughed, a chill ran through his heart.</p><p></p><p>Was it really something as simple as just superstition? Could there really be such a coincidence?</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather’s face instantly turned red from embarrassment; sometimes she was really thin-skinned.</p><p></p><p>It was a good thing that Tubo’s grandpa didn’t nitpick too much about this topic. He was a very conversational old man and possessed all kinds of knowledge from all around the world.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang and Soft Feather rested at Tubo’s grandpa’s home until nine o’clock that night, both hosts and the guests thoroughly enjoying themselves.</p><p></p><p>After borrowing a bike from Tubo, Shuhang and Soft Feather returned to the hotel.</p><p></p><p>“Rest early.” Shuhang felt that after everything that had transpired in this day, both his body and mind were exhausted. After bidding Soft Feather goodbye, he entered his room to rest.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather sweetly smiled and waved.</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>“Senior, wake up. Wake up.” In the midst of his dreams, Shuhang felt as though his chest was being rather suffocated, before a small, icy hand patted his face.</p><p></p><p>“Uwh? Let me sleep a bit more… I’m sleepy.” Song Shuhang waved his hand vigorously, swatting away the thing on his face.</p><p></p><p>“Senior, wake up now. It’s almost time.” Those two dainty hands rubbed his face strenuously.</p><p></p><p>The hands were icy cold, and very comfortable as they pressed against his face.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang who had been sleeping soundly had no choice but to blearily open his eyes. Then, he realised that there was an unsurpassed beauty sitting on his chest in a very sexual manner.</p><p></p><p>Big breasts, long slender legs, black long hair that reached her waist, the soft sensation of a tight ass pressed against his chest… it was Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>The proverb goes “What you think about during the day, you will dream about at night.”</p><p></p><p>During the day, he had spent all his time with this beauty, Soft Feather, so it wasn’t strange at all that he would dream about her at night in such shady scenarios. Hence, Song Shuhang smiled stupidly before falling asleep again.</p><p></p><p>“Senior, wake up!” Soft Feather pinched Shuhang’s cheeks with both hands, rubbing them with force.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, this isn’t a dream. In the middle of the night, Soft Feather had crawled into his bed.</p><p></p><p>More importantly… only he possessed his room key. How had Soft Feather entered the room? This was the twenty-third floor!</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the time. It was 11 o’clock and approaching midnight.</p><p></p><p>Girl, feeling your way into my bed in the middle of the night, this could very easily mislead people.</p><p></p><p>“What’s up?” Song Shuhang tried his hardest to calm his demeanor and asked.</p><p></p><p>“Let’s go to the Ghost Lamp Temple,” Soft Feather replied. “Midnight is when it’s easiest to find ghosts.”</p><p></p><p>What? Ghosts?</p><p></p><p>Girl, you’ve traveled thousands of miles to J City just to catch those random ghosts?</p><p></p><p>What kind of crap is this?</p><p></p><p>He had thought that Soft Feather wanted to find the Ghost Lamp Temple because of some important thing… He had never even imagined that someone could use “catching ghosts” as an excuse to rush thousands of miles to reach J City.</p><p></p><p>With this super beauty Soft Feather sitting on top of him, he had long since experienced a reaction. Was this girl unafraid that his predatory instincts would take over him?</p><p></p><p>Uh…maybe Soft Feather was really not afraid. With her firepower, she was able to massacre five drunkards with a single whip of her leg. If Song Shuhang gave in to his predatory nature, that would surely result in a tragedy.</p><p></p><p>Using a single palm, Soft Feather leapt off his body with a flawless mid air tumble. She landed lightly beside his bed without making even the slightest sound.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang sat up helplessly. He changed his clothes in the washroom and wiped his face to freshen up. At any rate, he had already accompanied her to J City. Right now, he might as well sacrifice his life to escort his lord, escort her throughout her insanity.</p><p></p><p>“Shall we ride the bike?” Shuhang asked.</p><p></p><p>“Yes.” Soft Feather nodded as she pulled her huge suitcase along.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang said, “Then, won’t bringing such a large suitcase with you be a problem?”</p><p></p><p>With a wave of her dainty hand, Soft Feather raised the suitcase and put it on top of her head as if it was as light as a feather “It’ll be no problem at all, it doesn’t take up any space.”</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang felt his knees growing rather weak.</p><p></p><p>Luckily he hadn’t given in to his predatory instincts. Otherwise, tomorrow, perhaps the man called “Song Shuhang” would be nothing but a corpse encased in a horse-skin body bag.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>The roars of the bike disturbed the dreams of others in this late night, Song Shuhang resolutely accelerated, speedily leaving the hotel district.</p><p></p><p>Following the direction Tubo’s grandpa pointed towards, the pair quickly found that forest. It wasn’t hard to find at all, but because this was a tomb, it was also the reason why nobody knew that this was where Ghost Lamp Temple was.</p><p></p><p>The bike couldn’t go on further ahead, and further progress had to be made on foot.</p><p></p><p>“Do you need my help?” Shuhang asked.</p><p></p><p>“Please be at ease Senior, a mere spirit ghost can’t harm me. I can deal with them very quickly. Senior, you just need to keep a lookout for a while.” Soft Feather happily laughed.</p><p></p><p>While they spoke, the two had arrived where Huang Dagen and family were buried.</p><p></p><p>The huge chair shaped tomb was a design that was very popular 60 years ago. It was unknown whether Huang Dagen had known his whole family was going to die that year, for the constructed tomb was huge, and just enough to fit in the family’s four generations, there were 14 people that were buried here.</p><p></p><p>As it was late night, the cemetery seemed a little eerie.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang couldn’t help but hug onto his coat, and recited in his heart, “It can’t be that we will really meet ghosts, right?”</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Soft Feather had already begun taking action.</p><p></p><p>The huge suitcase of hers opened, and there was a layer of light radiating from it. Song Shuhang could see layers of jade sheets, there was over a hundred of them!</p><p></p><p>There was also a purplish gold bell, which seemed like copper yet wasn’t copper, and seemed like gold yet wasn’t gold, but it gave off a feeling, a feeling like it was very expensive!</p><p></p><p>“Phew!” Soft Feather lightly released a breath, her head full of black hair swayed without any nearby wind, looking brave and heroic!</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Soft Feather began taking out some silver metal rods, one after another, surrounding the entire whole tomb. These silver rods also seemed extremely expensive. Then, she took out a stack of talisman paper that was bound together with a cord, and wrapped them over a whole circle of the silver metal rods.</p><p></p><p>But she still wasn’t done, she took out various types of powder, and liquor and put it by the side of the tomb. It was unknown what the powder actually was, while the liquor had a dull light to it, appearing to be something good.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang found a clean stone to sit on, and watched Soft Feather working by the side of the tomb.</p><p></p><p>Unwittingly, sleepiness filled him, and he felt his vision turn hazy.</p><p></p><p>An unknown amount of time later.</p><p></p><p>When Song Shuhang once again opened his eyes in a daze, he saw Soft Feather gracefully dancing at the tomb…… Dancing at a tomb late at night, this lady’s hobby is truly special!</p><p></p><p>Huh? Beside the lady, there seemed to be two green lights flickering, like it was accompanying Soft Feather in the dance, it looked very nice. The only pity was that this place wasn’t beautiful, the tomb made this aesthetically beautiful scene seem weird.</p><p></p><p>For such a beautiful scene, it should be recorded and kept!</p><p></p><p>Shuhang slipped his hand into his pocket to take out his phone. It must be said that Song Shuhang was truly daring, if ordinary people saw this scene, their first reaction should be fright and pee. Yet this guy instead wanted to record this scene.</p><p></p><p>As he was still in a dazed state, his stiff fingers carelessly let the phone fall out of his pocket, and onto the floor.</p><p></p><p>The light from his cellphone’s display vaguely illuminated something strange by his feet!  				</p>'),(31,2,'Chapter 21 Poison Dragon Grass how dangerous',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 21: Poison Dragon Grass, how dangerous!</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather, who was in the midst of gracefully dancing, was actually angry in her heart, because a mere ghost dared to move alongside her. Furthermore, this had happened in front of Senior!</p><p></p><p>The matter regarding spirit ghosts in Ghost Lamp Temple was something she had learned about from a note inside one of her father’s old books.</p><p></p><p>Her father had once passed by this place many years ago, and saw a spirit ghost that was about to mature.</p><p></p><p>Spirit ghosts are rare. For a mature spirit ghost, even if it’s of inferior-grade, once it makes a contract with a master, it would become one with its master, and share its power with the master. This also means that, even if it’s just one more inferior spirit ghost, it’s the equivalent to having one portion of energy more than others!</p><p></p><p>However, at the very best. inferior ghosts could only advance to the 3rd Stage – Houtian.</p><p></p><p>If its quality was of mid grade or above, the spirit ghost would have decent attack prowess, moreover, its cultivation speed would not be slower than that of ordinary cultivators. If it was nurtured well, it could even advance to the level of being 6th Stage – Spirit Monarch, and it would also be a great helper for cultivators that is hard to come by.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, all mid-grade spirit ghosts possesses one or two innate skills. These innate skills come in all shapes and forms. If one was lucky, it might be able a skill that could increase its master’s battle prowess by multiple folds.</p><p></p><p>As for high-grade spirit ghosts, they possess intelligence no less than that of a human, and their cultivation speed is even faster than common cultivators. They would even be able to practice some Ghost Dao magic. When they cultivate to the limit, they could transform into Ghost Immortals, and could be considered to be on the same level as the legendary doppelganger technique. Yet high-grade ghosts were existences to wish for but not something that could be looked for. Throughout the last tens of thousands of years, the number of high-grade spirit ghosts that have been recorded number less than five.</p><p></p><p>Other than this, mid-grade and above spirit ghosts can even temper their master’s qi. It doesn’t matter whether it’s blood qi, true qi, or spiritual qi, they can all be utilized between the attributes shared by the master and spirit ghost. Being tempered by the spirit ghost, it will become more pure with an increased quantity.</p><p></p><p>With a contract it will never betray its master for all eternity, it will do whatever it’s asked to and never voice a complaint. Other than being unable to warm the bed and give birth to monkeys for its master, spirit ghosts are practically the best dao companions.</p><p>[TL: Warm the bed means XXX, while giving birth to monkeys probably means bearing the master’s children.]</p><p></p><p>It is a shame that spirit ghosts have always been rarely seen even during ancient times, and their numbers have always been low. Even in present day, spirit ghosts are on the brink of extinction.</p><p></p><p>This was why Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage was so astonished when he found a spirit ghost that grew up in the wild in present day. The difficulty of this was akin to finding a tyrannosaurus rex in a major city.</p><p></p><p>It was a pity that at that time this spirit ghost hadn’t matured, so Spiritual Butterfly’s Respected Sage bought Ghost Lamp Temple, and set up a simple seal to keep the spirit ghost locked, to wait for it to grow up.</p><p></p><p>To him, a spirit ghost of that grade was far too weak, it was completely useless to him even if it had matured. But he was about to have a daughter, and the spirit ghost could be of use to her in the future.</p><p></p><p>However, that future had arrived, while Spiritual Butterfly’s Respected Sage seemed to have forgotten about it though? He didn’t mention anything regarding Ghost Lamp Temple to his daughter at all. Perhaps to an existence like him, a mere spirit ghost was too insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Until Soft Feather ‘accidentally’ found the notes her father had written.</p><p></p><p>As a result, taking advantage of the fact that her father was at Mad Saber Three Waves’ home torturing him, she secretly left for J City alone, intending to capture the spirit ghost.</p><p></p><p>Since her trip began, everything had went without a hitch. However, Soft Feather never expected one thing, Ghost Lamp Temple actually contained two spirit ghosts!</p><p></p><p>While she followed the movements of the first spirit ghost, the second spirit ghost hid itself in the dark to make a sneak attack on her, forcing her into a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>That’s strange, Father definitely stated that he only saw one spirit ghost. Why are there two now? How did this other ghost get here?</p><p></p><p>Furthemore, for mere spirit ghosts to suppress her, how could she not be annoyed?</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>If one wished to capture spirit ghosts, there were two methods. One way is to use the emotional route, whereby you get close to the ghost by spending many days and nights with it. Shocking the heavens and making the god of ghosts sob, once they have felt the person’s sincerity, the spirit ghost will naturally submit. This method requires quite a bit of charisma and patience, especially charisma. If one’s charisma was too low, it’s likely that they would be unable to form a relationship with the ghost, and would instead become the spirit ghost’s meal.</p><p></p><p>The other method is through sheer force. Fight the ghost until they give in. This is a pretty cruel and yet simple tactic. Once you see the ghost, beat it up until it is are half-dead, and then voilà, you have a spirit ghost!</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather chose the latter method.</p><p></p><p>She was, after all, a 3rd Stage – Houtian Battle Emperor, her true qi had condensed into a true river; which flowed ceaselessly, and her fists were unimaginably strong! Add her incredibly kick-ass father to the equation, who supplied her with a body full of godly equipments, she was in a condition where if she meets a god, she will slaughter that god, if she meets a ghost she will behead that ghost!</p><p></p><p>Although the spirit ghosts’ sneak attack had confused her slightly, it was just that and nothing more!</p><p></p><p>“Be sealed!” Soft Feather cutely called out, with a flip of her hands, two shiny gold paper talismans appeared, speeding towards the two spirit ghosts.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she was too lazy to use these charms, but she was so annoyed with them that she wanted to take the two ghosts down as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Once the charm landed on the spirit ghosts, their bodies started to produce green smoke. They began to generate blood curdling screams, and they quickly weakened. Soft Feather then seized this opportunity to get up close and personal. Her figure moved as though she was dancing, her two hands relentlessly struck the spirit ghosts’ bodies and repeatedly hit them until they retreated in defeat.</p><p></p><p>With each hit those small hands put out, the spirit ghosts’ bodies unceasingly emitted breaking sounds. As their bodies split open, it seemed like they would just crumble at any moment.</p><p></p><p>This happened even though Soft Feather was controlling her strength, because she wanted to tame the spirit ghosts, she could only injure them but not take their lives. If she utilized her full strength, one palm strike from her was enough to send the spirit ghost’s soul shattering apart.</p><p></p><p>The two spirit ghosts’ were at their limit, and they decided to use their final trump card.</p><p></p><p>One of the spirit ghosts roared, at its side a golden shield appeared, and it slammed the shield against Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>The other spirit ghost also roared, and a shining red light surrounded its body. Immediately, its body swelled to twice its normal size.</p><p></p><p>Innate Magic! The two spirit ghosts were actually mid-grade or above.</p><p></p><p>“So this is your trump card?” Soft Feather’s gaze was as sharp as a sword, her two hands clasped together with her wrists met. Her palms opened into the shape of a butterfly: “If this is all you have, then be vanquished and submit to me!”</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather used Spiritual Butterfly Island’s secret technique, Dancing Butterfly Palms. At 2nd Stage – True Expert level, it could penetrate all kinds of defensive shields. For mere spirit ghosts that haven’t started cultivating, breaking the innate skill of defensive shields they had executed was just child’s play to her.</p><p></p><p>An explosion burst forth from her palm and the small golden shield formed by the spirit ghost shattered like glass. The spirit ghost hiding behind said shield found itself severely injured, to the point that it could not get up. On the surface of its body, cracks began to emerge.</p><p></p><p>Now, all Soft Feather needed to do was to execute the contract, and it would be bound to her.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the spirit ghost that had been enveloped in red light charged forward, and pulled the other spirit ghost up from the ground. At the same time, with lightning speed it charged away, trying to escape.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather was quite strong, but her battle experience was lacking. To think that two spirit ghosts that had been nearly within reach escaped.</p><p></p><p>After expanding its body once, the spirit ghost’s strength appeared to have increased a considerable amount, as it was actually able to break through the the spirit sealing formation laid out by Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>With the array broken, the two spirit ghosts were able to maliciously dash towards Song Shuhang. They needed to suck a living human’s blood in order to recover from their injuries and return back to have another fight to the death with this frightful woman.</p><p></p><p>As for fleeing? The spirit ghosts had never thought about it. If they were able to leave this place, why hadn’t they left and instead remained here for over sixty years?</p><p></p><p>Mid-grade spirit ghosts are bound to have some form of intelligence.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Song Shuhuang was crouching to get his phone because it had dropped to the ground.</p><p></p><p>“Oh no, Senior Song.” Soft Feather was panicking in her heart, her right foot firmly stomped on the ground. Her body transformed, looking similar to that of a butterfly, like a ray of light she launched herself towards the two spirit ghosts!</p><p></p><p>But that made the spirit ghost who had released its innate skill increase its powers to the limit and attempt to ignore her attacks, it had instead chose to viciously charge towards Shuhuang.</p><p></p><p>If they had to die, they must take someone with them!</p><p></p><p>When the two spirit ghosts were just about to reach Song Shuhang, the said person wasn’t even panicking,  he instead picked up his mobile phone. He then switched on the cellphone’s lights to look at the ground. He seemed to have noticed a weird plant.</p><p></p><p>With the light of his cellphone, he managed to have a better look at the plant. It was curved, almost looking like a coiling dragon. This plant was sharply pointed at one tip, and the stem was purplish-black.</p><p></p><p>He wiped off his sweat. Isn’t this the Poison Dragon Grass that Medicine Master had uploaded at Nine Provinces (1) Group?!</p><p></p><p>Shuhang was thinking this while he moved his hand to clutch the grass, and used all his strength to pull it out. If Soft Feather were to see this, she would definitely find a way to send it to Medicine Master.</p><p></p><p>And when that happens, the Medicine Master would then throw this thing into a pot and concoct it in 5 minutes, and then if someone drank it, it would kill that someone wouldn’t it?</p><p></p><p>Hence, without knowing whether the grass was harmful to one’s life, Song Shuhuang decided that he definitely couldn’t let Soft Feather discover this herb.</p><p></p><p>*Bang!*</p><p></p><p>When the grass was pulled out, Shuhang’s ears picked up a sound like something had smashed into a wall. He raised his head and looked all around him, but couldn’t find anything, there was only Soft Feather, who stood nearby, with a face full of excitement and astonishment.  				</p>'),(32,2,'Chapter 22 An Unexpected Gift',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 22: An Unexpected Gift</p><p></p><p>From Soft Feather’s perspective:</p><p></p><p>Right at the moment that the two ghosts were fiercely charging towards Shuhang, she saw that Senior Song was calm and unflustered, stooping down to pick up his cellphone, then pulling out a stalk of Poison Dragon Grass.</p><p></p><p>Senior was really calm, as if the two malevolent spirit ghosts charging at him were just garbage that weren’t worth paying attention to!</p><p></p><p>Poison Dragon Grass is not even a treasured herb, but… this specific Poison Dragon Grass doesn’t appear to have grown naturally here in the wild, instead it seemed like someone had specifically planted it! It seems to be the eye of a formation array.   </p><p></p><p>Once it was pulled out, an incorporeal protective array spread out.</p><p></p><p>As for the two spirit ghosts that had intended to attack Song Shuhang, they collided with an invisible wall as if they were house flies that flew into an electric flycatcher. After two banging sounds, the ghosts fell down to the floor, unable to move. They had lost all ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>“So… so powerful!” Soft Feather said in shock.</p><p></p><p>She was lamenting how she wasn’t as perceptive as Senior Song was.</p><p></p><p>She had been deploying an array for such a long time and hadn’t even noticed the hidden array. When did Senior Song discover it?</p><p></p><p>That Poison Dragon Grass was the eye of an array. This differed completely from normal array’s eyes, the eye of this formation was the switch, once it gets pulled out, the array is activated!</p><p></p><p>This was probably planted by her father sixty years ago.</p><p></p><p>It seems that, at that time, her father had laid down two layers of barriers at Ghost Lamp Temple. One was a simple sealing array to limit the spirit ghost’s movements. Located in the internal section of the temple, since Ghost Lamp Temple had been torn down, it had lost its effect.</p><p></p><p>The other array he had placed, was a powerful sealing technique which usually remained hidden. However, once the Dragon Grass is pulled out, it would be activated. This was essentially an array to tame the spirit ghosts. All of the spirit ghosts in the temple would be tamed and thus, sealed!</p><p></p><p>Senior Song had discovered this second seal the moment he came, right? He had appeared to randomly choose to sit by the eye of the array, in the event that anything unexpected happened to her.</p><p></p><p>As expected of Senior, I have so much to learn from him!</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather thought to herself, and at the same time she leapt toward the two spirit ghosts and stepped on them with her feet.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, she took out two pearls that were suffused with a frigid air from her large suitcase.</p><p></p><p>‘Ghost Sealing Ice Pearl,’ this was a treasure that seals spirit ghosts. Once a spirit ghost enters it, all one needs is to prepare the array related to contracting, and the contract with the spirit ghost would be complete!</p><p></p><p>To prepare for anything that could go awry during the sealing process, Soft Feather brought a large number of ‘Ghost Sealing Ice Pearls’.</p><p></p><p>She then held the spirit pearls between her fingertips, and her two hands quickly casted a number of seals on it.</p><p></p><p>“Seal!” A clear voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>The two heavily injured spirit ghosts no longer had any energy to fight back, and were sealed into the Ghost Sealing Ice Pearls!</p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>Under Song Shuhang’s wide open eyes, the two green lights that had previously been by Soft Feather’s side accompanying her as she danced, were absorbed into the two ice pearls.</p><p></p><p>This scene was incredibly Xuanhuan!</p><p></p><p>There’s no scientific way to explain what had just happened.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang softly swallowed his saliva. The worldview that he took 18 years to construct has mostly crumbled. Perhaps there were truly ghosts in this world?</p><p></p><p>Something like this that cannot be even explained by science, perhaps this is a special event on earth that only exists in legends?</p><p></p><p>“Senior, I have to thank you so much. If it weren’t for your assistance, these two spirit ghosts would have escaped. If they had escaped, they wouldn’t return here ever again and it would have been troublesome to find them again.” Soft Feather was incomparably grateful.</p><p></p><p>“Haha.” Song Shuhang made a dry laugh. Other than making a dry laugh, what else could he say?</p><p></p><p>“Senior, it just so happens that I have two spirit ghosts. I only need one, so the other is a gift to you! Although you might not have much use for it considering your cultivation level, but perhaps you could give it to your children or disciple in the future.” Soft Feather was a very generous person. Mid grade spirit ghosts were priceless, but she didn’t hesitate for a moment before she held it out to Shuhang.</p><p></p><p>I don’t even have a girlfriend, where are my children going to come from?</p><p></p><p>“This is too precious, I cannot accept this!” Song Shuhang replied in a serious tone. Are you trying to kill me, this ice pearl has a ghost inside! Although he was in a state of half believe and half doubt, but what if there were really ghosts inside?</p><p></p><p>What if a ghost came out? What was he going to do? He was just an ordinary person, and had no way of fighting against ghosts. He’s definitely going to get his blood drained away and die to the ghost!</p><p></p><p>Something like this, he can’t possibly accept, right?</p><p></p><p>“Senior, please, you must accept this. This is to thank you for accompanying me to this trip to the Ghost Lamp Temple, for you’ve helped me too much! If you don’t accept this spirit ghost, my heart will be uneasy, and it will affect my cultivation in the future!” Soft Feather insisted, and then proceeded to forcefully stuff one of the ‘Ghost Sealing Ice Pearls’ into his hands, not allowing any rejection.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang could only feel a chill entering his hand under this hot weather. He actually felt that his whole body was more cool and refreshed. If this thing was on him during summer, it would definitely feel as if he was carrying an air conditioner with him.</p><p></p><p>“Alright, let’s go back.” Soft Feather smiled, quickly packed all of her belongings into the suitcase, and cheerfully returned to Shuhang’s side.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang had no choice but to place the ‘Ghost Sealing Ice Pearl’ into his pocket. Since this gift was a token of appreciation from Soft Feather, then he should just keep it. Besides, the spirit ghost has been sealed into this thing, it shouldn’t be able to get out anytime soon, right?</p><p></p><p>This is what he thought.</p><p></p><p>“Let’s go back and sleep. When morning comes we will go to the train station for the train tickets and prepare to go back.” Song Shuhang said.</p><p></p><p>“Yep.” Having achieved her objective without a hitch, Soft Feather was in a very good mood.</p><p></p><p>The two walked shoulder to shoulder out of the forest.</p><p></p><p>“Ouch.” Soft Feather suddenly called, and looked down at her right foot. It was unknown to her at what time had the glue to the sole lost effectiveness, and the sole fell.</p><p></p><p>It was actually damaged when she was chasing after those two spirit ghosts.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang turned  his head in bewilderment: “Hm?”</p><p></p><p>“My shoe is spoilt.” Soft Feather lifted her right leg. The sole had broken off, exposing her delicate jade foot. Her crystal clean foot cutely tilted about.</p><p></p><p>“I’ll support you, the motorcycle is just ahead. In addition, I remember that there was a shopping street near the hotel. Later on we’ll check whether there are any shoes for sale there.” Song Shuhang laughed.</p><p></p><p>In a short period of time, the motorcycle once again roared, carrying the two of them far away from the Ghost Lamp Temple cemetery.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather took along her large suitcase, and sat in the pillion seat leaning against Shuhang’s back. Her smile crawled upwards, showing her good mood.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang felt that the auntie who sold sandals on the shopping street was really cold-hearted.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang: “Auntie, how much does it cost for this pair of shoes?”</p><p></p><p>The auntie scowled and coldly said. “Forty dollars.”</p><p></p><p>“That’s really expensive, can we buy for it twenty?” Song Shuhang mercilessly bargained. On a shopping street like this, it’s never the wrong choice to directly cut down the price to fifty percent on any product.</p><p></p><p>“Okay.” The auntie laughed coldly. “Do you want the left shoe or the right one?”</p><p></p><p>Shuhang: “….”</p><p></p><p>“Hahahaha.” Soft Feather could not help but laugh so hard that she couldn’t stand straight.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Song Shuhang could only obediently spend forty dollars on a pair of ladies’ sandals and let Soft Feather put them on.</p><p></p><p>The two of them got on the bike and headed towards the hotel.</p><p></p><p>On the way, Song Shuhang asked curiously. “Tell me, what did I do to offend that auntie?” Why do I feel that she was constantly sneering at me? Sneering till the point my back felt so cold.”</p><p></p><p>“I don’t know anything about that!” Soft Feather laughed.</p><p></p><p>Senior, your experience in the mortal world is still far from enough! She thought in her heart.</p><p></p><p>At the shopping street, the auntie coldly remarked. : “This lady is only twenty nine years and 144 months old, and you dare to address me as auntie? You were lucky that I didn’t sell those sandals to you for a price of two hundred and fifty. Hmph!”</p><p>[ED: Bahahaha, She’s had her twenty-ninth birthday twelve times!]</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>At the Ghost Lamp Temple cemetery.</p><p></p><p>After Song Shuhang and Soft Feather had left, another figure emerged from the forest. This person sighed, and took out a cigarette. Lighting it up while trembling, he wore a bitter smile. This was a bitter smile that would make others feel that even if he was a hundred miles away, the agony could still be felt.</p><p></p><p>This figure was that of the mysterious Altar Master. He had hidden himself and waited for an opportunity to act. But until the end, the opportunity that he waited for never came, and he couldn’t make a move at all.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, he had hidden himself to observe from afar, watching Soft Feather and Song Shuhang catch the spirit ghosts.</p><p></p><p>He had thought about seizing the spirit ghosts by force, but didn’t dare to make a move.  				</p>'),(33,2,'Chapter 23 Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sages Scheme',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 23: Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage’s Scheme</p><p></p><p>The opponent’s strength was way beyond the Altar Master’s expectations; they were on completely different levels.</p><p></p><p>One casual palm strike from the lady contained enough force to scare people. The spirit ghost’s innate skill of a golden shield was literally as fragile as paper under the strength of such a strike.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the woman even pulled out a golden paper talisman to deal with those two spirit ghosts. For a high quality good like that, he would have to sell away half of his life for it.</p><p></p><p>“She should at least be at the peak of the 2nd Stage – True Expert level, or maybe she could be at the 3rd stage – Houtian Battle Emperor level. Furthermore, there’s still that youth.” Even though the Altar Master had lived for so long, he still felt as powerless as a dog.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of ability or equipments, he is definitely not the lady’s match. If he had sneak attacked, his fate would not be any better than those two spirit ghosts.</p><p></p><p>No, if he had dared to act, his fate would’ve definitely been much worse than the two spirit ghosts. The spirit ghosts might still have some usefulness to them, but he definitely possessed no value to Soft Feather. As an enemy of no value, it was appropriate to send him to the grave.</p><p></p><p>There’s also that ordinary-looking boy. The man was unable to sense a trace of blood qi or true qi from him. Yet it was that ordinary guy who somehow managed to find the eye of that terrifying sealing array when he randomly found a place to sit. He had activated the array at the a crucial time, thereby capturing the two spirit ghosts and sealing them.</p><p></p><p>This kind of confidence and perception, and adding that to his ‘senior’ identity. When the Altar Master thought of it, he felt his legs quiver.</p><p></p><p>He was naturally a cautious person, or rather one would call him a cowardly man.</p><p></p><p>Because of his cautiousness, he was able to practice the Demonic Ghost technique, and create demon spirits and evil spirits all over the place, as well as healthily survive a hundred and seventy good years.</p><p></p><p>Still, he was bitter.</p><p></p><p>60 years. He wasted 60 years with the Ghost Lamp Temple and its spirit ghosts! 60 years of scheming and waiting, and it was all in vain.</p><p></p><p>No matter how cowardly he might be, he couldn’t accept this.</p><p></p><p>The Altar Master felt his chest turn stuffy. He raised his head to look at the starry sky, his voice mournful. “You’ve already taken away your own spirit ghost, you could have at least left mine for me.”</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Lamp Temple had two spirit ghosts. One was sealed by the Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage. While the other belonged to the Altar Master!</p><p></p><p>Why was he unable to take the two spirit ghosts that had long matured? For what reason did he have to wait for the likes of Soft Feather to steal them?</p><p></p><p>It wasn’t that he did not want to take away the spirit ghost. During the time it took for the spirit ghost to mature, he practically thought about taking the spirit ghost away from Huang Dagen’s tomb for every single moment!</p><p></p><p>But he was unable to do this!</p><p></p><p>With regards to the Ghost Lamp Temple, there were seven insane hidden arrays surrounding Huang Dagen’s tomb that gave people goosebumps. Without including the trapping array and the array that Song Shuhang had triggered with the Poison Dragon Grass as the eye, there were five other terrifying arrays hidden outside the tomb. These were arrays that he couldn’t break through even if you gave him a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>If these arrays were to be activated, you had to wait until Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage’s bloodline descendants arrived, only then could you get rid of it! As long as these seal arrays were not broken, then no one would be able to steal the spirit ghost inside!</p><p></p><p>The sealed spirit ghost could enter the array but not exit!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Altar Master hated this part – he could only seal the spirits inside but not remove them.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he did not notice the hidden array. So he thought that by taking over Huang Dagen and demolishing the Ghost Lamp Temple, he would be able to destroy the sealing array. Afterwards, he would happily treat the Ghost Lamp Temple as his personal belonging and wait for the spirit ghosts to mature.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this Luo Xin Street was truly his land of opportunities. After living in hiding for a few years, he was able to chance upon a not yet matured spirit ghost and gleefully sent it to be nourished in Huang Dagen’s tomb.</p><p></p><p>But just as the spirit ghost matured, when he was about to extract it, he discovered the six other big arrays.</p><p></p><p>This definitely made him feel cheated.</p><p></p><p>Actually, if he had used his brain slightly, he should have realised — no matter what, this was the place where the Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage was preparing spirit ghosts in advance for his daughter. How could the Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage possibly be that careless? In retrospect, even if the Respected Sage didn’t think much of spirit ghosts, he had still bought this piece of land for the sake of getting the spirit ghosts, so there was no way that he was just going to just lay one feeble array to keep the spirit ghosts inside.</p><p></p><p>It was a pity, that for such a simple thing, the Altar Master who was blinded by greed had wasted sixty years without noticing this.</p><p></p><p>“No, it can’t end like this. At least… At the very least, I must get that spirit ghost back. That could be considered as my reward for all these years.” The Altar Master thought.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could obtain one spirit ghost, he would have the opportunity to break through the 2nd Stage – True Expert stage to enter the 3rd Stage – Houtian Battle Emperor stage, which would increase his longevity by another hundred years!</p><p></p><p>Even kneeling and prostrating himself would be fine, no matter what price he had to pay, it would be worth it.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the tomb of Huang Dagen that was enshrouded in the array, the Altar Master felt mysteriously sorrowful and walked away from Huang Dagen’s tomb with heavy footsteps.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>After the Altar Master left, a tall and handsome young man appeared from the bushes. His wore  a lazy expression on this face, and took out his mobile phone to make a call.</p><p></p><p>“Master, junior has found the Ghost Lamp Temple and sealed the spirit ghost. She has already returned to rest. I reckon that she will return to Spiritual Butterfly Island in a day or two.” The man earnestly reported, but there was a tone of laziness ingrained into it.</p><p></p><p>“That’s good. That little brat made me worry so much, there weren’t any accidents in the process, right?” From the phone, the voice of Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage who was on the other side of the line was transmitted.</p><p></p><p>“Yes, there were no accidents.” The disciple reported.</p><p></p><p>“Very good. Continue to watch over your junior sister and report to me once you return to the island.” The Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage said and then added; “Also, clean up the arrays I laid, so as to avoid the accidental activation of the arrays from causing civilian casualties. Sorry for the trouble, Jianyi.”</p><p></p><p>“Leave it to me, I will make sure to do a good job so you need not worry!” The man laughed, hung up and shrugged.</p><p></p><p>Actually, there had been some bumps that happened along the way. For example, that Altar Master, and there was also that young man named Song Shuhang.</p><p></p><p>Looking in the direction where the Altar Master had left, Liu Jianyi yawned. “Well, how should I say it, this guy can be quite tactful. Since he did not make a move, that saved me the trouble of making a move myself.”</p><p></p><p>The Altar Master was lucky that he did not have an opportunity to make a move. If he had dared to take up a pose of attacking Soft Feather, he would have been sent into the tomb with Huang Dagen and be his companion in hell.</p><p></p><p>As for that Song Shuhang, he was extremely troublesome! If Master found out that this girl, Soft Feather had barged into a man’s room in the middle of the night, and sat in that kind of position on his chest to converse with him, wouldn’t that send his master flying into a rage?</p><p></p><p>When that moment comes, would his master assign him the task of spying on Song Shuhang? So in regards to the matter regarding Song Shuhang, he definitely wasn’t going to inform his master.</p><p></p><p>It’s too troublesome. Liu Jianyi lazily thought. In any case, Soft Feather wasn’t harmed in any way, and didn’t lose anything of value. Instead, she received a lot of help from that man, Song Shuhang.</p><p></p><p>What is important is that he was a man who held conserving energy very highly. There was one time where he was too lazy to breathe, so he painstakingly learnt the Turtle Breathing Technique. In the end, he reached the stage of only requiring three breaths a month. His life’s motto was, if he can use one finger to settle something, he absolutely won’t use two fingers.</p><p></p><p>Something like creating more trouble for himself was something he would absolutely not do!</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather would never have expected that her discovering her father’s notes, and the whole journey to Ghost Lamp Temple was something that her father had secretly planned out for her. For this journey, Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage even sent his disciple to take care of his daughter, it could be said that he had put a lot of thought into this.</p><p></p><p>In actuality, even if Mad Saber Three Waves didn’t invite his own destruction, Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage would have found some other reason to temporarily leave Spiritual Butterfly Island.</p><p></p><p>Mad Saber Three Waves could only blame himself for leaping into the line of fire, which saved Spiritual Butterfly Respected Sage the time for finding an excuse.</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>June 3rd, 1st week of the month, clear weather.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang only managed to get up after struggling till it was 8AM.</p><p></p><p>This time, there wasn’t Soft Feather straddling his chest to make him get up.</p><p></p><p>But this made him feel more calm and easy, yet he faintly felt a little depressed. Human nature is dirty!</p><p></p><p>Once he got up, he picked up the phone on his bedside to give Soft Feather a call, “Have you gotten up?”</p><p></p><p>“I’m already awake, I just ended my morning meditation, are we going back now, Senior?” Soft Feather asked.</p><p></p><p>“Let’s go have our breakfast, then we’ll return.” Song Shuhang answered, the hotel did provide a complimentary breakfast buffet.  				</p>'),(34,2,'Chapter 24 Student Song Shuhang heres your express delivery',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 24: Student Song Shuhang, here’s your express delivery</p><p></p><p>9AM in the morning.</p><p></p><p>The pair sat on the train heading towards Jiangnan University. They had good luck, as they arrived at J City’s Black Elephant station at 8:45 while the train was due to leave at 9AM.</p><p></p><p>The journey back was peaceful.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived at Jiangnan University City, it was already noon.</p><p></p><p>“Would you like to go to my place to play?” Song Shuhang said politely. He realised upon asking her that having only known her for a few days that he wasn’t close enough to her to suggest that. Their relationship was similar to that of acquaintances, asking this of her was extremely rude of him.</p><p></p><p>“Thank you very much Senior, if I ever have time in the future I will definitely come find you. However, I must now rush home to complete the contract with this spirit ghost first. Furthermore, if I delay any further daddy might return, and that would be very bad.” Soft Feather kindly declined with a sweet smile and a slight bow.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang laughed heartily. “Then this is where we part. You can take a taxi directly to Jiangnan Airport once you exit the train station. Will you be alright by yourself?”</p><p></p><p>“There’ll be no problem, I have already booked the ticket for my return flight as well. I just need to get to the airport and then I will be able to get home. By the way Senior, what is your address? I still need to send you those two boxes of herbs!” Soft Feather suddenly remembered the promise she had made before their trip.</p><p></p><p>She is a proper lady that keeps her word, if she promises to do something she would definitely do everything she could to fulfill it.</p><p></p><p>“Forget about it, let’s talk about that another time.” Grasping this so called ice pearl with a ‘ghost sealed’ within, Song Shuhang faintly felt that the medicinal ingredients that Soft Feather had mentioned earlier weren’t nearly as simple as he previously thought.</p><p></p><p>“Senior, please don’t think that I am one who goes back on their word. The word of a Butterfly Islander holds the weight of nine cauldrons!” Soft Feather seriously insisted.</p><p></p><p>“Okay then…” Song Shuang knew that he couldn’t refuse, so took out his notebook and wrote down his mailing address on it, then tore out the page and gave it to Soft Feather.</p><p></p><p>Soft Feather carefully stored this note, and then bade Shuhang farewell.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang watched her leave, then heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>“It’s finally over! I probably won’t have any interaction with this lady again, right?” Song Shuhang scratched his head and laughed to himself. “Time to go back!”</p><p></p><p>To the future Song Shuhang, you have to be grateful to Soft Feather’s insistence on this day!</p><p></p><p>If she hadn’t insisted on sending those two boxes of herbs, Song Shuhang would have stayed an ordinary person for his entire life. He would finish university, find an ordinary job, marry an ordinary wife and have cute kids. A simplistic, idyllic life would have been his future.</p><p></p><p>As a result of Soft Feather’s support today, Song Shuhang’s life would soon experience a transformation that would shake the heavens and rock the earth.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>Nine Provinces (1) Group.</p><p></p><p>North River’s Loose Practitioner: “Soft Feather, did you manage to find the Ghost Lamp Temple?”</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Butterfly Island’s Soft Feather (Online via Mobile): “I found it and managed to accomplish my task smoothly, and I’m now on my way home.”</p><p></p><p>“I had mistakenly went to the wrong place, and ended up in Jiangnan City’s Luo Xin Street. However, I was fortunate to meet a powerful senior from the group there, Senior Song, who helped me find the J City’s Luo Xin Street and the Ghost Lamp Temple. Then he helped me accomplish my mission as well!”</p><p></p><p>“The group’s Senior Song? What is that senior’s dao name?” The North River’s Loose Practitioner asked. The surname Song was a very common surname, there were many seniors with the surname Song in the group.</p><p></p><p>“Ah!” Soft Feather sent a tongue stuck-out expression. “I asked him for his dao name, but he didn’t tell me. I then forgot about it afterwards, but I do know that his name is Song Shuhang!”</p><p></p><p>“Song Shuhang, this name sounds familiar…” The North River’s Loose Practitioner felt that he heard the name somewhere before but couldn’t remember where. “Haha, in any case, I should congratulate you on your smooth completion of the task.”</p><p></p><p>After all, he had agreed to help but in the end yet wasn’t much help at all. He felt guilty in this regard.</p><p></p><p>“Thank you North River Senior, you were very helpful too!” Soft Feather happily commented. “I am boarding the plane now, I’ll talk to you later!”</p><p></p><p>On the plane, Soft Feather switched off her phone and looked out the window.</p><p></p><p>The seniors in the chat group are truly very nice.</p><p></p><p>Especially Senior Song, he’s such an incredibly nice guy!</p><p></p><p>The shining good friend card was firmly placed onto Song Shuhang’s head despite the great distance between them.</p><p></p><p>＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>June 4th, Tueday, relentless heat!</p><p></p><p>Jiangnan University City, the lecture theatre had fourteen large fans blowing frantically, yet all it blew was hot wind, making people turn even more muddle-headed.</p><p></p><p>The lecturer’s back had long been soaked with sweat, it was hot to the point that speech became a lot softer.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang sat upright in the classroom on this hot summer’s day. Unlike the others in the room, he felt pretty clear-headed.</p><p></p><p>He had attended so many classes ever since he was young, yet this was the first time he had attended in such a relaxed manner. He was able to memorize the contents of the lesson that the lecturer was teaching, and was even able to clarify three points just from hearing one point, speedily grasping the important things.</p><p></p><p>He even had the ability to multitask in this situation. While paying attention in class, he was also allowing his thoughts to run wild on other matters.</p><p></p><p>By his side, there was a female student that was sitting three seats away from him. She could not help but get closer and closer to him. In the end, she wished that she could stick her well-developed body onto Song Shuhang, and let the smell of her perfume unceasingly enter his nose.</p><p></p><p>This was not because Song Shuhang’s charm had increased overnight. Rather, in this blistering hot weather, he was producing cold air, almost like a human air conditioner. It made it hard for people to not move closer to him.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang secretly lowered his head to look at the pearl hanging from his neck. This was the ‘Ghost Sealing Ice Pearl’ that Soft Feather gave her. When he put on this pearl, it automatically removed all of the torrid heat on Song Shuhang’s body, and even gave him a cool layer of protection against the sweltering heat.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when he wore this pearl, he felt that his mind became very clear and agile. In the past, he had to recite the English idioms three to four times before he could memorise them. Now, he felt like he was able to keep them firmly in his heart just by hearing them once.</p><p></p><p>This… was definitely a godlike item for studying! With this, he could get through school with no difficulties.</p><p></p><p>This item was already somewhat beyond the realm of what science could explain.</p><p></p><p>The scene of what happened when Soft Feather ‘sealed the ghosts’ surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>“Do they really exist?” Song Shuhang murmured to himself. This miraculous ice pearl made him believe in the existence of cultivation a little bit more.</p><p></p><p>In this pearl, is there really a spirit ghost sealed inside?</p><p></p><p>Cultivation, is it truly more than a legend?</p><p></p><p>Immortals that could fly? Do they actually exist?</p><p></p><p>Is it really possible to move the mountains and seas?</p><p></p><p>One after another, questions surfaced in Shuhang’s mind, filling his brain.</p><p></p><p>If these things truly exist……  Then are the people in the Nine Province (1) Group really immortals?</p><p></p><p>He never had a day that he wanted to look at ‘Nine Provinces (1) Group’ more than today, he wanted to see the conversations between the people inside, and find evidence to support his hypothesis.</p><p></p><p>Why hasn’t the class ended yet? Please end quickly.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang muttered in his heart.</p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>*Ding Ding Dong*</p><p></p><p>The bell for break time had sounded.</p><p></p><p>The students in the classroom all cheered excitedly then quickly stood up to leave the steamer-like classroom, and walked out to the hallway to cool down.</p><p></p><p>There was only the girl who sat beside Song Shuhang who felt reluctant to leave. She felt that it was very cooling by his side, and it was even more comfortable than an air conditioner. It was a shame she wasn’t Song Shuhang’s girlfriend, it wasn’t appropriate to continue bothering Shuhang when class had ended.</p><p></p><p>Should she try to be Song Shuhang’s girlfriend? She quietly eyed Shuhang. Although he didn’t stand out in class, wasn’t he very manly? It’s so tempting, if she could hug a cool man like him to sleep in the hot summer, he would make the best body pillow, right?</p><p></p><p>“Hello, may I ask if student Shuhang is around?” At this point, there was a powerful voice by the door.</p><p></p><p>This ear-splitting sound made all the students at the scene come to a stop.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang looked over, and noticed the man dressed in a suit. He had a scary face which displayed an awkwardly kind smile.</p><p></p><p>I don’t seem to know him?</p><p></p><p>He got up and raised his hand. “That would be me. May I ask who are you and what do you want from me?”</p><p></p><p>“Haha, I am from Feng Shou Courier. There are two large packages for student Song Shuhang that had been sent by means of express delivery via air travel, sent to you at maximum speeds overnight. Because this was sent at the request of an extremely important customer, so I require your personal signature before handing it over.” The formal man laughed, and respectfully handed his name card over to Song Shuhang.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang received the business card and looked at it.</p><p></p><p>Feng Shou Courier Corporation LLC, Sima Jiang!</p><p></p><p>This was a simple name card, with no information on his post, just the his name and the name of the company.</p><p></p><p>Even courier personnel hands out name cards these days?</p><p></p><p>Shuhang kept this name card with doubts in his head. What express delivery did he have which required immediate air delivery?</p><p></p><p>It was at this point that Soft Feather’s bashful smile surfaced in his mind.  				</p>'),(35,2,'Chapter 25 The two boxes of herbs',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 25: The two boxes of herbs</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Soft Feather for the first time, a person’s first impression would definitely be about her long legs. But after some interaction with her, the first thing that would come to mind would instead be her blushing smile, so moe.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tubo and two other boys stood up and walked over to Shuhang’s side and asked him, “Shuhang, did something happen?”</p><p></p><p>They were Shuhang’s three roommates. When they saw that this tall dark man was looking for Shuhang, they were worried as well as curious as to what was going on.</p><p></p><p>“Nothing much, it’s just an express delivery and they have two packages for me. I need to sign before I can accept it.” Shuhang said with a smile, then he turned back to ask Sima Jiang, “Little Jiang, it’s nice to meet you. Where are the boxes?”</p><p></p><p>Little Jiang…… The man in the suit’s mouth twitched. How many years has it been since someone dared to address him as such? He never thought that he would have the chance to hear this from someone, moreover it came from a young man.</p><p></p><p>However, this gave him a refreshing feeling as he laughed. “It is already at the entrance of your dormitory, we just need for you to verify it.”</p><p></p><p>“Shall we go now then? It just so happens that I have a fifteen minute break.” Shuhang replied.</p><p></p><p>Sima Jiang laughed, “I have been waiting for you to say that!”</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>Shuhang stood at the doorstep of his room on the second floor of the men’s dormitory.</p><p></p><p>Four men dressed in black suits were guarding a pair of 80cmx80cm boxes with serious expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang was speechless. “Is your Feng Shou Courier service always this amazing?”</p><p></p><p>Your service is so amazing, is there even a way out for other couriers?</p><p></p><p>“Haha, our service has always been amazing. However, the sender this time is rather special,  which is why our service this time is of an even higher quality.” Sima Jiang chortled.</p><p></p><p>“Thank you for your hard work.” Song Shuhang nodded, and looked at the courier receipt as he stood in front of the two boxes.</p><p></p><p>As expected, on the sender column, the name ‘Soft Feather’ was written. However, the sender’s address and other columns weren’t filled in.</p><p></p><p>These two packing cases were probably the boxes of herbs for concocting the ‘Simplified Body Tempering Liquid’ that Soft Feather had promised him.</p><p></p><p>“Do you need to confirm the contents?” Sima Jiang asked politely.</p><p></p><p>Fact was there was simply no need to look. Even if Sima Jiang had the heart of a dragon or guts of a tiger, he still wouldn’t dare to open it without approval.</p><p></p><p>“There’s no need for that. If there are any problems, I will directly contact you.” Song Shuhang waved him off, brandishing the name card in his hand.</p><p></p><p>“That is natural, if there are no problems, may I please have Student Shuhang sign here.” Sima Jiang’s impression of Song Shuhang soared, and he pointed to the spot on the courier receipt that needed to be signed.</p><p></p><p>“Alright.” Song Shuhang reached out and speedily signed his great name onto the line.</p><p></p><p>“We shall now say our farewells to Student Shuhang, we hope you have a good day.” Sima Jiang waved his hand and left with the four men in tow.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang felt that these five men did not look like couriers. They were all so inhumanely muscular and intimidating.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang opened his room’s door. “Damn, I forgot to ask them to help move the two boxes inside. I hope they aren’t heavy.”</p><p></p><p>He had a deep impression of Soft Feather’s heavy luggage, and was worried that these two boxes’ weight would be in tons.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, when he tried to lift the two boxes, he found that they weren’t as heavy as expected.</p><p></p><p>He carried them one by one into the room and then lifted them onto his bed.</p><p></p><p>After closing the door, Song Shuhang impatiently opened the cardboard boxes. Inside the cardboard box, there were numerous small intricate wooden cases. Each cardboard box was comprised of 4 layers, and each layer contained 4 wooden cases. Altogether, there were 32 wooden cases in both boxes.</p><p></p><p>Carefully inspecting the contents of the small wooden cases, he found over forty medicinal ingredients in them.</p><p></p><p>He noticed there were ginseng, Goji Berry, Actinolite, Ladies’ Fragrance and more.</p><p></p><p>There were some that Shuhang had never seen before, but upon smelling them he felt his body and mind relax. It was as though he had been cleansed through the fragrance of these herbs. Among them there were probably the Fresh Overlord Branch, the Nine-Yang Scarlet Flame Bamboo slices and other Xuanhuan ingredients.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang stared blankly at these two boxes of medicinal ingredients.</p><p></p><p>Without even mentioning the other ingredients within the boxes, just the pieces of ginseng inside were worth quite a considerable sum. As for the Morning Dew Grass, Overlord Branch and the Nine-Yang Scarlet Flame Bamboo slices, these were very possibly one hundred times more expensive than the ginseng.</p><p></p><p>But their value wasn’t the reason why Song Shuhang was blankly staring at them.</p><p></p><p>There was only one thing on his mind. Aren’t these the medicinal ingredients for the ‘Simplified Body Tempering Liquid’ prescription?</p><p></p><p>Using these medicinal ingredients, if he followed the recipe that the Medicine Master in the Nine Provinces (1) Group had instructed, by simmering it in the cauldron while paying attention to the intensity of the heat, would he also be able to concoct the Simplified Body Tempering Fluid?</p><p></p><p>Just what kind of effects does the Body Tempering Liquid have? Could it really be like those narrated in Xianxia novels, allowing one to experience rebirth?</p><p></p><p>“Perhaps by utilizing these herbs and following Medicine Master’s instructions, I can ascertain the existence of cultivation!”</p><p></p><p>A thought emerged in Song Shuhang’s mind, once this thought came up, it was like a insatiable fire which couldn’t be extinguished, causing him to be incredibly tempted.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang didn’t consider himself pigheaded, if the Body Tempering Liquid truly possessed an effect like those mentioned in legends, then he would believe that cultivation truly exists.</p><p></p><p>But if it really does exist, what was he going to do?</p><p></p><p>“Since there’re no afternoon classes today, with a total of 45 different herbs, if each herb takes an approximate of 5 minutes, that would be about 3 to 4 hours. Within one afternoon, I can attempt it!”</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang is the kind of person who does something if he wants to do it. Since he had made the decision to do it, then he had to make it happen!</p><p></p><p>“If I want to refine this pill, then I would first need… a pill furnace?”</p><p></p><p>Something like a pill furnace definitely couldn’t be found in the market. Perhaps it could be found on Taobao, but those that can be purchased were definitely only toys.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if he wanted to concoct the Body Tempering Liquid this afternoon, trying to find a pill furnace would be unrealistic, so he had to find something to substitute it.</p><p></p><p>Song Shuhang then walked into the attached kitchen and searched the cabinets.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he managed to find something that could simmer herbs……. A hot pot.</p><p></p><p>But that thought only lasted for a moment before he rejected it. “This won’t do, this deviates too far from an actual pill furnace.”</p><p></p><p>He had never seen a pill furnace before, and so he didn’t know whether it would be like those shown in movies. But no matter what, it should be some kind of stove, a hot pot would be too different.</p><p></p><p>Upon putting the hot pot down, Shuhang searched the kitchen once more.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he still did not manage to find anything.</p><p></p><p>Rice cooker, electric kettle, frying pan, pressure cooker… none of them could substitute a pill furnace.</p><p></p><p>Although the pressure cooker appeared to be more logical, it was meant for cooking through use of high pressure, and couldn’t be opened halfway/in-between. Yet, to concoct the Body Tempering Liquid, an ingredient has to be inserted every five minutes.</p><p></p><p>In other words, after all that looking, he could only choose that one thing that seemed relatively suitable for the job. Song Shuhang helplessly stared at the hot pot.</p><p></p><p>“Well, since they’re both used to simmer, why don’t I just give it a shot?” He pinched his chin. Since there’s thirty two sets of herbs, it would be acceptable even if he failed once!</p><p></p><p>He just felt that it would be a little wasteful, after all these herbs seemed to be very valuable.</p><p></p><p>“Let’s try it once at least. If I don’t try I will never be successful. Besides, even if it fails, I can just think of it as an experience.” Song Shuhang made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>It shall begin this afternoon!</p><p></p><p>Hopefully his roommates wouldn’t mind his eccentricity in the kitchen; or maybe he should find somewhere else to quietly make this attempt?</p><p></p><p>However, right now he had to return for his final class this morning before doing starting.</p><p></p><p>Shuhang opened his cupboard, and placed the wooden cases containing the herbs into the cupboard, one by one.</p><p></p><p>The cupboard provided by the school worked perfectly. Once he took his personal belongings that were in the cupboard out, all of the medicinal herbs were able to fit perfectly.</p><p>“This is great. If it hadn’t fit, I wouldn’t know where else I could hide them.” Song Shuhang muttered.  				</p>'),(36,3,'Chapter 1 - Cultivation Online',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>\"Brother!

The difference is obvious — you are naturally inferior to those who have a better physique than you! The more talented you are, the easier it will be for you as a Cultivator!\"</p><p>His words caused many faces to sink, especially those with a Mortal Physique.</p><p>\"Can our Physiques be changed?\" Someone suddenly asked.</p><p>\"Physiques can be changed, but the process is a long and painful one, so most people just accept their fate.\"</p><p>The people sighed in relief after hearing that their Mortal Physique can be changed.</p><p>\"Does anyone here happen to have a Divine rank Physique?\" Elder Song\'s eyes flickered with expectation, but when nobody replied to his question the light in his eyes dimmed.</p><p>\'The chances of someone having a Divine Physique is one in a hundred million, a genius above genius that knows no equal, so it isn\'t surprising that such a prodigy wouldn\'t appear amongst a mere thousand people.\' He shook his head inwardly.</p><p>\"Elder, I have a Heaven-ranked Physique.\" An individual suddenly said out loud, causing everybody there to look at him.</p><p>\"Hoh? The chances of a Heaven Physique appearing is one in a million. You are a very fortunate one, young genius.

You mean like guilds?\"</p><p>\"A Sect is a place created by one or a group of people for the purpose of nurturing its disciples to become powerful Cultivators — a school for Cultivators, basically.\" Elder Song briefly explained. \"Is that it?

He didn\'t want to think about it.</p><p>\"Umm… excuse me, the brother over there…\" A sweet voice suddenly resounded behind Yuan, making him turn his head.</p><p>\"Huh?\"</p><p>Standing right behind him was a cute little girl in red robes who looked to be around 10 years old, hugging a red ball in one arm and a book in the other.</p><p>\'How did she get so close behind me without making a single sound? I didn\'t even notice her presence! And what is such a young girl doing here, in the middle of nowhere? Perhaps there is a city nearby?\' Yuan became curious.</p><p>\"Are you an NPC or a Player?\" He asked her, who tilted her head sideways with a puzzled expression.</p><p>\"NPC? Player? Xiao Hua is Xiao Hua,\" replied the little girl.</p><p>\"So your name is Xiao Hua, huh.

He couldn\'t imagine it. While it sounded unbelievable, it also explained why such a small girl like her would appear here.</p><p>\"Sorry for intruding, but I was teleported here by some old man against my will…\" He tried to explain without sounding too crazy. \"I\'ll leave immediately, so can you tell me the way?\"</p><p>But out of his expectations, the little girl shook her head. \"Brother Yuan, since you are already here, why don\'t you play with Xiao Hua?\"</p><p>\"You want me to play with you?\" He did not expect such a request from her.</p><p>\"Xiao Hua is always alone and it is boring to play with herself.\"</p><p>\"What about your family?\"</p><p>\"They are always busy and cannot play with Xiao Hua.\"</p><p>\"Is that so…\" Yuan felt sorry for her. He himself would be an outcast if it were not for his younger sister, so he knew very well what it feels like to be alone.</p><p>\"Okay, this big brother will play with you!\" He patted his chest with confidence. Due to his illness that left him unable to move even a limb, he did not have the leisure to play with his younger sister when she was young, so he saw this as an opportunity to experience what it would be like if he wasn\'t born with that illness.</p><p>\"Really? You will play with Xiao Hua?\" Her eyes glittered like the tiny stars in the sky, and her bright expression was adorable enough to soften the hearts of even the cruelest killers out there.</p><p>\"Un. What do you want to play?\"</p><p>\"Then Xiao Hua will throw the ball to you, and you will throw it back, okay?\" She placed the book down and showed him the ball.</p><p>\"Let me get some distance… Okay, I am ready.\"</p><p>And without further ado, the two began playing throwing ball, and soon after, the merry laughter of a joyous little girl would echo in the forest.</p><p>—</p><p>While Yuan was spending his time entertaining a mysterious little girl, other Players would either be strengthening themselves or trying to gain more information about this world. Everybody rushed to surpass their friends and rivals in this new game that just came out, especially those who wish to become a professional and are required to be ahead of everybody else.</p><p>Minutes quickly turned into hours, and while everyone was grinding in their own ways, Yuan continued to play with the little girl.</p><p>\'What monstrous stamina this little girl has! We have been throwing this ball back and forth for many hours, yet there is not a drop of sweat on her face! Even her small body shows no sign of fatigue!\' Yuan smiled bittered, his entire body drenched in sweat. How could he, a young man, get worn out before a little girl that\'s half his age while playing throwing ball? Although he has not moved a muscle for many years in the real world, this was virtual reality; he shouldn\'t even be sweating, let alone feeling fatigued!</p><p>\"What\'s wrong, Brother Yuan? You do not look so good… Are you sick?\" Xiao Hua\'s words dealt significant damage to his pride.</p><p>\"No… I am… just a bit… tired…\" he said in an exhausted voice.</p><p>Hearing his words, she no longer threw the ball at him. \"Then do you want to take a rest before we resume?\"</p><p>\"You… you still want to play?\"</p><p>\"Un!\" she nodded vigorously, nearly making him cry.</p><p>\"Okay… but let me rest for a bit…\"</p><p>He sits down at a nearby tree, and Xiao Hua follows him, sitting beside him.</p><p>\"Where is Brother Yuan from?\" she asked.</p><p>\"I am from a faraway place called Earth.\"</p><p>\"Earth?\"</p><p>Seeing her glittering eyes, Yuan smiled. \"Do you want to hear about my homeland? Although it is not much, I still have memories of the places I went as a child.\"</p><p>\"Yes! I want to hear stories about this Earth!\"</p><p>\"Very well, then…\"</p><p>Yuan began telling stories to Xiao Hua of the things he has done as a child, and she quickly became engrossed in his stories.</p><p>After an hour of nonstop storytelling, when he ran out of both breaths and stories to tell her, Xiao Hua opens the book in her grasp and spoke, \"Since Brother Yuan played with Xiao Hua and even told her stories, Xiao Hua shall also tell you stories,\" she said. \"This is Xiao Hua\'s gratitude to you, Brother Yuan!\"</p><p>Yuan did not refuse and humbly accepted her appreciation.</p><p>However, when she began reading the book in her hands, he was surprised to find out that he wasn\'t able to understand a single word coming out of her mouth. It sounded more like chanting than a story!</p><p>But he didn\'t want to be rude to her, so he continued to listen. Soon, without being aware, he closed his eyes. After closing his eyes, he began feeling more relaxed and comfortable, almost as though he was experiencing some kind of hypnotization.</p><p>The weird chanting from Xiao Hua became less gibberish — he was beginning to comprehend her words, and information he never knew was being fed into his head. This continued for a whole hour before a sharp sound would suddenly wake Yuan from his meditative state.</p><p>«You have learned Heaven\'s Secret Art»</p><p>\"Heaven\'s Secret Art…?\"</p><p>Xiao Hua smiled gently upon hearing Yuan\'s mumble.</p><p>And suddenly, above the sky for every player to witness, a grand system notice appears.</p><p>«Player Yuan has become the world\'s first player to have learned a Divine-rank Skill! Congratulations!»</p><p>The announcement shocked every witness there, especially those Players at the top. The game has not even been out for a day, yet someone has managed to obtain a Divine-rank Skill already?

However, it was a near-impossible task due to the way the game handled the players\' privacy.</p><p>Unlike other games where one can see the players\' names at glance, Cultivation Online did not have that feature. Unless the individual allows it, nobody would be able to see their name, not even their friends.</p><p>After spending many resources and time looking for Yuan, people quickly came to a realization that unless Yuan willingly revealed himself, his identity would remain unknown forever. But that alone was not enough to force these people into giving up on trying to find him.</p><p>The internet, game forums, even newspapers, people began offering real money for information on Yuan, even outright paying thousands for the person himself to reveal himself.</p><p>Virtual reality has become so deeply involved in the real world that it would not be an exaggeration to say that professional gamers and top rankers have more fame and respect than even the top celebrities in the world.</p><p>Some professional gamers, in fact, earn seven digits every month just from s alone!</p><p>In fact, even casual gamers can earn more money than people with normal jobs just by selling in-game items for real money!</p><p>With so much and appeal, it would only be obvious for people to want to become a gamer where they can have fun and earn money instead of choosing work that involves labor.</p><p>Furthermore, according to last year\'s gaming report, at least half of the world\'s population is a virtual gamer!</p><p>—</p><p>After throwing the ball for a few hours without breaking a sweat, Yuan suddenly stops.</p><p>\"What\'s wrong? Are you feeling tired again?\" Xiao Hua asked him.</p><p>\"My sister is calling for me; it is time for dinner,\" he said.</p><p>\"You are going to leave?\" Her expression instantly turned gloomy upon hearing his words, feeling reluctant to let him leave. She was afraid that he wouldn\'t come back once he had left.</p><p>\"Don\'t leave Xiao Hua alone!\" She hurriedly said, almost breaking into tears.</p><p>Yuan patted her head with a smile. \"I will be back to play with you later, I promise.\"</p><p>\"...You promise?\"</p><p>\"If I break my promise, then I shall swallow ten thousand needles!\" He swore clearly in a loud voice.</p><p>\"Okay… then Xiao Hua will wait for Brother Yuan here.\" She took a seat by the same tree and closed her eyes to rest.</p><p>\"Log off!\"</p><p>Yuan\'s vision blurred, and the warmth in his limbs gradually disappeared. Darkness surrounded his view, and he could no longer see nor feel anything.</p><p>—</p><p>\"Brother, how was the game?\" His sister\'s voice resounded beside him.</p><p>\"It was… fun.\" He showed a gentle smile, but deep inside, he was reluctant to leave that bright and colorful world where his body was not useless.</p><p>\"What\'s for dinner today?\" He asked her despite already knowing the answer.</p><p>\"Chicken soup!\"</p><p>Yuan smiled bitterly. He has been eating nothing but soup for the last few years, after all.</p><p>\"Here, let me help you up.\" She took off the helmet on his head before lifting his head and adjusting his body to a sitting position.</p><p>She began feeding him warm soup with a spoon soon later. \"How is the temperature?\"</p><p>\"Perfect…\"</p><p>The room became quiet with Yuan drinking soup being the only sound that could be heard.</p><p>After Yuan finished dinner that was only one large bowl of soup, she laid him back down on the bed. \"I will be right back for your cleaning,\" she said.</p><p>Moments later, she returns to the room with a towel, a bucket of warm water, and new clothes.</p><p>\"Excuse me, brother.\" She said before stripping him completely naked.</p><p>\"...Yu Rou…\"</p><p>\"What is it?\"</p><p>\"I\'m sorry…\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>The room instantly turned silent.</p><p>\"What are you saying now?

Only tonight, okay?\"</p><p>\"Un.\"</p><p>—</p><p>\"Brother Yuan, you\'re really back!\" Xiao Hua instantly stood up with a happy expression upon seeing him appear out of nowhere like a ghost.</p><p>\"I did make a promise to you,\" he patted her, who was poking her head at him with clear indications.</p><p>\"What do you want to do now that the stars are already out?\" he then asked.</p><p>\"Play games!\" She answered without hesitation.</p><p>\"I figured.\" He nodded with a smile.</p>'),(39,3,'Chapter 4 - Hidden Ques',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>Yuan continued to play with Xiao Hua throughout the night without a care in the world. Meanwhile, other Players were either trying to find the best way to strengthen themselves or were already in the process of grinding their strength.</p><p>The Players also grew addicted to their new profound strength, with the power to smash rocks with mere fists and skip meters into the distance; it gave them a sense of superiority, and it made them feel really good about themselves.</p><p align=\"center\" class=\"adsbox\" id=\"lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1\"></p><p>However, for someone who is crippled and blind in the real world, Yuan wouldn\'t mind spending all of his time just playing with Xiao Hua, who has many resemblances to his younger sister.</p><p>The world under the night sky seemed still, with the only thing moving being two shadowy figures and a ball.</p><p>\"Xiao Hua, will you be fine with playing out here till so late? Won\'t your parents be worried if you don\'t return soon?\" Yuan asked her after noticing that she has been out here playing with him for nearly the entire day.</p><p>\"It is okay. Xiao Hua is always out here playing by herself, so they are used to it.\"</p><p>\"...\" His pity towards her increased with every passing moment he spent with her. \"Xiao Hua, how about we take a rest from playing and let me tell you some more stories?\"</p><p>\"Stories?\" Her eyes began flickering like the stars in the night sky upon hearing the magic word, and she instantly sat by the tree.</p><p>Yuan followed and sat beside her. \"The stories I will be telling you today are fairy tales from my homeland.\"</p><p>\"Fairy tales? Like mythology and legends?\"</p><p>\"Well… not exactly. Fairy tales are more short stories made for entertainment rather than legends and such. They are pure fiction, so it\'s not real.\"</p><p>\"What\'s the difference?\"</p><p>\"...You will know when you hear it.\"</p><p>Yuan began telling her famous and classical fairy tales from Earth that he\'s heard when he was young such as a certain individual poisoning a girl who awakened due to a kiss from a prince, mermaids in the ocean, and pirates fighting in the sea.</p><p>While it has been many years since Yuan has heard of these stories, he was still able to recall them clearly and greatly entertain Xiao Hua, who was not used to this genre of stories.</p><p>\"These people… are they all mortals?\" She suddenly asked him.</p><p>\"To my knowledge, yes.\"</p><p>\"This is nothing like stories of mythical beasts ruling the world or immortals overturning Heaven. It is normal, yet it brings so much entertainment.\" She didn\'t know mortals could be so entertaining despite being the focus of these stories.</p><p>\"Do you have any more fairy tales to tell Xiao Hua?\" She asked.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, that was all I could remember. But I will find some more to tell you later.\"</p><p>\"It\'s a promise!\"</p><p>\"It\'s a promise.\" Yuan smiled.</p><p>\"Okay, then it is Xiao Hua\'s turn to read.\" She opened the same book she used to teach him Heaven\'s Secret Art.</p><p>\"That\'s…\" Yuan wondered if she was going to teach him another skill.</p><p>\"Although Brother Yuan has already learned the technique, you have not fully mastered it. However, with your powerful comprehension skills, Xiao Hua believes that Brother Yuan will master it in no time.\"</p><p>Thus, she began reading.</p><p>However, this time around, Yuan was only able to understand everything from the beginning only to lose comprehension later on. It felt like he was listening to a story with a plot that quickly deepens as it progresses, becoming more mysterious and profound.</p><p>—</p><p>It took Xiao Hua nearly an hour to finish reading the book that was only a dozen pages thick.</p><p>When she finished, she looked at Yuan to see the expression he was making.

Is that what that feeling was?\"</p><p>\"Un.\"</p><p>\"I see… Right, I have reached the second stage of Heaven\'s Secret Art and learned Heaven Splitting Sword Strike.\"</p><p>Xiao Hua looked at him with her eyes slightly widened more than usual, seemingly filled with surprise.</p><p>\"Good job, Brother Yuan.\" She gave him a thumbs up a moment later. \"But your cultivation base is lacking, so you will not be able to use it right away.\"</p><p>\"Right, it says I need 10,000 Qi for its activation.

If I max it out and use the skill, won\'t my Qi be depleted and I will have to cultivate until I gain it back?\"</p><p>\"Your depleted Qi will naturally recover until it returns to its original state so you will not have to cultivate every time you use a technique. However, recovering Qi naturally takes time, and it will slow down your cultivation. That is why Cultivators do not use their Qi pointlessly.\" Xiao Hua explained to him as though she was an expert. \"Additionally, if your Qi falls below a certain point, then your body will be in a weakened state until you recover your Qi. In extreme cases, you may lose consciousness or even the ability to Cultivate.\"</p><p>Yuan took his time digesting all of the information. \"So if I have 100 Qi and I use a skill that requires 10 Qi, my remaining 90 Qi will naturally recover back to 100 without the need to cultivate?\" He asked her just in case.</p><p>Seeing her nod, Yuan fully understood the system. \"So it is just like any other game but with a slight twist that requires more management. Qi is required for skills but also for a breakthrough in cultivation; it would be unwise to use it unless necessary.\"</p><p>\"Thank you, Xiao Hua. If not for you, I would still be clueless right now.\"</p><p>\"Brother Yuan, gratitude is shown with action, not with words.\" She patted her own head, causing him to laugh.</p><p>\"Right, right.

They still appear in the game with the same character!\"</p><p>\"So we are limited to one character no matter what?\" Yuan cannot comprehend the game creators\' motive for creating such a system; it\'s almost as if they want humans to live in another world with life as realistic as possible.</p><p>\"Ah, brother, it\'s time for me to go to school.

Without her, what else is there to do in this world? Strength, wealth, fame — Yuan was not interested in any of these. All he wanted to do was have fun and use his body normally, something he cannot achieve in the real world.</p><p>He pulled out the necklace she gave him before she left. Shaking his head, he sighed. \"I shouldn\'t be so impatient. I will wait for her just like she had waited for my return.\"</p><p>Thus, he sat down to cultivate again.

Player White Lotus has become the world\'s first player to have obtained a Servant!»</p><p>While Yuan wondered what type of Servant this White Lotus had obtained, everybody else was surprised to see \'Player White Lotus\' instead of \'Player Yuan\' who was thought to have another shock for the world.

Did someone obtain a Servant already?\" She asked with curiosity. \"Also, I don\'t know anything about obtaining Servants.\"</p><p>\"It was someone named White Lotus.\"</p><p>\"White Lotus!\" Yu Rou immediately recognized that name. \"She is one of the top players at the moment who has a cultivation base at Fifth Level Spirit Apprentice! Furthermore, she is actually a rich young lady in real life, too.\"</p><p>\"Fifth Level Spirit Apprentice is considered the top?\" Yuan, who is already a Seventh Level Spirit Apprentice, was surprised to hear that someone who is two whole levels behind him is at the top.</p><p>\'Are they really top players?

Since you spent most of your time fooling around, it should be pretty low, right?

I am envious.\" Yuan smiled bitterly.</p><p>\"Going to school is nothing to be envious about, brother. It is boring and tiring,\" sighed Yu Rou.</p><p>\"But I still envy you and every student out there…\" He sighed inwardly.</p><p>After talking for a few more minutes, Yu Rou went back to her room to sleep, and Yuan himself also went to sleep.</p><p>\"If she doesn\'t appear by tomorrow, I should use that necklace…\" He told himself before falling asleep.</p>'),(42,3,'Chapter 7 - Heaven Splitting Sword Strike',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>\"Xiao Hua, where are you? Your favorite brother is here to play with you!\" Yuan shouted loudly in the forest the moment he logged into the game.</p><p>\"Aiii… What am I doing?\" He sat down afterward, his hand reaching for the necklace around his neck.</p><p align=\"center\" class=\"adsbox\" id=\"lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1\"></p><p>Despite it seemingly made out of steel with a piece of jade attached, the necklace was as light as a feather, nearly weightless.</p><p>«Xiao Hua\'s Necklace»</p><p>«Grade: ???»</p><p>«Description: Obtained from Xiao Hua.»</p><p>\"Even though she said to use this to call her… how do I use it?\" He played around with the necklace as he pondered.</p><p>He tried poking it, caressing it, commanding it to open, even licking it, but alas, the necklace remained unchanged.

A loud explosion appeared in the distance, startling Yuan. What just happened? Why did the earth tremble the way it did just now? Did someone drop a bomb?</p><p>Clang! The sound of metal clashing resounded again, and a gust of wind suddenly swept the place, nearly lifting Yuan into the air.</p><p>\"Devil Meng Li! If I don\'t kill you today, then I am not Zhan Xuegang!\"</p><p>\"Ahahaha! A mere half-step Spirit Grandmaster like you think you can kill me? Today will be the day you will realize your foolish existence — in hell!\"</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>Visible ripples filled with profound power swiftly swept the sky after every clash, sending chills down Yuan\'s spine every time it swept past him.</p><p>\"It is actually two people fighting against each other that is causing this phenomenon?!\" Yuan was shocked, to say the least. \"To fight in someone else\'s garden, how disrespectful!\"</p><p>Soon, two figures could be seen fighting each other in the air from where Yuan stood. One with long red hair and one with long black hair. They were flying back and forth, throwing powerful sword strikes at each other that would create ripples upon being blocked by the other person.</p><p>\"They are flying, just like that old man!\" Yuan recalled Elder Song, the old man who gave him and thousands of other players a brief explanation about this world while standing on a sword in the air.</p><p>The fight in the air lasted for many minutes without either one gaining an advantage over the other; they seemed to be equally matched.</p><p>However, as they were getting closer and closer to where Yuan stood, the destructive ripples created by their sword clashes also became painful to bear for him.</p><p>Despite not being apart of the fight, Yuan could feel a dominating pressure making it difficult for him to breathe, and his body felt as though it was carrying a large rock.</p><p>\"Die for me! Seven Earthly Sword Strikes!\"</p><p>\"Ahahaha! Too weak! Way too weak! Bloody Sword Strike!\"</p><p>A ripple far superior to the previous swept through the place until it could no longer be seen on the horizon.</p><p>Cough! Yuan could no longer resist the pressure and coughed up a mouthful of blood. \"Damn! This is really uncomfortable!\" He wiped the blood from his mouth with his hand.</p><p>\"I can even taste the iron-like taste of blood…\" Yuan was completely immersed at this moment. The pain in his body and the realistic features of this game temporarily made him forget that this was just a game.</p><p>\"If they get any closer, I will definitely die from collateral damage!\" He began running away from the two, but the clashes between them were also getting stronger.</p><p>\"Nine Earthly Sword Strikes!\"</p><p>\"Devil\'s Blood!\"</p><p>Boom! Trees fell and the clouds scattered from the impact, and Yuan was sent flying towards a tree, losing consciousness a moment later.</p><p>—</p><p>\"Hahahaha! Zhan Xuegang, what\'s wrong? Didn\'t you say that you will kill me today?\" One of the figures began laughing while pointing at the other person who was missing an arm. \"The Prime Disciple of the Profound Sword Sect is only so-so—just like that junior sister of yours… Hahahaha!\"</p><p>\"I will… I WILL KILL YOU!\" Zhan Xuegang roared, his eyes turned red, and his cultivation base suddenly increased dramatically.</p><p>\"What!?\" The eyes of Devil Ming Li widened from shock. \"You… you had a breakthrough in the middle of our fight?!\"</p><p>\"I will avenge Junior apprentice-sister Xia today by killing you even if I have to lose all four of my limbs and become a cripple!\" His eyes and nose began bleeding, and veins appeared all over his body.</p><p>\"Was she your lover by any chance? Then let me tell you something important before you die… her body was amazing! It is truly a pity that she had killed herself so quickly or else I would have surely enjoyed her body even more! Hahahaha!\"</p><p>\"MENG LI, GO TO HELLLLLL!!!!\" The blue sword in Zhan Xuegang\'s grasp glowed a dark blue light, and killing intent soared beyond the clouds.</p><p>\"SPIRIT BLADE!\"</p><p>\"Trying to bring me down with you? Just because you are now a Spirit Grandmaster like me does not mean we are on equal standing, you fool!\" Meng Li\'s red hair glowed a crimson color along with his eyes, looking like a real devil from hell.</p><p>\"Hell\'s Fire!\"</p><p>Suddenly, before the two of them could release their techniques, a little girl in red robes appeared in-between them like a ghost, and in her grasp was a necklace covered in fresh blood.</p><p>\"For disturbing the peace of our place, your cultivation base shall be crippled as a punishment.\" The little girl waved her sleeves, and Meng Li and Zhan Xuegang felt their entire cultivation base collapse an instant later.</p><p>Without any cultivation to support them, the two were no longer able to control their attacks or fly, and they fell straight to the ground, breaking many bones upon hitting the earth.</p><p>\"Who are you?!\" Meng Li cried out loud as he laid on the ground, experiencing major pain across his body. To cripple him, a Spirit Grandmaster, with a mere wave of her sleeves, her background must be shocking.</p><p>As for Zhan Xuegang, he could only stare at the little girl in the air with wide eyes. He was too shocked to think.</p><p>\"What did we do to offend you?! Answer me!\" Meng Li shouted again after receiving no answer from her.</p><p>However, the little girl ignored him, descended from the sky to a nearby tree, and walked to where Yuan\'s unconscious body laid.</p><p>\"That\'s the trash who was watching us fight…\" Meng Li was aware of Yuan\'s presence and that he had been watching them, but because he was too weak to affect them, Meng Li treated Yuan like an ant and ignored him. The same goes for Zhan Xuegang.</p><p>The little girl kneeled to wipe the blood off Yuan\'s lips, her hands trembling slightly. \"For injuring him… you shall be punished with death…\"</p><p>After wiping the blood from Yuan\'s lips, the little girl stood and turned to face the two figures lying on the floor, her expression grim and filled with killing intent.</p><p>\"Heaven Splitting Sword Strike…\" The world suddenly trembled, and the heaven dimmed, almost turning into night. And a sword made from a golden light appeared in the grasp of the little girl.</p><p>\"Heaven Splitting Sword Strike?! Impossible! What are you doing here in the Lower Heavens?!\" Zhan Xuegang recognized the technique being witnessed, and his heart nearly stopped from shock.</p><p>The little girl ignored his question and suddenly slashed the sword downwards, and the heavens seemed to have split into two at that moment.</p><p>BOOM! A massive earthquake shook the entire Eastern Continent, shocking many experts within the continent, even alerting many ancient experts around the world.</p><p>—</p><p>Yuan slowly opened his eyes, and the first thing that he noticed was the obviously large earth fissure in front of him with an end that he cannot physically see, looking as though it separated the earth in half.</p><p>\"What—Did those two cause this?! This is ridiculous!\" Yuan\'s back was soaked in cold sweat upon seeing the earth fissure that seemed endless. He couldn\'t imagine the power that was required to cause this much destruction. This earth fissure was more than enough to change the geography of this world!</p><p>Suddenly, Yuan\'s heart jumped. He slowly turned his head, and it was this moment he realized that he had been sleeping on the soft lap of this little girl.</p><p>\"Xiao Hua!\" He was pleasantly surprised to see her sitting beside him, even allowing him to sleep on her lap. \"Are you hurt anywhere?\"</p><p>Yuan felt relieved upon seeing no injuries on her.</p><p>Xiao Hua suddenly pulled his head back down to her lap. \"Master, you shouldn\'t move too much. You are injured.\"</p><p>\"Eh?\" Yuan became dumbfounded. \"What did you just call me? Master? What kind of game are we playing this time?\"</p><p>\"This is not a game. Xiao Hua has accepted Brother Yuan as her Master.\" She showed him the necklace covered in blood with a serious expression.</p><p>\"That\'s the necklace you gave me—Oh… so that\'s what you meant by using that to call you… to summon you as a Servant?\" He facepalmed upon realizing the real meaning behind her words, making a loud slapping sound. \"Xiao Hua… you… Aiya!\" He sighed loudly.</p><p>\"Do you not accept Xiao Hua?\" Her expression saddened. \"Is Xiao Hua a bad girl?\"</p><p>\"That\'s not it. I really like you, but… to keep you as a Servant is too much… since it will cause many unnecessary misunderstandings…\"</p><p>\"Misunderstands? Xiao Hua does not mind…\"</p><p>\'But I do!\' Yuan replied inside his head.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Yuan finally said to her, \"Brother Yuan.\"</p><p>\"Huh?\" Xiao Hua looked at him with a puzzled expression on her face.</p><p>\"As long as you call me Brother Yuan like normally, then there will be no misunderstandings.\" He explained to her.</p><p>\"Then…\" Her eyes began sparkling. \"Brother Yuan!\"</p><p>She suddenly hugged him, hiding the bashful smile on her face.</p><p>«You have accepted Xiao Hua as your Servant!»</p><p>Name: Xiao Hua</p><p>Servant Grade: Divine</p><p>Master: Yuan</p><p>Cultivation: Third Level Spirit King</p><p>Legacy: Supreme Heaven\'s Legacy</p><p>Bloodline: Divine Bloodline</p><p>Physique: Purple Mist Physique</p><p>—</p><p>«Heaven\'s Secret Art»</p><p>«Rank: Divine»</p><p>«Mastery Level: 4»</p><p>—</p><p>«Heaven\'s First Secret Art — Consuming Heaven Technique»</p><p>«Rank: Divine»</p><p>«Mastery Level: 5»</p><p>—</p><p>«Heaven\'s Second Secret Art — Heaven Splitting Sword Strike»</p><p>«Rank: Divine»</p><p>«Mastery Level: 4»</p><p>—</p><p>«Heaven\'s Third Secret Art — Heavenly Domain»</p><p>«Rank: Divine»</p><p>«Mastery Level: 2»</p><p>—</p><p>«Heaven\'s Fourth Secret Art — Heaven Sealing Technique»</p><p>«Rank: Divine»</p><p>«Mastery Level: 1»</p><p>—</p><p>«Fly»</p><p>«Rank: Earth»</p><p>—</p><p>«Superior Senses»</p><p>«Rank: Heaven»</p><p>—</p><p>«Qi Manifestation»</p><p>«Rank: Earth»</p><p>—</p><p>«Purple Mist»</p><p>«Rank: Divine»</p><p>—</p><p>«Congratulations!

He\'s clearly cheating! Where are the admins? What about the game creators? He needs to be punished!\"</p><p>\"He either has balls that are hard as steel or he\'s completely nuts. To cheat so openly, does he think it wouldn\'t raise even a little bit of suspicion?\"</p><p>Rumors of Yuan cheating in the game began spreading like wildfire across the internet.</p><p>Cheaters nowadays, especially in popular games, are punished more severely than older times where cheating would only be frowned upon but nobody really tries anything major to stop them.</p><p>Furthermore, if you are caught cheating, then there is a high possibility of receiving a fine that is more expensive than ten years of rent for housing, and there are even many cases of cheaters being jailed for up to four years.</p><p>With so many risks involved, only those who are rich and really don\'t care would be willing to cheat.</p><p>However, even these types of people wouldn\'t cheat so openly. So in Yuan\'s case, people could only assume that he was completely nuts to be so obvious in the current most popular game in the world!</p><p>—</p><p>\"Cheating, huh. What do you think, White Lotus? Do you also believe this Yuan to be a cheater?\" A handsome young man in purple robes kicked the decapitated wolf head by his feet to the side. In his grasp was a steel sword with a black handle, and blue lightning snakes would coil around the blade every so often that was dripping with fresh blood.</p><p>Beside him stood two other people, both beautiful ladies.</p><p>The beautiful young lady with elegant features by his side silently stared at the announcement in the sky. \"Whether he is cheating or not does not concern me,\" she said a moment later, her gaze switching from the announcement to the large black cat beside her. \"But I am interested in what a Divine-rank Servant would look like…\"</p><p>Her Two-tailed Black Cat is a normal monster without a grade, but it has great agility and powerful attacks.

Forget about me, the entire Legacy Ranking may be thrown into disorder because of this Yuan.\"</p><p>\"I\'d be lying if I say I am not interested in this Player, but the entire Legacy Ranking?

How so?\"</p><p>\"Hmmm… That mountain over there… Xiao Hua can make it disappear with one attack.\" She pointed at the large mountain at the horizon and said casually.</p><p>\"Disappear with one attack?\" Yuan\'s eyes popped when he heard her confident words. If what she said was true, wouldn\'t that make her a walking bomb with destructive power equivalent to a nuke? One that can be used multiple times? How could she possibly be a mere Servant? Wouldn\'t her existence be considered a bit unbalanced for a game? Or are all cultivators this powerful once they reach a certain stage?</p><p>Yuan couldn\'t help but wonder what the game creators were thinking when they thought that giving such a small girl like her so much power would be a great idea.</p><p>\"Xiao Hua, do not use your powers recklessly, okay? I don\'t want to see you accidentally destroy a city or a piece of land—\" He suddenly turned to look at the earth fissure, his eyes wide open.</p><p>\"X...Xiao Hua… did you do this?\" He asked her after having a feeling that it wasn\'t the two cultivators who had created this mess.</p><p>\"Un.\" She nodded calmly, seemingly thinking nothing much of it.</p><p>\"Aiii!\" Yuan sighed loudly. \"What if you had accidentally hit somebody with that? Xiao Hua, listen up.

The Supreme Heaven,\" he asked out of curiosity, not expecting anything too much.</p><p>\"Everything,\" she answered after a moment of silence, \"The winner shall obtain everything this world has to offer… so… they become this world\'s God.\"</p><p>\"Eh?\" Yuan totally did not expect such a generous reward. \"Allowing Players to become God? So the game creators are essentially giving admin powers to those who reach that point? How generous of them.\"</p><p>\'But I have no use for such power, so I will enjoy my life to the fullest and leave it to others to fight for that reward.\' Yuan thought to himself. He was content with just having the ability to use his eyes and limbs as he wishes.</p><p>—</p><p>After walking for some time, Yuan finally realized that they were walking aimlessly without a destination. \"Xiao Hua, where should we go now? Or rather, what should we do?\" he asked her, who seemed to be the one leading this journey.</p><p>Xiao Hua looked at him with a nonchalant expression and said, \"Help Brother Yuan get stronger.\"</p><p>\"And how will we do that?\" Although he doesn\'t really desire strength, it wasn\'t something he would refuse either.</p><p>\"That…\" Xiao Hua suddenly pointed to the distance where there was an open field, and in this middle of this open field was a large figure at least 5 meters tall.</p><p>\"That\'s… a frog?\" Yuan quickly blinked a few times nonstop when he saw the massive frog with jade-like skin sitting in the middle with its eyes closed, seemingly sleeping.</p><p>\"That is a Jade Frog; it has power equivalent to a Ninth Level Spirit Apprentice cultivator.\"</p><p>\"Ninth Level Spirit Apprentice?! I am only a Seventh Level Spirit Apprentice! Are you telling me to go kill myself?!\" Yuan nearly cried upon hearing her words.</p><p>\"Although the Jade Frog is two levels above Brother Yuan\'s cultivation base, it shouldn\'t matter because Brother Yuan has cultivated the Heaven Consuming Technique, allowing him to be stronger than most Cultivators at the same level.\"</p><p>\"Is that really how it works?\"</p><p>\"Un.\"</p><p>\"But I also don\'t know how to fight — Ah… it noticed us.\" Yuan suddenly pointed at the Jade Frog, its head turned towards their direction with killing intent radiating from its gaze.</p><p>Whoosh! The Jade Frog suddenly leaped and appeared dozens of meters into the sky, almost as though it was trying to touch the clouds.</p><p>\"Watch out!\" Yuan instinctively grabbed Xiao Hua by her waist with one hand and jumped back to avoid the shadow. Seconds later, the Jade Frog lands at where they originally stood, creating a dent in the ground.</p><p>\"That was close…\" Yuan wiped the invisible sweat from his forehead when he saw the hole on the ground. They could\'ve been meat paste if he didn\'t dodge that.</p><p>\"Brother Yuan, good luck.\" She gave him a thumbs up and casually walked to the side to watch, dumbfounding Yuan.</p><p>Thinking that she was just an ant, the Jade Frog ignored her and kept its gaze on Yuan.</p><p>\"You… How am I supposed to fight this monster without any weapons?!\" he cried out loud.</p><p>\"Then Brother Yuan can use this…\" Xiao Hua retrieved a small pouch from her robes, pulling out a steel sword from inside.</p><p>However, when she pulled out the sword, it also alerted the Jade Frog, causing it to leap towards her. In the Jade Frog\'s eyes, Xiao Hua, who has a weapon, was more of a threat than Yuan who was empty-handed, so it ignored Yuan and went for her instead.</p><p>\"Xiao Hua! Watch out!\" He shouted to warn her, but Xiao Hua only watched it fall on her with a calm expression.</p><p>Boom! The ground slightly shook when the Jade Frog landed on Xiao Hua\'s small frame.</p><p>Yuan\'s eyes widened, and his jaw dropped from shock. In his mind, Xiao Hua has most likely turned into a pancake after being squashed by the Jade Frog\'s massive body and weight.</p><p>Suddenly, purple mists began seeping out from beneath the Jade Frog, almost like it had farted, and Yuan returned to his senses.</p><p>The purple mist distanced itself from the Jade Frog and gathered beside Yuan, before forming into the figure of a small girl.</p><p>\"Xiao Hua!\" Yuan was baffled by what he\'d just witnessed. What just happened?</p><p>\"What\'s wrong, Brother Yuan?\" she asked him in a normal voice as though she did not just get flattened by the Jade Frog.</p><p>\"You… what happened just now?\"</p><p>\"Xiao Hua\'s Purple Mist Physique?\"</p><p>\"Yes… but I am also talking about why you just stood there to take its attack! You nearly gave me a heart attack!\"</p><p>\"But Brother Yuan said Xiao Hua cannot use her power until Xiao Hua has permission, and Xiao Hua did not have permission…\"</p><p>Yuan looked at her with wide eyes, his expression perplexed. \"Are you an idiot?!\" he suddenly yelled at her.</p><p>Startled, Xiao Hua shrunk her head like a scared turtle.</p><p>\"Even if you didn\'t want to use your powers, you could\'ve just dodged! There was no reason for you to stand there and take the hit!\" Yuan was upset, but mostly at himself for telling her to do something without thinking about it.</p><p>Xiao Hua is just an NPC, someone programmed to act and do things a certain way, so if Yuan told her to sit, then she will sit without questioning him, her \'master\'. But Yuan didn\'t take into consideration that she was an NPC, who is also his Servant, and treated her as a real human, hence why he believed that she would have some logic in her when he told her to not use her power recklessly.</p><p>\"Sorry…\" Xiao Hua apologized.</p><p>\"Aiii!\" Yuan facepalmed when he saw her sad face. \"I should be the one apologizing, Xiao Hua… I had told you to do something without thinking... I\'m sorry.\"</p><p>\"?\"</p><p>\"When I told you to not use your powers, I didn\'t mean to completely seal off your power and be a punching bag… If you are in danger or feel like you need to use your powers, then just use it.\"</p><p>\"What about Brother Yuan\'s permission?\"</p><p>\"Forget I had ever said that and use it according to your judgment. What I am trying to say is there\'s no need to crack an egg by smashing it with a large rock, and think about your surroundings and the environment before you decide to use it.\"</p><p>\"Xiao Hua understands.\" She nodded.</p><p>\"Good. Now, give me that sword. I have a debt to settle with this damn frog.\"</p><p>The moment Yuan grabbed the steel sword by the handle, information about the sword appeared in his head.</p><p>«Spirit Sword»</p><p>«Grade: Spirit»</p><p>«Quality: Peak»</p><p>«Physical Strength Required: 900»</p><p>«Mental Strength Required: 1,500»</p><p>«Sharpness: 1,000»</p><p>«Description: Cuts metal like butter.»</p><p>\"Good sword!\" Yuan instantly took a liking to it after swinging it a few times in the air.</p>'),(45,3,'Chapter 10 - A Natural Prodigy',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>The Jade Frog remained unmoving, its gaze seemingly filled with confusion as it stared at Xiao Hua, who didn\'t even bother to return its gaze, as though it was nothing in her eyes. How did this insignificant-looking little girl escape unscathed after being crushed by its massive weight, it wondered.</p><p>Yuan walked forward in a calm manner, his gaze deeply focused on the Jade Frog. Although he has never been in a fight before, he felt oddly calm at this moment, as though it was only natural.</p><p align=\"center\" class=\"adsbox\" id=\"lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1\"></p><p>\"I have never been in a fight before, let alone use a sword. I have spent the majority of my life in a bed, silently rotting away. However, as powerless I may be outside of this world, I can use my limbs and eyes to the fullest in this world! As long as I am here, I feel as though I can achieve anything, even defeating this giant frog!\" Yuan suddenly dashed towards the Jade Frog, alerting it. His speed was faster than even the fastest man on earth, and he arrived in front of Jade Frog in the blink of an eye.</p><p>\"Witness! Remember! Learn! Execute!\" The fight between the two cultivators flashed inside his head, and his hands moved accordingly.</p><p>Slash! The sword in his grasp had easily sliced the skin of the Jade Frog, causing blood to gush out from its stomach. The Jade Frog screamed from the pain, and it jumped back to avoid him.</p><p>Xiao Hua\'s eyes widened when she witnessed the movements of Yuan\'s sword. \"Although it was stiff and seemed like the swing of an amateur… it was clearly a sword technique.\"</p><p>Yuan did not chase after the Jade Frog and only looked at the sword in his grasp, and on his face was dissatisfaction. \"Che. I moved exactly as that guy did, but something about it did not feel right…\"</p><p>\"Brother Yuan… you…\" Xiao Hua could only be shocked. What she just witnessed was the technique of one of the two cultivators she had killed. Did he learn it just from watching them fight for a brief moment?</p><p>For someone to learn and execute a technique only after watching it once and only for a few moments, Yuan could only be described as a prodigy.</p><p>\"I executed the movements perfectly and it had hit the target, but there was something missing…\" Yuan pondered. \"Perhaps… Qi?\"</p><p>As though he had received enlightenment, Yuan smiled, and his gaze returned to the Jade Frog. \"This time, I will slay you!\" he exclaimed with confidence, his sword pointing at the trembling Jade Frog.</p><p>The Jade Frog was confused. The human looked incredibly weak and vulnerable just moments ago, yet the moment he grabbed the sword, everything about him changed. His weak aura became sharp like the sword, and his gaze showed dominance, even a hint of arrogance. What had happened to him that caused this change?</p><p>Even Xiao Hua was also a bit baffled by his change. It was as if he had gone from a mortal who knew nothing about the world to a profound swordmaster! Even the aura he emitted has changed entirely!</p><p>Yuan dashed towards the Jade Frog while it was dazed, and his hands maneuvered the sword in his hands with the same movements but with more precision and speed. The sword in his hand suddenly glowed red —</p><p>\"Bloody Sword Strike!\"</p><p>Sha! The Jade Frog instinctively leaped back, but its movements were too slow when compared to Yuan\'s sword strike, and it split in half in mid-air, causing organs and blood to fly everywhere.</p><p>«You have learned Bloody Sword Strike»</p><p>—</p><p>«Bloody Sword Strike»</p><p>«Rank: Earth»</p><p>«Mastery Level: 1»</p><p>«Description: Consumes 900 Qi.

Congratulations!»</p><p>«Player Yuan has become the first player to have killed the Elite Boss: Jade Frog!»</p><p>Two announcements appeared, back to back, for the world to see.</p><p>—</p><p>After the Jade Frog died, Xiao Hua ran up to Yuan and asked him, \"Brother Yuan, where did you learn that technique?\"</p><p>The sharp aura around Yuan disappeared the moment he heard Xiao Hua\'s voice. \"Hm? Oh, it was a skill used by that red-haired dude fighting in the sky,\" he said casually.</p><p>Xiao Hua silently looked at him with her eyes flickering with admiration. \"No wonder Brother Yuan comprehended the Heaven\'s Secret Art in such a short time…\" she mumbled to herself.</p><p>\"Anyway, I feel like I have gotten stronger from that fight just now. It also felt great to use my body in such a way!\" Yuan laughed, \"Perhaps I have a talent for fighting? Hahaha!\"</p><p>\"Brother Yuan is a genius, no doubt.\" Xiao Hua nodded with a serious face.</p><p>\"Stop it… you\'re embarrassing me with your flattering…\"</p><p>\"Xiao Hua is not flattering. Brother Yuan\'s ability to comprehend things is otherworldly. Such talents are rarely seen even in the higher heavens, let alone this Lower Heaven…\"</p><p>Yuan shook his head, \"I was able to beat that frog with ease only because of the powerful sword you gave me. Thank you, Xiao Hua.\" He patted her head.</p><p>\"Then when Brother Yuan becomes strong enough, Xiao Hua will give Brother Yuan more powerful weapons!\" she said cheerfully.</p><p>\"You have equipment stronger than this sword? What are you, a walking weapon shop?\"</p><p>\"Un. But Brother Yuan is too weak to wield any of them, so Xiao Hua can only wait until he gets strong enough to wield them without exploding to death.\"</p><p>\"E...Exploding to death?\" Yuan shivered upon hearing her cruel words. \"Surely you must be joking…\"</p><p>\"Unlike normal weapons without a grade, Spirit-grade and above weapons are called Spiritual Weapons that have the ability to gain their own consciousness. If one tries to wield a Spiritual Weapon stronger than their own strength, then the conscious in the weapon may try to kill that person depending on its personality.\" Xiao Hua explained to him.</p><p>\"How dangerous… it\'s almost as if everything in this game will try to kill you if you are too weak…\" Yuan thought to himself.</p><p>\"Weapons, monsters, even humans… it does not matter… if it is strong, then it will dominate the weak. That\'s why Brother Yuan has to become strong, so he will not be bullied by the strong.\"</p><p>\"I will be fine as long as I have you, Xiao Hua.\" Yuan tried to praise her, but she only turned solemn.</p><p>\"Brother Yuan, Xiao Hua is only strong in this Lower Heaven… In the higher heavens, Xiao Hua is only an ant when compared to the real experts…\" she sighed.</p><p>\"Only an ant?\" Yuan cannot imagine how powerful the cultivators in the higher heavens are when Xiao Hua is already strong enough to destroy an entire mountain.</p><p>Xiao Hua suddenly walked away and towards where the dead Jade Frog laid.</p><p>\"Where are you going?\" Yuan followed her.</p><p>\"When monsters die, some of them will drop a monster core.\" Xiao Hua shoved her entire arm into the Jade Frog\'s corpse without flinching and pulled out a small crystal a moment later. \"Monster cores are very important to Cultivators because they can greatly assist them in cultivation with Qi stored inside.\"</p><p>\"Here you go, Brother Yuan.\" She handed Yuan the monster core.</p><p>\"What about you? Don\'t you also need to grow stronger?\" He asked.</p><p>\"The amount of Qi inside this monster core is too little to have any effect on Xiao Hua, so Brother Yuan should use it.\"</p><p>Yuan nodded, and he threw the monster core into his mouth without hesitation. \"Taste like candy…\" he thought.</p><p>\"Ah! Brother Yuan!\" Xiao Hua shouted loudly, looking baffled and scared at the same time when she saw Yuan throw the monster core directly into his mouth.</p><p>\"Hm? What\'s wrong?\" Yuan looked at her casually.</p><p>\"Monster cores are not meant to be swallowed like that!\" she said urgently, \"Hurry up and spit it out!\"</p><p>When Yuan saw her panicking face, he also panicked. What will happen to him now that he ate one?</p><p>Cold sweat soaked Yuan\'s back, but there was nothing he could do because the monster core had melted in his mouth the moment it touched his tongue and have already entered his stomach…</p><p>\"I… already swallowed it…\" Yuan spoke in a stiff tone. \"I know it is already too late, but what happens if someone swallows a monster core?\"</p><p>Xiao Hua dropped to her knees and said, \"Monster cores contain the entire cultivation base of its retainer before death, so if someone tries to swallow so much Qi in one go… they will explode to death…\"</p><p>\"Exploding to death again!?\" Yuan\'s jaw dropped from shock. There are too many things in this game that will cause him to explode to death!</p><p>Suddenly—</p><p>«Heaven Refining Physique activated»</p><p>«1,280,000 Qi has been refined from the Jade Frog\'s monster core»</p><p>«You have absorbed enough Qi for a breakthrough»</p><p>«You have reached Eighth Level Spirit Apprentice»</p><p>«All stats +450»</p><p>—</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>\"....\"</p><p>\"Brother Yuan, did you just have a breakthrough?\" Xiao Hua asked after a long silence, her voice filled with disbelief.</p><p>\"I did...\" he answered with a weird smile.</p>'),(46,3,'Chapter 11 - A Priceless Treasure',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>Xiao Hua looked at Yuan with a pondering gaze. \"Brother Yuan\'s cultivation base was only at the early stages of Seventh Level Spirit Apprentice before consuming the Jade Frog monster core. Even if Brother Yuan consumes the entire Jade Frog monster core, he shouldn\'t be able to break through to Eighth Level Spirit Apprentice right away and would only be halfway there…\"</p><p>\"Additionally, Brother Yuan also directly absorbed the entire monster core and did not receive any backlash but had a breakthrough instead… Xiao Hua has never seen anything like this before…\"</p><p align=\"center\" class=\"adsbox\" id=\"lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1\"></p><p>\"Perhaps it had something to do with my physique?\" Yuan said.</p><p>\"Brother Yuan\'s physique?\"</p><p>\"It\'s called Heaven Refining Physique,\" he said, hoping she\'d know something about it.</p><p>However, Xiao Hua only tilted her head. \"Heaven Refining Physique? Xiao Hua has never heard of it before…\"</p><p>\"But if it has something to do with why Brother Yuan was able to consume that Jade Frog monster core, then we can obtain some more monster cores to experiment.\"</p><p>\"Hmm…\" Yuan suddenly retrieved the token given to him by the goddess during his character evaluation and showed it to her. \"Then do you know what this thing is, or its purpose?\"</p><p>Xiao Hua\'s eyes instantly widened with shock when she saw the jade token in his hand. \"Ancient Spirit Jade! And so big!\" she exclaimed loudly, \"Where did Brother Yuan obtain this!?\"</p><p>\"It was given to me by some beauty. I don\'t know her name, though. What does it do?\" Yuan became curious when he saw her shocked expression, looking as though she just witnessed the heavens collapse before her.</p><p>\"This is a Spirit Jade; it is somewhat similar to a monster core but holds far more Qi within. Even a pebble-sized Royal Spirit Jade of low quality, the lowest grade, is extremely valuable in the higher heavens… since it can awaken or bestow bloodlines...\" Xiao Hua forcefully swallowed her saliva and continued, \"The Ancient Spirit Jade in Brother Yuan\'s grasp is three grades above the Royal Spirit Jade… and is probably of high quality… Not to mention it is the size of a palm-sized rock…\"</p><p>The presence of the Ancient Spirit Jade was enough to make the usually calm Xiao Hua tremble uncontrollably — it was just that valuable of a treasure.</p><p>\"Hmmm… So I can consume this and obtain Qi like monster cores, right?\" Yuan licked his lips when he thought about how sweet the Jade Frog monster core tasted. \"I wonder how much stronger I\'ll grow if I were to eat this…\"</p><p>Xiao Hua nearly received a heart attack when she heard his words and hastily grabbed his hands. \"You mustn\'t! If Brother Yuan consumes this, even if you have a unique physique, you will surely explode to death! Even a peak Spirit Emperor would not dare to imagine consuming it!\"</p><p>Yuan chucked when he saw the anxious face she made, \"Relax, Xiao Hua. I won\'t consume it. Such a valuable item, how could I consume it before I find that beauty to ask her why she gave me this Spirit Jade?\"</p><p>\'For that person to have this Ancient Spirit Jade, she must have a shocking background… Maybe someone from the Supreme Heaven?\' Xiao Hua thought to herself.</p><p>\"Xiao Hua, here.\"</p><p>\"?\"</p><p>\"!!!\"</p><p>Xiao Hua\'s soul nearly abandoned her body when Yuan suddenly threw the Ancient Spirit Jade at her. Barely catching it, she looked at him with a baffled expression. \"Brother Yuan…?\"</p><p>\"It\'d be wiser if you were to keep this Ancient Spirit Jade for me until I become strong enough to protect it,\" he said.</p><p>\"Xiao Hua cannot hold something this valuable!\" She instantly refused while shaking her head, her hands already trembling from the invisible weight coming from the Ancient Spirit Jade.</p><p>Yuan frowned, \"If you don\'t want to hold it, then who will? I am aware of my weak existence in this vast world, so having me hold something like that will only bring endless trouble. If I could, I would just throw it away, but now that I know its value… You know what I mean, right?\"</p><p>Xiao Hua clenched her fist and nodded with a serious expression. \"Xiao Hua vows to protect this Ancient Spirit Jade even at the cost of her life!\"</p><p>\"Wrong!\" Yuan said loudly. \"No matter how valuable that Spirit Jade is, it is only an object and will never be as valuable as your life! If it ever comes to losing your life or that Spirit Jade, then you will choose to lose the Spirit Jade!\"</p><p>\"But…\"</p><p>\"No buts! This is an order!\" Yuan was adamant about his decision. In his eyes, there is nothing in this world that can be as valuable as Xiao Hua\'s life.</p><p>\"...Xiao Hua understands…\" She reluctantly nodded before storing the Ancient Spirit Jade in her storage pouch.</p><p>With the Ancient Spirit Jade gone from her sight, the atmosphere was no longer as heavy and suffocating.</p><p>\'I was unable to learn more about that beauty or why she\'d give me such a valuable treasure… How unfortunate.\' Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p>—</p><p>\"Where do we go to obtain more monster cores?\" Yuan asked her with the steel sword still in his grasp, his blood still heated from the battle with the Jade Frog.</p><p>\"Any monster with a cultivation base of Seventh Level Spirit Apprentice and above will have a chance to drop a monster core,\" she said.</p><p>\"Then what are we waiting for? Let\'s get hunting!\"</p><p>Xiao Hua began leading Yuan around to find monsters for him to fight.

This is a rule set by Heaven itself and cannot be defied. But… from Brother Yuan\'s situation… perhaps his Heaven Refining Physique can ignore this rule and defy the Heavens?\" Xiao Hua trembled at the thought that Yuan could possibly have a heaven-defying physique.</p><p>\"Defying the heavens, huh…\" Yuan thought of his real body in real life. \"If only I had such an ability in my other life, too…\" he sighed inwardly.</p><p>Suddenly, Xiao Hua turned her head, and her gaze narrowed. \"Brother Yuan, there are people near us…\"</p><p>\'Hm?

All I did was court senior apprentice-sister Xing… but because senior apprentice-brother Ren also fancies her… my actions angered him…\"</p><p>\"Are they dating?\"</p><p>\"No…\"</p><p>\"Aiya!\" Yuan facepalmed, making a loud slapping sound. \"He wants to kill you because you went ahead and confessed your love to this Xing girl? What kind of unreasonable man is this senior apprentice-brother Ren of yours?\"</p><p>Mo Zhou became dumbfounded by his words. \"But… this type of situation happens all the time…?\" he thought to himself.</p><p>Yuan glanced at the Fiery Lizard corpse. \"You need that, right?\" he asked while pointing.</p><p>\"...Yes.\"</p><p>\"Take it.\"</p><p>\"Eh?\" Mo Zhou looked at him with a face full of surprise. This Fiery Lizard monster core is no doubt a valuable treasure that even the sect elders would covet, yet this young man was willing to give it to him, who he just met, just like that?</p><p>\"Really…?\" Mo Zhou mumbled in a doubtful tone. \"But it was you who killed it…\"</p><p>\"Then I\'ll just take it for myself–\" Yuan turned to walk towards the corpse.</p><p>Seeing his actions, Mo Zhou quickly panicked. \"Wait! I want – No, please let me have it! I, Mo Zhou of the Flying Sword Sect, will be forever in your debt!\"</p><p>\"Brother Yuan is really kind. If it were anybody else, they would have definitely kept it for themselves.\" Xiao Hua thought to herself as she watched Mo Zhou fall to his knees to kowtow to Yuan as a way to show his gratitude.</p><p>\"If there is anything this savior needs from this Mo Zhou, he will do it without fail!\" Mo Zhou said loudly with tears falling off the corner of his eyes.</p><p>Having never been in such a situation, Yuan didn\'t know how to react to Mo Zhou\'s actions. \"No need to be so humble. If I can exchange a mere monster core for someone\'s life, of course, I will do it without hesitation,\" he said.</p><p>\"Thank you! Thank you very much…\" Mo Zhou stayed kowtowing. \"Not only did you already save me once from the Fiery Lizard… you are also giving me this Fiery Lizard monster core… In such a short time, you have already saved my life twice! Please, accept this as my gratitude…\"</p><p>\"It is awkward seeing a grown man such as yourself in this position while crying… hurry and stand up already…\"</p><p>–</p><p>It took a moment, but Mo Zhou eventually calmed down.</p><p>\"I haven\'t gotten your name yet…\"</p><p>\"You can call me Yuan.\"</p><p>\"Then, fellow Daoist Yuan, once again, I am Mo Zhou, an outer disciple of the Flying Sword Sect.\" Mo Zhou stretched his hands for a handshake.</p><p>\"Flying Sword Sect? What\'s a sect, again?\" Yuan asked, forgetting that he\'d already heard of such a word when he first arrived in this world.</p><p>Mo Zhou instantly became dazed at his question.</p><p>\"Brother Yuan, a Sect is an organization dedicated to the practices of cultivation, where people go to study cultivation.\" Xiao Hua explained to him.</p><p>\"So in other words… a school for cultivators?\" Yuan looked at Mo Zhou, and a profound light flashed in his eyes. \"Hey, Mo Zhou, can you give me a tour around your Flying Sword Sect? I have never been to a sect before, you see…\"</p><p>Mo Zhou trembled, waking up from his daze. \"So you really are a rogue cultivator…\" he mumbled in a voice of disbelief.</p><p>\"Rogue cultivator?\" Yuan looked at Xiao Hua with a question mark floating on the top of his head.</p><p>\"They are independent cultivators that do not belong to any sect.\"</p><p>\"Oh, I understand. But why do you look so shocked?\" He turned to look at Mo Zhou.</p><p>\"I can tell that Daoist Yuan is a Ninth Level Spirit Apprentice, but he was able to slay that Fiery Lizard that even Third Level Spirit Warriors would have trouble, and you even killed it with such ease…\"</p><p>\"What he is trying to say is Brother Yuan, who does not have the support of Sects, shouldn\'t be this powerful,\" Xiao Hua intervened.</p><p>She looked at the dumbfounded Mo Zhou and said, \"Brother Yuan is special. Don\'t compare him with these geniuses. Even these so-called Chosen are nothing in front of Brother Yuan.\"</p><p>\"Ah, you are making me blush with such a bashful statement…\" Yuan sighed in a low voice, his face slightly red.</p><p>\"No – as arrogant as it may have sounded, I believe it… that Daoist Yuan is no doubt a genius.\" Mo Zhou said with a serious expression. \"As for visiting my Flying Sword Sect… I will have to get permission from my sect elder before I can say for sure…\"</p><p>\"Really? Then what are we waiting for?\" Yuan said cheerfully. He didn\'t expect that he\'d have the chance to go to school in a video game, something he did not have the luxury of doing in the real world due to the limitations on his body.</p><p>\"Ah! Give me a second to retrieve the monster core…\" Mo Zhou said hastily, nearly forgetting about it.</p>'),(49,3,'Chapter 14 - Thousand Swords Formation',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>\"Bloody Sword Strike!\"</p><p>A red arc of light swept through the forest and directly beheaded the three meters tall ape without alerting it.</p><p align=\"center\" class=\"adsbox\" id=\"lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1\"></p><p>«Your comprehension with Bloody Sword Strike has reached a new level»</p><p>«Bloody Sword Strike Mastery Level (1) → (2)»</p><p>«Bloody Sword Strike»</p><p>«Rank: Earth»</p><p>«Mastery Level: 2»</p><p>«Description: Consumes 90,000 Qi. Must wield a sword to activate. A technique from the Blood Sect.»</p><p>When Yuan noticed how the Qi consumption had increased a hundred folds with a single mastery level increase, his jaw dropped from shock. Wouldn\'t his Heaven Splitting Sword Strike require one million Qi to activate at mastery level 2 at this rate?</p><p>\"Fellow Daoist Yuan is really… incomprehensible…\" Mo Zhou trembled in shock as he watched Yuan slay high-level monsters with ease, and all in a single strike. \"Even that high-level Spirit Apprentice Bull Ape was slain in a single strike...\"</p><p>Ever since they met and decided to visit the Flying Sword Sect, Yuan would hunt down every monster in their path, collecting a few more monster cores.</p><p>\"Eleven so far, huh…\" Yuan counted the number of monster cores he had obtained, and the bundle of glistening monster cores in Yuan\'s grasp dumbfounded Mo Zhou to the core, who thought he was in an auction house.</p><p>\"So many monster cores!\"</p><p>Mo Zhou exclaimed loudly. Monster cores are all valuable resources that greatly assist cultivators with their cultivation, and they are greatly desired by cultivators from all levels. And because they can only be acquired through high-level monsters, they are considered rare and hard to obtain. But now in front of his eyes, there are a dozen of them all gathered on one man\'s palm.</p><p>\"You consider this many? It won\'t even fill the gap between my teeth if I eat them all…\" Yuan sighed.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>Mo Zhou couldn\'t comprehend the meaning behind his words, but he had a premonition that he would regret it if he knew, so he decided to ignore it.</p><p>–</p><p>\"We have been running into a lot of high-level monsters, haven\'t we? That was already the sixth one…\" Mo Zhou pondered as another high-level monster falls to the ground with its head detached from its neck.</p><p>\"You really like beheading things…\"</p><p>\"It\'s efficient and easy, after all.\" Yuan smiled casually: \"Tch. No monster core from this one…\"</p><p>\"Easy, huh…\"</p><p>Mo Zhou inwardly compared Yuan with the Chosen in his sect. Would they be able to say such bold words so casually? Would they also be able to behead high-level monsters with such ease? Most likely not.</p><p>A thought suddenly appeared in Mo Zhou\'s head: \'Since he is a rogue cultivator… there is a chance I can rope him into joining our Flying Sword Sect…?\'</p><p>If the Flying Sword Sect accepted a genius like him into their ranks, they will surely be overjoyed. Hell, they may even consider him a candidate as a future Sect Leader!</p><p>\"Say, Daoist Yuan… have you ever considered joining a Sect?\" he decided to ask him.</p><p>Yuan thought about it for a moment and shook his head: \"I did not know of the existence of these so-called \'Sects\' until today, so no, I have never thought about it.\"</p><p>\"Then… would you be interested in joining my Flying Sword Sect? I am sure the Sect will welcome you with wide arms.\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>While Yuan pondered, Xiao Hua decided to open her mouth and speak: \"Brother Yuan, there is no need for you to join a Sect; it will only hinder your growth. Xiao Hua believes that Brother Yuan will grow stronger much faster when together with Xiao Hua as a rogue cultivator.\"</p><p>Mo Zhou\'s mouth dropped when he heard Xiao Hua\'s words. Because she has been silent, he didn\'t really pay much attention to her. He wondered about their relationship.</p><p>\"If I ever join a Sect, it\'d only be for fun,\" said Yuan. \"However, it is still too early for me to join any Sect, so I will have to refuse that offer for now.\"</p><p>\"Is that so…\"</p><p>While Mo Zhou was dispirited due to Yuan refusing his offer, he understood that there was still hope for him to join the Flying Sword Sect in the future. \"Then, if you ever feel like joining a sect, please come to my Flying Sword Sect.\"</p><p>\"I\'ll keep that in mind.\"</p><p>–</p><p>After walking for a few more hours, the group finally arrived at a vast valley surrounded by high mountains.</p><p>\"This is the Flying Sword Sect?\" Yuan was mesmerized by the scene of the thousand swords hovering in the air above the valley, looking as though there was a roof made of swords covering the place.</p><p>\"That\'s the Thousand Swords Formation; it is a Heaven-ranked battle formation. If activated, they will all attack at once, like a rain of arrows. Though, it has been over 100 years since it was last activated.\" Mo Zhou wanted to leave a deep impression on Yuan with the Sect\'s power, hoping it would increase the chances of him join the Sect.</p><p>Mo Zhou\'s words and the magnificent scene indeed left a deep impression within Yuan, who has never seen anything like this before. As for Xiao Hua, she only glanced at it for a second before looking away.</p><p>\"Please wait here for a moment while I go ask for permission to give you a tour around as a guest.\"</p><p>\"Un.\" Yuan nodded and waited outside for him.</p><p>__</p><p>\"A genius rogue cultivator, you say?\" An old man sat in his exquisite wooden chair, his gaze as the young man standing before him.</p><p>\"That\'s right, Elder Jiang. He managed to slay a high-level Fiery Lizard with a single sword strike, even piercing its steel-like scales known for its impenetrable defense!\" Mo Zhou shared his experience with Yuan to the old man before him.</p><p>The old man was Elder Jiang, a sect elder of the Flying Sword Sect, who was also in charge of the administration for the sect.</p><p>\"If this young man is really as good as you praised him to be, then I\'d like to meet him myself.\" Elder Jiang stood up and walked towards the door. \"What are you waiting for? Let\'s go.\"</p><p>\"Yes!\"</p><p>Mo Zhou led Elder Jiang outside the sect where Yuan and Xiao Hua waited patiently.</p><p>\"Fellow Daoist Yuan! Thank you for waiting… umm…\"</p><p>\"Hmm… Ninth Level Spirit Apprentice… how old are you, young man?\" Elder Jiang could tell Yuan\'s cultivation base with a single glance.</p><p>\"You seem to be around Mo Zhou\'s age… not bad for a rogue cultivator who cultivated without any proper guidance.\" He nodded with approval.</p><p>\"You are…?\"</p><p>\"This is Elder Jiang, he is in charge of the sect\'s administrations for the Outer Court disciples.\" Mo Zhou introduced Elder Jiang to Yuan.</p><p>\"I see. Nice to meet you, Elder Jiang.\"</p><p>Elder Jiang gently brushed his white beard and said, \"I will get straight to the point, do you want to join my Flying Sword Sect as a disciple? The Sect provides countless benefits and resources to its disciples to help them grow. If you join, then your cultivation base will definitely rise faster than before. Perhaps you may even qualify to become an Inner Court disciple one day.\"</p><p>\"Inner Court disciple?\" Yuan wondered if Inner Court disciples meant being something like an upperclassman.</p><p>\"You…\"</p><p>Elder Jiang frowned and looked at Mo Zhou.</p><p>\"Elder Jiang, you see… Daoist Yuan has actually never been aware of the existence of sects until today, hence why he wanted to visit our Flying Sword Sect…\" Mo Zhou explained to him with a bitter smile.</p><p>\"What…? How is that even possible?\" Elder Jiang doubted his words, but even an idiot could come up with a better excuse.</p><p>Elder Jiang looked at Yuan again, and he sighed. \"Whatever. I do not care about your circumstances. Well? What is your answer? I will accept you as an Outer Court disciple right this moment if you so wish.\"</p><p>Mo Zhou saw the chance and urged Yuan. \"Daoist Yuan, you are really lucky! Under normal circumstances, one would have to pass the entrance exam before they get admitted into the sect as a disciple. However, Elder Jiang here has the authority to accept you into the sect without any of that hassle! This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance that anyone would be willing to die for!\" he said with excitement.</p><p>\"...\" Yuan turned silent for a moment.</p><p>However, despite the enticing offer, Yuan still shook his head. \"Although I appreciate the gracious offer, I will have to decline…\"</p><p>\"Why?!\" Mo Zhou exclaimed. How could anybody let such a chance go to waste? This could be his ticket to becoming an Inner Court disciple of a great sect such as the Flying Sword Sect – a chance every Outer Court disciple like Mo Zhou would die for!</p><p>\"Like I have already said… I am not yet ready to join any factions. I am currently waiting for someone, and until she arrives, I will not make any big decisions,\" said Yuan.</p><p>Xiao Hua glanced at Yuan when he mentioned that he was waiting for someone. Who could this person be?</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>\"...Very well…\" Elder Jiang said with his eyes closed, \"If that is your decision then so be it. However… do not come back one day and ask for my generosity again as you have already lost it once.\"</p><p>Mo Zhou sighed. All of his efforts were wasted in such a short amount of time. Perhaps the reason Elder Jiang did not put any real effort into pursuing Yuan was that he still doesn\'t fully trust his words – that Yuan was a prodigy that even Inner Court disciples may not be able to match.</p><p>\"Umm… about the tour… am I still allowed to see your sect?\" Yuan asked with a sly expression; he still wanted to see the inside even after all that he\'s said.</p><p>Mo Zhou looked at Elder Jiang with the corner of his eyes, waiting for his answer.</p><p>Elder Jiang coldly snorted and said, \"Let him see what he\'s missed out.\"</p><p>He walked away afterward.</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Yuan was speechless. Refusing Elder Jiang\'s offer must have offended him.</p><p>Mo Zhou sighed again and said with an apologetic expression, \"Don\'t worry about it too much, Daoist Yuan. It was my fault to begin with… If I hadn\'t spoken so highly of you in front of Elder Jiang with the intention of recruiting you then this would\'ve never have happened.\"</p><p>Yuan shook it off and said, \"I don\'t mind it. He\'s just a grumpy old man, after all.\"</p><p>\"G-Grumpy old man… Daoist Yuan… please don\'t ever let him hear you say that in front of him or else he will definitely kill you…\" Mo Zhou, with a terrified expression, turned to see whether or not Elder Jiang had heard Yuan. When he couldn\'t see Elder Jiang\'s figure, Mo Zhou sighed in relief.</p><p>\"Forget about him and let\'s hurry and go inside. I have been itching to see the inside since the sight of the Thousand Sword Formations!\" Yuan said in an urging tone.</p><p>Mo Zhou smiled bitterly and said, \"Alright… follow me…\" He turned around and led the two inside, where disciples could be seen bustling around.</p><p>\"Wow… they all carry swords with them…\" Yuan\'s eyes flickered with excitement. He couldn\'t be more excited at this moment. In his eyes, this place was just begging for him to explore!</p>'),(50,3,'Chapter 15 - The Stone Tablets',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>\"That building over there is the cafeteria for Outer Court disciples like me.

That is where disciples go for lectures from Sect Elders once a week.\"</p><p>\"That tall building is where disciples train to sharpen their sword techniques,\" said Mo Zhou as he pointed to the pagoda that was in the distance.</p><p>\"What a unique shape for a building…\" Yuan silently admired the elegant tower.</p><p>\"Do you think I can go inside for a closer look?\" he then asked Mo Zhou, who quickly shook his head in an apologetic manner.</p><p>\"I\'m sorry, Daoist Yuan, but visitors are not allowed inside any building with a ceiling…\"</p><p>\"Che. What a stinky place. How will you attract new disciples if you block off everything?\" Yuan shook his head in pity.</p><p>\"Uhh…\" Mo Zhou didn\'t know how to refute his ignorant statement and could only smile awkwardly. Because normally, one wouldn\'t tour around a Sect before deciding whether they want to join or not.</p><p>\"Forget it.\" Yuan suddenly said. \"Let\'s continue with the tour.\"</p><p>Mo Zhou heaved a sigh of relief when Yuan didn\'t continue the topic.</p><p>\"Okay, then let me show you what disciples of the Flying Sword Sect deem as the most important thing in this Sect!\"</p><p>\"Ohh?\"</p><p>Hearing his words, Yuan instantly became curious about this place.</p><p>After walking for a few minutes, they stopped in front of three tall stone tablets sitting beside each other.</p><p>These three stone tablets were perfectly rectangular and had dozens of names engraved on it, resembling a memorial for the dead. However, unlike the other two, the middle stone tablet only had a few names on it, and they were much bigger and sharper than the rest.</p><p>\"What\'s this? A memorial for the dead?\" Yuan opened his mouth to ask without thinking.</p><p>\"Wha—\" Mo Zhou looked at him with a scared look. He then looked around to see if anybody was there to hear his words.</p><p>After seeing that the place was empty, Mo Zhou heaved another sigh of relief.</p><p>\"Daoist Yuan, even though I am aware of your ignorance about Sects, what you\'d just said had greatly offended not only me but also every disciple in this Sect!\"</p><p>\"What?\" Yuan looked at him with a baffled expression.</p><p>\"This is not a memorial for the dead but a ranking for the entire Sect! Every name on these three tablets represents a genius within the Sect, and they are all respected by the thousands of disciples in this Sect! If others besides me had heard your words, they would\'ve jumped at you with their swords raised, as that was extremely disrespectful to the individuals that have poured their sweat and blood just to be on that ranking!\"</p><p>\"I-Is that right? I had no idea, but I will still apologize for my rude remarks... Sorry.\" Yuan said in an apologetic tone.</p><p>Seeing his sincere apology, Mo Zhou nodded with an approving smile. \"It\'s fine. I know you didn\'t mean it.\"</p><p>He then turned to the three stone tablets again and said: \"Every stone tablet except the middle one holds forty-five names, with the middle having only ten, adding up to a total of one hundred names.\"</p><p>\"These hundred names are the names of the strongest disciples within the Flying Sword Sect— not including the Sect Elders and the Sect Leader. And every single one of them receives the Sect\'s full backing, allowing them to enjoy almost an unlimited amount of resources provided by the Sect. Ah... and everybody in the middle stone tablets is given the title \'Core Disciple\'.\"</p><p>Mo Zhou\'s eyes sparkled with admiration as he stared at the three stone tablets, especially when his gaze met with the middle one, seemingly mesmerized.</p><p>\"Every disciple in this Sect— including me— desires to have our own names engraved on the stone tablet.\"</p><p>Suddenly, as Mo Zhou ended his words, the last name on the third stone tablet disappeared. And a few seconds later, another name engraved itself on the very same spot.</p><p>When Mo Zhou saw this, his eyes flickered with excitement.</p><p>\"Look! Someone just replaced the 100th name!\"</p><p>\"Eh? How did the names on the tablet change itself? Aren\'t they engraved into it?\" Yuan was more curious about the phenomenon than the event itself.</p><p>—</p><p>After staring at the stone tablet for a few moments, Yuan suddenly noticed the name \'Ren Fuchen\'.</p><p>He pointed to the first stone tablet and asked Mo Zhou in a curious tone: \"Hey, that Ren Fuchen… is he the same as the Ren that you had offended?\"</p><p>When Yuan mentioned Ren Fuchen, Mo Zhou\'s complexion noticeably paled.</p><p>He then nodded in a dispirited motion, confirming Yuan\'s curiosity.</p><p>\"His name is ranked… 14th. He\'s the 14th strongest disciple in this place?\"</p><p>Mo Zhou nodded again but even slower this time.</p><p>\"What about the girl you were courting? Is she also on the ranking?\"</p><p>Hearing his question, Mo Zhou silently pointed to the last name engraved on the middle stone tablet.</p><p>\"Xing Aiying… ranked 10th…\" Yuan then turned to look at Mo Zhou with a surprised look. \"You actually courted someone that has her name on the ranking — the middle one, no less? How bold and aspiring!\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Mo Zhou could only smile bitterly at Yuan\'s words that were seemingly filled with admiration and praise.</p><p>\"Anyway, this is pretty much all there is to see, for guests like you at least,\" Mo Zhou said.</p><p>\"Now I have to give this Fiery Lizard monster core to senior apprentice-brother Ren…\" Mo Zhou sighed in a dejected manner.</p><p>\"Do you really have to give it to him? You didn\'t do anything wrong, so there\'s no reason for you to listen to his nonsense,\" said Yuan.</p><p>Mo Zhou shook his head and said, \"You don\'t understand, Daoist Yuan. This is a world where the strong makes the rules and the weak obey their rules, even if such rules are unreasonable and full of nonsense.\"</p><p>\"And I\'m telling you that only an idiot would follow such rules,\" Yuan shrugged. \"You are the one who doesn\'t understand here.\"</p><p>\"A-An idiot?\" Mo Zhou looked at him, who\'d unknowingly called everybody in this world an idiot, with a weird expression on his face.</p><p>\"How about I come with you to meet this Ren guy?\" Yuan suddenly said, dumbfounding him.</p><p>\"It\'s fine,\" Mo Zhou said a moment later with a bitter smile, \"This is my own problem, I cannot drag you into it, especially not after all that you\'ve done for me already.\"</p><p>Yuan turned silent and looked at him with a calm expression.</p><p>\"Is that so? Then—\"</p><p>Suddenly, a loud voice resounded from the distance.</p><p>\"Hey, isn\'t that the kid who tried to court senior apprentice-sister Xing and ended up offending you?\"</p><p>Both Yuan and Mo Zhou turned to look in the direction of the voice, and Mo Zhou\'s face paled the instant he saw the two handsome young men in the distance looking at him.</p><p>\"S-Senior apprentice-brother Ren! Senior apprentice-brother Zhen!\"</p><p>When Yuan saw how Mo Zhou\'s legs were shaking like jello, he knew just how fearful he was towards these two individuals.</p><p>\"Mo Zhou, you bastard! How dare you make me walk to your living quarters to look for you!\" The handsome young man on the right approached Mo Zhou with an angry expression, his hands grasped tightly into fists.</p><p>\"Where have you been hiding? Didn\'t I say that today was the last day for you to bring me a monster core from a Fiery Lizard or else—?!\"</p><p>\"I have it! I have a Fiery Lizard monster core with me! Here you go!\"</p><p>Mo Zhou pulled out a small red crystal from his robe pockets and showed it to Ren Fuchen.</p><p>\'That brat really managed to obtain a Fiery Lizard monster core!\' Ren Fuchen\'s eyes widened upon seeing the crystal. He did not think that someone as weak as Mo Zhou would have the ability to slay a powerful beast like the Fiery Lizard, yet there was its monster core in his grasp.</p><p>\"How did you get it? Don\'t tell me you bought it?\"</p><p>\"It doesn\'t matter how I obtained it! I have gotten what you asked, so leave me alone from now on!\"</p><p>\"Hahahaha!\" Hearing his words, Ren Fuchen burst out laughing. \"You really are an idiot! You really think that I\'d leave you alone just because you somehow managed to obtain the monster core? That was only an excuse for me to beat you up!\"</p><p>\"What?!\" At this point, Mo Zhou\'s heart was filled with bitterness. \"You promised that you\'d forget about me courting senior apprentice-sister Xing if I give you the Fiery Lizard monster core!\"</p><p>\"Of course, I will honor my words and forget about your disgraceful act of courting senior apprentice-sister Xing. However, after you give me the Fiery Lizard, it will no longer be about that. How dare a lowly trash such as yourself have feelings for senior apprentice-sister Xing! Just your feelings are enough for you to get beaten!\"</p><p>Mo Zhou trembled uncontrollably upon hearing those words. Just his love for his senior apprentice-sister Xing is enough to get beaten? Where is the justice in that? But alas, he was weak and Ren Fuchen was a Chosen — their status in this world was simply too far apart.</p><p>\"Wow, what a statement!\" Yuan suddenly said loudly, causing Mo Zhou\'s body to mysteriously stop trembling. \"Beating someone up just because they love the same person as you? What a messed up personality you have there.\" Yuan laughed out loud, almost like he was watching a funny movie.</p><p>\"And who the fuck are you? You are clearly not a disciple of this Sect, so how did you get in here?\" Ren Fuchen finally noticed Yuan and Xiao Hua standing by the side.</p><p>\"Who am I? I am the person who gave him that Fiery Lizard monster core,\" said Yuan, his expression calm.</p><p>\"Daoist Yuan!\" Mo Zhou looked at him with wide eyes.</p><p>\"Hoh? So you are the one…\" Ren Fuchen looked at Yuan with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\"Why did you give him something as precious as the Fiery Lizard monster core? What did he offer in return?\" he asked.</p><p>\"He didn\'t give me anything, nor do I want anything from him. I gave him it simply because I felt like it,\" Yuan casually replied.</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Although he didn\'t know who Yuan was, Ren Fuchen was wary of him. After all, what kind of normal individual would give away something as valuable as a Fiery Lizard monster core for free?</p><p>\"And? What do you want?\"</p><p>\"I\'d appreciate it if you stop bullying him,\" said Yuan with a smile.</p><p>\"And what if I said no?\" While Ren Fuchen didn\'t want to offend someone as mysterious as him, he wasn\'t afraid of him. Not only is he a Chosen but they are still inside the Flying Sword Sect, where he has protection in every direction.</p><p>\"Of course, you will refuse….\" Yuan turned to look at Mo Zhou and said, \"I have already saved his life once, it won\'t be weird if I do it again, right?\"</p><p>\"You…\" Ren Fuchen instantly frowned at his words.</p><p>\"Daoist Yuan!\" As for Mo Zhou, he looked at Yuan with tears in his eyes, his gaze filled with admiration, and his heart filled with gratitude.</p>'),(51,3,'Chapter 16 - A Battle Maniac',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>\"I do not know which hole you crawled from, but consider this is your last warning!\" Ren Fuchen said as he unsheathed the sword by his side, causing the aura around him to change.</p><p>Yuan looked at Ren Fuchen with a smile.

Let\'s go! I have been wanting to test my sword on something that\'s not monster for once!\" Yuan also retrieved his sword.</p><p>When Ren Fuchen saw Yuan\'s sword that was emitting a powerful and sharp aura, his eyes widened with shock.</p><p>\"A Spirit-grade sword… and it\'s even peak quality! He actually has a peak quality spiritual weapon!\"</p><p>Any weapons with a grade are considered precious treasures, as they are always many times stronger than normal weapons, especially weapons with higher quality.</p><p>And although Yuan\'s sword is only at the lowest grade, Spirit-grade, a peak quality weapon is something that even someone like Ren Fuchen, who is ranked 14th overall in this entire Sect, does not have.</p><p>Ren Fuchen frowned deeply after realizing that Yuan had a peak quality weapon whilst he only held a medium quality weapon. His attitude also changed, and he no longer looked at this situation as calmly as before. After all, he is already at a disadvantage before the fight even started! Compared to Yuan\'s peak quality weapon, his medium grade quality is akin to a wooden stick!</p><p>\"What are you standing there for? If you don\'t want to fight then just say so.\" Yuan said to him when he doesn\'t move even after many moments, his voice with a hint of provocation.</p><p>\'No! Although he has a superior weapon, I have the advantage in terms of Cultivation base! He\'s only a ninth level Spirit Apprentice whilst I am a fifth level Spirit Warrior! There\'s no way I could lose even if he has a peak quality weapon!\' Ren Fuchen encouraged himself with such logic.</p><p>Even if Yuan has a peak quality weapon, if he does not have the Cultivation base to use its full potential, it will actually burden him instead.</p><p>\"If you hand over that weapon as an apology, then I don\'t mind forgiving you for everything you\'ve done up to this point, and I will even stop bothering Mo Zhou. How does that sound?\"</p><p>Before Yuan could even open his mouth to speak, Xiao Hua opened her mouth for the first time, \"Brother Yuan, this will be good practice for you. Although you have familiarized yourself with beasts, you have yet to fight another human and to be honest, you will most likely be fighting more humans than beasts in the future.\"</p><p>Yuan nodded and raised his sword to stand in an offensive stance. He had no intention of avoiding this fight, as he already considered this as an in-game event.</p><p>\"Good! Then I shall take it off your dead body!\"</p><p>Ren Fuchen roared as he charged towards Yuan with the sword in his grasp raised high in the air.</p><p>\"Triple Sword Strike!\"</p><p>Ren Fuchen connected three attacks together in the blink of an eye, making it seem as though he attacked three times with a single movement.</p><p>Yuan\'s eyes widened at his approach, but he was not shocked. Instead, he was watching Ren Fuchen\'s attack closely, almost as if he was analyzing it.</p><p>In the next instant, Yuan raised his sword, blocking all three strikes with a single move.</p><p>\"What?!\"</p><p>Ren Fuchen exclaimed in surprise after Yuan perfectly blocked his attack.</p><p>However, despite blocking it perfectly, Yuan was pushed back slightly from the power created by someone five whole levels above him.</p><p>\"Amazing…\"</p><p>Yuan looked at his trembling hands with a wide smile on his face.</p><p>\"This tingly and numbing sensation… What a great feeling!\"</p><p>Yuan, whose real body cannot feel anything, was excited to experience such a feeling for the first time, and it made him feel alive.</p><p>\"Is he crazy?\" Ren Fuchen looked at Yuan\'s smiling face and thought to himself.</p><p>\"Come! Let\'s fight even more!\"</p><p>It was Yuan\'s turn to be aggressive this time.</p><p>\'Could Brother Yuan be a battle maniac?\' Xiao Hua wondered to herself.</p><p>\"Bloody Sword Strike!\"</p><p>The blade of the sword suddenly glowed red, and killing intent filled the place.</p><p>\"?!?!?!?!\"</p><p>Ren Fuchen nearly crapped his pants when he realized that Yuan had just used an Earth-grade sword technique.</p><p>\"Impossible! You are clearly only a Spirit Apprentice! How could you possibly use an Earth-grade sword technique!\" He gasped in shock.</p><p>Ren Fuchen hastily raised his sword to block the incoming attack.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The moment their swords collided, Ren Fuchen felt as though he was clashing against a mountain, and his knees were forced to the ground by the tyrannical pressure pressing down on him!</p><p>The next instant, Ren Fuchen noticed cracks appearing across his sword.</p><p>\"Not good! At this rate, he will break my weapon!\"</p><p>\"Help me!\" he suddenly called out to his fellow disciple that had been on standby.</p><p>In the next moment, the disciple retrieved his sword and approached them at high speed.</p><p>\"Daoist Yuan! Watch out!\"</p><p>Mo Zhou couldn\'t react in time to block the disciple and yelled out loud to warn Yuan of the incoming danger.</p><p>However, Yuan did not even turn to look at the disciple and swung his sword, throwing Ren Fuchen many meters into the distance.</p><p>Once Ren Fuchen was out of the picture, Yuan turned to face the second disciple.</p><p>\"Bloody Sword Strike!\"</p><p>He activated the same skill and quickly swung his sword, sending an arc of light towards the surprised disciple.</p><p>The disciple, who was not the least prepared for such a strike, could only watch as the arc speed towards his direction and separate one of his limbs.</p><p>\"AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!! MY ARM! MY ARM!!!\"</p><p>The disciple dropped on the floor and screamed in agony while clutching the right side of his body.</p><p>\"Oops…\"</p><p>Yuan had acted purely on instinct and did not really mean to cut off the disciple\'s arm, even feeling bad for him afterward.</p>'),(52,3,'Chapter 17 - Blood Sec',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>\'H-He should be fine, right? This is just his reaction as an NPC, right? His arm will regrow as if nothing happened after I leave, right?\' Yuan tried to convince himself so that he\'d feel less guilty for cutting the disciple\'s arm.</p><p>\"Y-You bastard! I will fucking kill you!\" Ren Fuchen roared in anger, but he was secretly fearful of Yuan\'s tyrannical strength. Even now, his arms are shaking from Yuan\'s strike.</p><p align=\"center\" class=\"adsbox\" id=\"lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1\"></p><p>\"It\'s not my fault he jumped into our fight,\" Yuan directed the blame towards the disciple, which caused the disciple to cough up a mouthful of blood upon hearing his words.</p><p>\"AHHHH! HELP ME! I\'M BLEEDING TO DEATH!\"</p><p>The disciple continued to yell at the top of his lungs, but the nearby disciples did not assist him, as they did not want to be caught up in their ruckus.</p><p>Eventually, the disciple\'s voice reached Elder Jiang\'s ears, who was sipping tea not too far from the place.</p><p>Throwing his tea down, Elder Jiang leaped into the air and approached the noise. The way he jumped from rooftops to rooftops made it seem as though he could control the gravity around him, allowing him to be weightless.</p><p>When he arrived, Elder Jiang\'s eyes widened with shock at the puzzling situation. He then quickly reacted by stopping the blood from spurting out of the disciple\'s arm.</p><p>Once he fixed the problem by placing some sort of seal around the disciple\'s arm, Elder Jiang wiped the sweat from his forehead and turned to face Mo Zhou.</p><p>\"What the hell is going on here, Mo Zhou?!\"</p><p>He directed his anger towards Mo Zhou, who was trying his best not to piss his pants from listening to the disciple\'s agonizing screams.</p><p>\"T-T-This… T-They confronted us with hostility, and in order to protect me, Daoist Yuan sparred with senior apprentice-brother Ren… When senior apprentice-brother was on the verge of losing, senior apprentice-brother Huang tried to back-stab Daoist Yuan, which resulted in this situation…\"</p><p>\"Daoist Yuan? That child?!\"</p><p>Elder Jiang turned to look at Yuan, who was trying to hide the bloody sword in his hand behind his back while awkwardly smiling at him.</p><p>\"This child, who is only a ninth level Spirit Apprentice, defeated not only Huang Ding but also Ren Fuchen, one of the top Inner Court disciples?\"</p><p>Elder Jiang couldn\'t believe his ears. Although Cultivators achieving victory against people with a higher Cultivation base is not that uncommon, such a large skip in level is unheard of!</p><p>\"It doesn\'t matter who is right or wrong here right now, but is this how you repay my generosity for letting you inside as a guest? I don\'t care what background you came from, prepare to face the consequences for attacking a disciple of the Flying Sword Sect!\"</p><p>Elder Jiang began approaching Yuan, who felt something amiss here. They are clearly the ones in the wrong for confronting him, and he even defended one of their disciples from getting bullied, yet he\'s going to be punished?</p><p>Sure, he did slice that disciple\'s arm off, but that was an accident that could\'ve been prevented if he didn\'t jump in the middle of their match.</p><p>\"It doesn\'t matter who is right or wrong? Although I do not belong here, don\'t I have the right to be safe as a guest in your house? One of your students provoked me into fighting him, but you don\'t care about that. Your own students are being bullied by their fellow students in plain sight, yet nobody even bothered to prevent it. If this is how you act as a teacher of this place, then I don\'t think you should be a teacher!\" Yuan said what was on his mind without saving any face for Elder Jiang.</p><p>\"How dare you! Who are you to lecture me?!\" Elder Jiang\'s eyes turned red from anger, clearly provoked by Yuan\'s words.</p><p>Seeing Elder Jiang emit faint killing intent, Xiao Hua also silently prepared herself. If Elder Jiang so much as tries to hurt Yuan, she will not hesitate to kill him.</p><p>Just as Elder Jiang prepared himself to punish Yuan for speaking out of line, a sudden voice resounded in his ears.</p><p>\"Wait.\"</p><p>Elder Jiang instantly halted his movements and turned to look behind him.</p><p>When he saw that it was a middle-aged man with sharp features and a dominating presence standing behind him, his eyes widened with shock.</p><p>\"S-Sect Leader!\"</p><p>Not only Elder Jiang but everybody there exclaimed loudly.</p><p>\"Step back, Elder Jiang. I will personally take care of this.\"</p><p>\"What?!\"</p><p>Elder Jiang was shocked speechless, but he didn\'t dare refuse and silently nodded.</p><p>Once Elder Jiang stepped back, the Sect Leader stepped forward.</p><p>He then looked at Ren Fuchen and Huang Ding and spoke, \"I have been watching since the beginning.\"</p><p>His words dumbfounded the two, causing them to tremble in fear.</p><p>\"How pathetic. Not only did you lose a two on one but you also had the audacity to attempt a back-stab. Where did you learn to fight like cowards? I do not recall teaching this type of swordsmanship in my Sect! I will surely discipline both of you afterward.\"</p><p>Ren Fuchen\'s expression paled upon hearing the Sect Leader\'s words. Knowing his character, they will surely be experiencing hell after this. As for Huang Ding, he directly fell unconscious after hearing the Sect Leader\'s words.</p><p>\"What is your response?!\" The Sect Leader suddenly roared.</p><p>\"Y-Yes, Sect Leader!\" Ren Fuchen replied in a cracked voice.</p><p>\"Hmph.\" The Sect Leader coldly snorted.</p><p>He then turned to look at Yuan. \"That technique you used just now… You must be from the Blood Sect.\"</p><p>\'The Blood Sect?! That evil place?!\' Elder Jiang cried inwardly.</p><p>He didn\'t expect someone innocent-looking like Yuan to be apart of that vile place! If he\'d known, he would have never allowed him inside this place!</p><p>\"I do not want any trouble with you or your place, so please just leave us alone. As for this incident, it was our fault, so you don\'t have to worry about anything.\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Everybody there was speechless watching their domineering Sect Leader act so humble before someone way younger. Not many of them even have heard of this Blood Sect, so they were also puzzled.</p><p>\"Uhhh…\" Yuan was also speechless. He didn\'t expect the situation to make such a turn and was at a loss of what to do.</p>'),(53,3,'Chapter 18 - Mo Zhous Gratitude',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>After standing there and pondering for a moment, Yuan decided that it would be better for him and Mo Zhou to just acknowledge being a disciple from the Blood Sect.</p><p>\"That\'s right, I am indeed from the Blood Sect,\" he said with a confident voice.</p><p align=\"center\" class=\"adsbox\" id=\"lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1\"></p><p>\"And I don\'t mind pretending what happened today did not occur, but you have to promise me that my friend, Mo Zhou, will no longer be bullied by his fellow disciples.\"</p><p>\"Daoist Yuan!\" Mo Zhou couldn\'t believe his ears and began crying. Why would Yuan go this far for him when he didn\'t do anything to really deserve this treatment?</p><p>\"Mo Zhou, huh?\" The Sect Leader turned to look at Mo Zhou for a moment before saying, \"You will be my disciple starting today! Anyone who dares to touch you will have to answer me!\"</p><p>\"What?!\"</p><p>When the Sect Leader made his announcement, everybody there gasped in shock, Mo Zhou included.</p><p>\"Greet your new Master!\" The Sect Leader continued.</p><p>Mo Zhou immediately kowtowed on the ground and bowed to him.</p><p>\"This disciple greets Master!\"</p><p>\"Good! Starting today, you will be training under me!\"</p><p>\"Yes!\"</p><p>Mo Zhou replied with enthusiasm in his voice.</p><p>Although Yuan did not expect such an outcome yet again, he was more than satisfied.</p><p>\"Then I will be taking my leave,\" he said.</p><p>The Sect Leader nodded and looked at Mo Zhou again, \"Go guide our guest to the exit!\"</p><p>\"Yes, Master!\"</p><p>Thus, Mo Zhou brought Yuan and Xiao Hua away from the crowd.</p><p>Once they were gone, Sect Elder Jiang spoke, \"Sect Leader… making Mo Zhou your disciple is a little bit…\"</p><p>\"Hmph!\" The Sect Leader coldly snorted. \"If you hadn\'t noticed by now, the sword technique used by that child is one of the Blood Sect\'s most powerful technique!\"</p><p>\"What?! Does this mean—\"</p><p>\"That child is definitely not just your average disciple from the Blood Sect. Judging from his prowess and ability to fight those many realms above himself, I won\'t be surprised if his Master is the Blood Sect\'s Master himself, Lord Blood!\"</p><p>\"Lord Blood!\" Elder Jiang trembled in fear just by hearing his name.</p><p>\"And if someone like him calls Mo Zhou his \'friend\', then there\'s a high possibility that the Blood Sect will help us if we are ever in danger because of their relationship. If that\'s the case, then I won\'t hesitate to make him my disciple, even if it will make many disciples unhappy!\"</p><p>Elder Jiang stared at him with a gaze filled with admiration. \'To think that the Sect Leader would be thinking so far ahead just to keep his Sect safe! It\'s no wonder why he\'s the Sect Leader!\'</p><p>\"Sect Leader is sharp and wise, to think I doubted your decision even for a moment. Please, forgive me.\"</p><p>\"If you want to be forgiven, then take care of the rest of this mess!\" The Sect Leader said before walking away.</p><p>The news of Mo Zhou, a mere Outer Court disciple, suddenly becoming the Sect Leader\'s disciple came out of the blue and shocked every disciple within the Flying Swords Sect, especially those already at the top.</p><p>\"What?! How could a nobody like Mo Zhou be chosen as the Sect Leader\'s disciple when the rest of us have been working our asses off just for that spot?!\"</p><p>\"The Heavens are unjust! This world is unfair!\"</p><p>No doubt many people began to despise Mo Zhou because of his luck and bullshit, but alas, with the Sect Leader behind his back, who would dare to touch him now?</p><p>Outside the Flying Sword Sect, Mo Zhou dropped to his knees and kowtowed to Yuan, who was slightly taken back by his behavior.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" Yuan tried to lift him off the floor.</p><p>\"Daoist— No! Brother Yuan! Everything you have done for me, I do not know if I will ever be able to repay you but I will do my best as the Sect Leader\'s disciple and will one day return this debt!\"</p><p>Yuan smiled and casually waved his hands, \"Don\'t worry about it. Like I\'d already said many times, I am not doing this because I want any reward.\"</p><p>\"No! This is not a reward! I am doing this because I want to, just like you!\" he quickly responded.</p><p>Yuan could tell that Mo Zhou will not change his mind no matter what he says at this point so he only shook his head inwardly and accepted the outcome.</p><p>\"Fine, do whatever you want.\"</p><p>\"I will!\"</p><p>\"And good luck with that girl you fancy, I\'m rooting for you.\"</p><p>\"R-Right…\" Mo Zhou began blushing.</p><p>\"Then, I\'ll be leaving. I have already caused too much trouble in your place.\"</p><p>Yuan began walking away.</p><p>\"Take care, Brother Yuan!\" Mo Zhou waved at him from the Flying Sword Sect.</p><p>A few moments later, after Yuan left the Flying Sword Sect, messages appeared before his eyes:</p><p>«Congratulations!

You have unlocked Fame!»</p><p>«Due to your actions at \'Flying Sword Sect\', your Fame has increased by 10!»</p><p>«Fame: Increases as you make a name for yourself.»</p><p>Yuan nearly received a headache from the number of notifications being spammed.</p><p>\"Where should we go now?\" Yuan asked Xiao Hua as they left the area.</p><p>\"Hmm...\" Xiao Hua pondered as their figures entered the forest.</p>'),(54,3,'Chapter 19 - Spirit Warrior',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>As they traveled further away from the Flying Sword Sect, Xiao Hua thought to herself, \'It\'s only been a few days since Brother Yuan became a Cultivator, yet he is already powerful enough to hold his own against Spirit Warriors, even though he\'s only a Ninth Level Spirit Apprentice. This kind of growth is unheard of and is terrifying, to say the least. His experience with the sword is also increasing at a frightening rate, almost like he\'s the reincarnation of a Sword Emperor.\'</p><p>\"Besides wandering around aimlessly for valuable resources and collecting monster cores, there is really nothing else to do.\"</p><p align=\"center\" class=\"adsbox\" id=\"lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1\"></p><p>\"Additionally, because Brother Yuan is already a Ninth Level Spirit Apprentice, he has to attain enlightenment before he can make a breakthrough and become a Spirit Warrior.\"</p><p>Xiao Hua turned to look at Yuan and spoke, \"Brother Yuan, what would you like to do? Even if you keep consuming monster cores to fill your Qi, once you reach the peak of the Spirit Apprentice realm, you will not be able to gain more Qi unless you become a Spirit Warrior.\"</p><p>\"How do I become a Spirit Warrior?\" he asked her.</p><p>\"To become a Spirit Warrior, you must comprehend the enlightenment that will come naturally once you reach the peak of the Spirit Apprentice realm. However, whether you will really gain enlightenment or not will depend on your fate and talent.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean by that?\"</p><p>Yuan expressed puzzlement.</p><p>\"Although most people are born with the capability to cultivate, their max potential is predetermined before birth. For example, whilst Brother Yuan may be able to reach the peak of the Spirit Apprentice realm with ease, you might not gain enlightenment that is required to breakthrough to the Spirit Warrior realm, thus forever remaining a Spirit Apprentice.\"</p><p>\"That being said, albeit valuable and hard to find, there are plenty of treasures out there that can help one exceed their limit and rewrite their fate.\"</p><p>Although she did not say it, Xiao Hua actually has a few of these treasures on her, so even if Yuan is destined to remain as a Spirit Apprentice forever, she can help him escape such a fate.</p><p>Yuan looked at his Qi Experience as he listened to Xiao Hua speak.</p><p>1,519,395/3,840,000</p><p>\"If I consume 3 more monster cores, it should be more than enough to max out the Qi Experience…\" Yuan thought to himself.</p><p>Suddenly, without thinking too much about it and excited to experience this enlightenment, Yuan retrieved three monster cores and threw them into his mouth all at once.</p><p>«Heaven Refining Physique activated»</p><p>«900,500 Qi has been refined from the Blood Ape\'s monster core»</p><p>«895,415 Qi has been refined from the Vampire Wolf\'s monster core»</p><p>«730,650 Qi has been refined from the Scaled Boar\'s monster core»</p><p>3,846,000/3,846,000</p><p>«You have absorbed enough Qi for a breakthrough»</p><p>«Because your Qi Experience is already full, you will not be able to receive anymore Qi until you reach the next realm»</p><p>The notifications disappeared for a few seconds before returning.</p><p>«You have met the requirements for a breakthrough»</p><p>«You have reached First Level Spirit Warrior»</p><p>«Your \'Enhanced Senses\' has developed into \'Advanced Senses\'»</p><p>«You have learned Enhanced Strength»</p><p>«All stats +1,000»</p><p>—</p><p>«Advanced Senses»</p><p>«Rank: Mortal»</p><p>«Description: Sharply enhances the functions of all available senses permanently.

Let\'s go!\"</p><p>Yuan and Xiao Hua approached the city gate.</p><p>\"What are they doing?\"</p><p>As they approached, Yuan noticed the crystal ball in one of the guards\' grasp.</p><p>\"It\'s to inspect the visitors. Unless Brother Yuan is a wanted criminal, you don\'t have to worry about it.\"</p><p>Yuan nodded.</p><p>A few minutes later, they reached the guards at the gates.</p><p>\"Entrance fee is 1 silver for each individual,\" said the guard once they got close enough.</p><p>\"Uh… Xiao Hua, do you have any money?\" Yuan, who was penniless, looked at her with an awkward expression, feeling slightly embarrassed to be asking such a little girl for money.</p><p>But alas, Xiao Hua shook her little head.</p><p>\"What the hell. Do you want to enter this place without money? Where did such beggars come from?\" The guards sneered inwardly when they realized that they were dealing with penniless people.</p><p>\"If you have no money, then I cannot allow you inside,\" said one of the guards. \"Get out of the way already! There are people behind waiting for you!\"</p><p>Yuan sighed and prepared to leave.</p><p>However, before he could even take a step, the person standing behind him spoke, \"If you want, I can pay for your entrance fee.\"</p><p>Yuan turned to look at the person who just spoke; it was a pretty young lady wearing a pair of fine robes.</p><p>\"If you don\'t mind…\" Yuan spoke with an embarrassed face.</p><p>\"Young Lady, we shouldn\'t bother ourselves with these two beggars…\"</p><p>The old man standing beside the young lady suddenly mumbled into her ears, unaware that his words were heard by Yuan, who has enhanced senses.</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>However, Yuan decided to ignore the old man\'s disrespectful remarks.</p><p>\"As the young lady of the Xuan Family, how could I ignore people in need of help?

Although it\'s not much, please accept this as my gratitude.\"</p><p>Yuan pulled out a Monster Core and placed it in front of the young lady, who immediately covered her mouth in surprise.</p><p>\"B-Blood Ape Monster Core! This is simply too much for two mere silvers! I cannot accept this!\" The young lady quickly refused.</p><p>Most Blood Apes are around the Eighth Level Spirit Apprentice Realm, and their monster cores would usually fetch at least 100 gold coins in the market place! If she accepted this monster core, it would make her feel guilty for taking advantage of Yuan.</p><p>\"Don\'t worry, I have no more use for this quality of monster core, and it\'s only something I picked up during my travel here.\" Yuan understood the reason for the young lady\'s hesitation but continued to urge her to accept it.</p><p>The pretty young lady looked at Yuan\'s honest face and the shiny monster core in his hands and forcefully swallowed.</p><p>\"Since you insist, I will accept it…\" she accepted the Blood Ape Monster Core with trembling hands.</p><p>Once the monster core was off his hands, Yuan said to Xiao Hua, \"Let\'s go.\"</p><p>\"W-Wait! What\'s your name? I am called Xuan Wuhan!\"</p><p>\"You can call me Yuan,\" he responded.</p><p>\"Thank you, Yuan! If you need help with anything, you can find my Xuan Family in Spring City!\" Xuan Wuhan then handed Yuan a medallion made of metal and imprinted with the word \'Xuan\'.</p><p>Yuan casually accepted the medallion without thinking too much about it.</p><p>«\'Xuan Wuhan\' has been added to your Bond!»</p><p>«Xuan Wuhan\'s Bond has increased to Acquaintance!»</p><p>\"Then, I will see you around,\" he said before leaving with Xiao Hua.</p><p>After Yuan left, the old man beside Xuan Wuhan spoke, \"Young Lady, why did you give him the family medallion? That is not something strangers should hold.\"</p><p>\"That young man… despite his young age, there was a formidable aura around him. He\'s most likely a genius cultivator from some large family. If I can be friends with him, it will benefit our Xuan Family, not to mention his honest character. I like people like him.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure about his background? He wasn\'t able to take out two silvers just now…\" The old man remained doubtful.</p><p>\"Were you even watching just now? He handed me a Blood Ape Monster Core worth over 100 gold coins without batting an eyelid because I gave him two silvers! That is not something even I would do! He must be testing people on purpose!\"</p><p>\"B-But why would he do something like that? What would he accomplish by testing others?\"</p><p>Xuan Wuhan shook her head and spoke, \"Just like my grandfather, the more profound and powerful the individual, the less sense they make. It is not something people like us can fathom.\"</p><p>\"Are you saying that the young man just now is as powerful as the Ancestor, who is a Spirit Master? That\'s a bit…\"</p><p>\"Of course, not. I am just saying.\" Xuan Wuhan said. \"Anyway, let\'s go. We cannot miss the auction, or we will have to deal with my father\'s angry shouting later.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Yuan and Xiao Hua wandered around the city aimlessly.</p><p>\"Xiao Hua, we need to earn some money. How about we sell the monster cores we hunted on our way here? They seem quite valuable,\" he said.</p><p>\"Un. One monster core will easily sell for over 100 gold and will last us for a while, and we still have four of them.\"</p><p>\"Then the question now is where to sell these monster cores…\"</p><p>\"If you want the most money out of the monster cores, we can look for an auction house. Although it might take some time, we will get the most profit out of it. If you do not mind selling them for much cheaper, any regular store that deals with monster cores will do the job,\" said Xiao Hua.</p><p>\"An auction house, huh? That sounds kind of fun. I have never been to one before. But where can we find one?\"</p><p>\"Most big cities will hold an auction every few weeks, not to mention this Spirit City, one of the four biggest cities on this continent. We should find one with relative ease if we ask around.\"</p><p>Yuan nodded.</p><p>\"If it won\'t take too long, I will use the auction house to sell my monster cores. But if we have to wait a few weeks, I\'d rather just sell them for cheaper.\"</p><p>After deciding their next course of action, Yuan began asking around in hopes to find an auction house to sell his monster cores, as he did not want to experience today\'s humiliation any more in the future.</p>'),(56,3,'Chapter 21 - Azure Phoenix Auction House',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>After walking around for half an hour and speaking to many people about the auction houses in this city, only one name came up repeatedly.</p><p>\"This Azure Phoenix Auction House seems very popular. Let\'s give it a look,\" said Yuan.</p><p align=\"center\" class=\"adsbox\" id=\"lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1\"></p><p>Xiao Hua nodded and followed Yuan to the location of this Azure Phoenix Auction House.</p><p>According to the people Yuan spoke with, the Azure Phoenix Auction House is one of the wealthiest and most influential auction houses within the Eastern Continent. What\'s more, they are backed by the Azure Phoenix Sect, one of the most powerful backgrounds in this world.</p><p>\"We are really fortunate to have arrived in this city right on the day it opens, right, Xiao Hua?\"</p><p>\"En.\" Xiao Hua nodded her little head.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix Auction House only opens once every three years because they have to stock up valuable treasures, and coincidentally, they came at the exact day it would open.</p><p>After walking around the Spirit City that occupies miles of land for many minutes, Yuan and Xiao Hua have finally arrived at the Azure Phoenix Auction House\'s entrance.</p><p>\"Wow, this large place is the auction house?\" Yuan couldn\'t help but become amazed by the luxurious building before him that took up an entire street.</p><p>\"Excuse me, is this the Azure Phoenix Auction House?\" Yuan asked one of the people there just in case.</p><p>Once he confirmed that they were at the right place, Yuan approached one of two pretty young ladies standing silently by the entrance, assuming she was one of the workers here.</p><p>\"Hello, do you work here?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I do,\" she replied with a gentle voice.</p><p>\"Great! I came here today because I would like to sell something here.\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>The young lady looked at Yuan with a weird face after hearing his words.</p><p>\"Umm… I\'m sorry, but we stopped accepting things for the auction a month ago,\" she said a moment later.</p><p>\"What…?\"</p><p>Yuan stood there with a dumbfounded look.</p><p>The young lady chuckled and spoke, \"Is this your first time at an auction house?\"</p><p>\"Yes…\"</p><p>\"Then let this sister teach you something about them. If you wish to sell something using auction houses, you must let them know ahead of time so they can put it on a list to let the guests know. People won\'t go to auction houses if they don\'t know what will be sold, you know? They have to prepare, too.\"</p><p>\"I see… that makes sense…\" Yuan sighed, feeling disappointed and slightly frustrated.</p><p>\"Looks like I will have to sell these monster cores elsewhere…\"</p><p>\'Spirit Apprentice Realm monster cores?\' The young lady noticed the monster cores in Yuan\'s hands and shook her head inwardly.</p><p>Even if Yuan was in time to sell his monster cores, the Azure Phoenix Auction House wouldn\'t accept something so insignificant. In fact, even if he brought Spirit Warrior Realm monster cores, the Azure Phoenix Auction House wouldn\'t even give it a glance.</p><p>The young lady did not want to disappoint Yuan anymore, who was clearly ignorant of many things, so she remained quiet.</p><p>However, the other worker there, who has been watching them since the beginning, burst out laughing, \"Hahaha! Does this kid actually want to sell that trash at our Azure Phoenix Auction House?! This is hilarious!\"</p><p>\"Lian Rong! Why must everything that comes out of your mouth be so foul? He\'s clearly very young and ignorant! There\'s no need to mock him!\"</p><p>The young lady beside Yuan frowned at her fellow worker\'s unsightly behavior.</p><p>\"Hmph! I am only speaking the truth! And the earlier he learns, the faster he will grow up! Why are you even protecting a beggar like him, Na Ying?\" Lian Rong coldly snorted, her gaze filled with mockery.</p><p>\"Don\'t mind her, little brother. It\'s not a crime or disgraceful to be ignorant at times. \" Na Ying tried soothing Yuan, acting like his next-door friendly sister.</p><p>\"What\'s wrong with you, Na Ying? Are you perhaps charmed by this kid? Hahaha! I wonder how the disciples at Azure Phoenix Sect will react once they learn of this!\" Lian Rong continued laughing.</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Although Yuan did not mind Lian Rong\'s mockery, the little girl standing beside him was boiling with anger.</p><p>\'This insignificant little ant has no idea who she\'s mocking! Brother Yuan is a genius among genius — a prodigy that will shock even the Upper Heavens! One day, Brother Yuan will become a figure that stands above all! I cannot allow him to continue being mocked!\'</p><p>\"Are you done embarrassing yourself yet? Even I am starting to feel ashamed just by being beside you!\" Na Ying shook her head.</p><p>\"You—! Are you looking for a fight, Na Ying?!\"</p><p>\"Oh? Do you want to fight me? Are you sure about that, senior apprentice-sister?\" Na Ying narrowed her eyes, and the cultivation base of an expert at the peak Spirit Warrior Realm emitted from her body.</p><p>A bead of sweat appeared on Lian Rong\'s forehead after feeling Na Ying\'s pressure.</p><p>\"J-Just you wait! Once we return to the sect, I will—\"</p><p>\"What\'s with the commotion here?!\" A strong voice suddenly resounded.</p><p>A few seconds later, an old woman appeared in front of them with an annoyed face.</p><p>\"Senior Chang!\"</p><p>Both of the girls immediately stopped their argument and bowed to the old woman.</p><p>\"Do not forget where the two of you are right now! Regardless of your status at the Azure Phoenix Sect, you are working for me now! And I will not tolerate this kind of behavior at my Azure Phoenix Auction House!\"</p><p>\"I am sorry…\"</p><p>They quickly apologized.</p><p>\"Enough. I will deal with you two afterward. The guests are already seated. Close the doors and come inside,\" said Senior Chang.</p><p>\"Wait!\"</p><p>Just as Senior Chang turned around, a cute but overbearing voice stopped her steps.</p><p>\"X-Xiao Hua?\" Yuan looked at her with wide eyes.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" he whispered in her ears.</p><p>\"Don\'t worry, Brother Yuan. Xiao Hua will deal with this,\" she responded with a smile on her face.</p><p>\"Who the hell is this little girl?\" Senior Chang frowned when she sensed a profound aura surrounding Xiao Hua\'s tiny body. It gave her a dreadful feeling.</p><p>\"Are you the owner of this place?\" Xiao Hua suddenly asked.</p><p>\"That\'s right. And who are you?\" Senior Chang responded.</p><p>However, Xiao Hua did not immediately respond and pulled out her storage pouch.</p><p>Then, right before their eyes, Xiao Hua pulled out a blue dagger from the pouch.</p><p>The instant the dagger was revealed to the world, an unfathomable presence suddenly appeared and enveloped the place.</p><p>\"This presence—!!!\" Senior Chang stumbled backward and nearly fell on her butt when she saw the dagger and sensed its aura.</p><p>\"This dagger is a Heaven-grade weapon at the peak quality — Heavenly Frost Dagger,\" said Xiao Hua, and she continued in a calm manner, \"Who I am is not important right now. What is important, though, is that I had planned to sell this dagger at your Azure Phoenix Auction House. However, because one of your workers mocked Brother Yuan and angered me, I am now having second thoughts.\"</p><p>After a moment of silence, Senior Chang\'s stiff body began trembling.</p><p>\"Who?! Who dared to offend you?! I will kill that bastard for you!\" Senior Chang\'s attitude took a sudden turn, shocking both Lian Rong and Na Ying, who has never seen her this agitated before, acting as though someone had just killed her son.</p><p>Even Yuan couldn\'t help but look at Xiao Hua with wide eyes. Since when did they come here to sell that dagger? And why does she feel so different right now?</p><p>\"That girl over there!\" Xiao Hua wasted no time pointing her small fingers.</p><p>Senior Chang turned to look at Lian Rong, who was as pale as a ghost right now, looking like all of her blood had just been drained out of her body.</p><p>\"What have you done, Lian Rong?!\" Senior Chang roared at her with a furious expression.</p><p>\"I…I...I…\"</p><p>Unable to respond and filled with despair, the young lady named Lian Rong fell to her knees, even pissing her pants due to fear.</p><p>Na Ying covered her mouth from shock as she witnessed this unexpected turn of events.</p><p>What\'s going to happen now?</p>'),(57,3,'Chapter 22 - VIP Room',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>\"Senior Chang, this is what had happened…\" Na Ying began explaining to her the events that took place right before she\'d arrived.</p><p>\"You… you foolish thing!\" Senior Chang was speechless.</p><p align=\"center\" class=\"adsbox\" id=\"lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1\"></p><p>To think that Lian Rong, someone usually with keen eyes and great intelligence to misjudge a hidden expert due to her arrogance.</p><p>\"There is nobody you can blame but yourself for being so arrogant and failing to recognize Mt. Tai!\" she shook her head.</p><p>\"Please! Senior Chang! You can\'t kill me! I am an Inner Disciple from the Azure Phoenix Sect!\" Lian Rong began begging for her life.</p><p>\"I am not the one who will decide whether you live or die today! You are begging the wrong person!\"</p><p>After hearing Senior Chang\'s words, Lian Rong immediately ran to Yuan and kotowed before him, and she begged him with a face filled with tears and snot.</p><p>\"Please, Young Master! This lowly one has failed to recognize someone as prestigious as you!\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Yuan was speechless. This is the first time he\'d seen a young lady begging for him to spare her life.</p><p>\"Young man, although she has wronged, I would also like to request for your forgiveness. After all, she is an Inner Disciple of the Azure Phoenix Sect. If you kill her, they will surely…\"</p><p>Yuan suddenly raised his hand and stopped her sentence.</p><p>\"Wait a moment. I never said anything about killing her. You were the one who spoke such words. Do not try to act as though I was the one who wants her dead.\"</p><p>\"I… I understand. Lian Rong! Be grateful! This young man has decided to spare your life!\"</p><p>\"Thank you, benefactor!\" Lian Rong cried.</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Yuan couldn\'t but help find these peoples\' behavior weird and unnecessarily exaggerated. Why must she be executed for mocking him? If he was to kill anyone that has offended him, who knows how many people will die.</p><p>\'I hope this won\'t become a trend amongst NPCs…\' Yuan silently prayed.</p><p>\"Ummm… now that everything has been settled… are you willing to sell your Heaven-grade dagger at our auction house? I promise you that you will not regret it! 80… no! You will receive 90% of the revenue, and we will only take 10%! Normally, it would be 75/25, but because we have troubled you today, I am willing to make it 90/10!\" Senior Chang suddenly said.</p><p>In fact, Senior Chang did not care about the revenue of the Heavenly Frost Dagger. All that matters to her was the reputation that would come from selling it.</p><p>The last time a Heaven-grade weapon was sold at the Azure Phoenix Auction House was one hundred years ago, and it was only a low-quality weapon at that time! As for a Heaven-grade weapon at the peak quality — this would be the first one in their thousands of years of history!</p><p>Once the world learns of this, the Azure Phoenix Auction House will surely skyrocket in popularity, and they will receive much more attention and guests in the future!</p><p>\"You are asking the wrong person. I am not the owner of that weapon — she is.\" Yuan pointed to Xiao Hua, who was casually holding the dagger as though it was a normal weapon.</p><p>\"En. I am willing to sell it but only under one condition.\" Xiao Hua said. \"You must also sell his monster cores at your place.\"</p><p>\"Okay! I accept that condition!\" Senior Chang immediately accepted without even needing to think about it.</p><p>Even if the Azure Phoenix Auction House loses a bit of face or becomes a laughing stock for selling Spirit Apprentice level monster cores, the Heaven-grade weapon will make up for it and more!</p><p>\"Xiao Hua…\" Yuan smiled warmly after realizing her intentions. To think that she\'d be willing to sell such a precious item just for him, he couldn\'t thank her enough.</p><p>\"Are you sure, Xiao Hua? That\'s a precious item, right? You don\'t have to force yourself to sell it. I can sell the monster cores elsewhere.\" Yuan said to her.</p><p>When Senior Chang heard Yuan\'s words, she felt the urge to beat him up and seal his mouth shut.</p><p>\"It\'s only a Heaven-grade weapon, Xiao Hua has many more of them. And Brother Yuan does not use daggers, so it would only continue collecting dust.\" Xiao Hua said, dumbfounding Yuan.</p><p>\'How can one have so many rare items but no money at the same time?\' he wondered where she got all of these items from.</p><p>A few moments later, Xiao Hua handed the Heavenly Frost Dagger and the four Spirit Apprentice level monster cores from Yuan to Senior Chang.</p><p>\"If you steal anything, I will destroy this place.\" Xiao Hua gave Senior Chang a stern warning before following Na Ying, who was assigned to serve them, to one of the VIP rooms.</p><p>After they left, Senior Chang sighed a breath of relief.</p><p>\"Even though she\'s a little girl, her attitude and presence are beyond normal, almost like that of an Immortal\'s! Not to mention that she actually dared to take out a peak quality Heaven-grade weapon out in the open! Even idiots would not dare steal from her...\" Senior Chang felt the chills just thinking about her.</p><p>Just as Senior Chang began walking, she noticed that Lian Rong was sitting on the floor with a dazed face.</p><p>\"Use this chance and change that arrogant attitude of yours. Even if you are an Inner Disciple of the powerful Azure Phoenix Sect, there are countless people in this world that you shouldn\'t offend.\"</p><p>\"Yes, Senior…\" Lian Rong nodded.</p><p>\"Anyway, hurry up and return to work. I\'m not paying you guys to stand around and be depressed all day,\" said Senior Chang before disappearing into the auction house.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yuan and Xiao Hua just stepped into the VIP room, where there were several other individuals.</p><p>\"Kids?\"</p><p>The people there turned their attention to Yuan and Xiao Hua, seemingly curious about their identity.</p><p>\"Who are these kids? I don\'t recognize them.\"</p><p>\"I don\'t know them, either.\"</p><p>\"How could strangers enter this VIP room? They must have a shocking background that we are not aware of.\"</p><p>\"I don\'t mean to brag, but I am familiar with every background that is capable of entering the VIP room, and even I don\'t know them.\"</p><p>It seemed as though nobody in the VIP room recognized Yuan, but that was to be expected, as he does not belong to any background and arrived in this world only recently.</p><p>\"Yuan! I did not expect to see you so soon again!\"</p><p>Suddenly, a pretty young lady approached him.</p><p>\"You are… Xuan Wuhan?\" Yuan also did not expect to see her here, especially when they were together not too long ago.</p><p>\"If I knew that you were coming here, we could\'ve come here together!\" she said.</p><p>\"Hahaha… I did not plan on coming here at first. It\'s only a coincidence.\"</p><p>\"Coincidence or not, we are together again. Come here and sit at my table.\"</p><p>Yuan nodded and followed Xuan Wuhan to her table, where the old man from before and two unfamiliar handsome young men sat.</p><p>\"The Young Lady was right… to enter this room, his background is not so simple after all.\" The old man was surprised to see Yuan in the VIP room.</p><p>\"Who are they?\" One of the young men asked after seeing Xuan Wuhan return with strangers.</p><p>\"Friends I recently made,\" she said.</p><p>\"Hmmm…\"</p><p>The two handsome young men looked at Yuan with a pondering gaze.</p><p>\"Which noble family are you from? I am Du Bai from the Du Family,\" said the handsome young man on the left.</p><p>\"I am Du Hai, his twin brother,\" said the one on the right.</p><p>\"Uh… I am not from any family,\" Yuan casually responded as he sat down beside Xuan Wuhan.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>They all looked at him with a surprised expression.</p><p>\"Then you must be a disciple of a powerful sect. Which sect do you belong to?\"</p><p>\"I am also not a part of any sect. I\'m a Rogue Cultivator,\" he said.</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Once Yuan said those words, the entire room went silent, as everyone in the room was paying attention to him trying to figure out his identity.</p><p>\"A… A Rogue Cultivator, you say? Hahaha… what a good joke…\"</p><p>A few moments later, the entire room burst with laughter.</p><p>\"There\'s no way some Rogue Cultivator would have the privilege to enter this VIP room!\"</p><p>\"Hahaha! He must really want to keep his background hidden!\"</p><p>\"Too bad that only makes me more intrigued!\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>It was Yuan\'s turn to be speechless. He did not understand why they were laughing at him or why they couldn\'t believe his words. But regardless of the reason, since they don\'t believe him, there was nothing he could do. And it\'s not as though he cared whether they believed him or not.</p><p>\"Just ignore them, Yuan.\" Xuan Wuhan said to him.</p><p>And just as she said those words, the lights in the room suddenly dimmed.</p><p>\"The auction is finally starting,\" said Xuan Wuhan as she pointed to the large stage that was right below their VIP room.</p>'),(58,3,'Chapter 23 - Beginning of the Auction',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>\"Hello, esteemed guests! Welcome to the Azure Phoenix Auction House! I will be your main host today, Qing Qing!\"</p><p>A beautiful young lady appeared on the stage with a dazzling smile and a cheerful attitude, brightening the atmosphere despite the dimmed lights.</p><p align=\"center\" class=\"adsbox\" id=\"lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1\"></p><p>\"Before we begin, allow me to remind you of the rules for this auction house! First of all, once you have made a bid on an item, it will be final and you cannot reclaim the offer! Rule number two, you are not allowed to pressure others with your background! This is an auction house, not the streets! After one warning, we will ask you to leave! And lastly, if you bid on an item and cannot afford it in the end, we will take whatever you have on hand until it\'s enough to pay the debt! If the debt is not paid, we will hold you until someone pays the debt!\"</p><p>After announcing the rules, Qing Qing clapped her hands. A moment later, another beautiful lady appeared on the stage while pushing a cart covered by a thick cloth.</p><p>\"Then without further ado, let me reveal the first item for today\'s auction — an Earth-grade medium quality chest plate made of silver metal, allowing it to have nearly no weight while retaining high defenses! As long as this armor is on your body, all damage dealt by those below the Spirit Master realm will be reduced in half!\"</p><p>As Qing Qing announced the item, her assistant removed the cover on the cart and revealed the silver armor under it.</p><p>\"50% damage reduction as long as their Cultivation is below the Spirit Master level? How powerful!\" Yuan gazed at the armor with wide eyes. If he had such equipment, it would greatly increase his survivability in this world!</p><p>Xiao Hua noticed his desire for the armor in Yuan\'s eyes and spoke, \"Brother Yuan, although it may sound powerful, it\'ll only work if your opponent is below the Spirit Master level. With your talent, you\'ll be fighting Spirit Masters in no time! What\'s more, with Xiao Hua here, nobody will be able to hurt you, even if they are a Spirit Grandmaster!\"</p><p>Yuan chuckled at her confident face and nodded.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Du Brothers sitting on the other side of his table were glaring at the silver armor with drooling eyes.</p><p>\"This is a must-have item! As long as we have this, we will be near-invincible within the Inner Court!\"</p><p>They laughed loudly.</p><p>\"Relying on treasures too much will affect your Cultivation, Du Bai, Du Hai.\" Xuan Wuhan reminded them after seeing their excited expressions.</p><p>However, as though they did not hear her, the Du Brothers continued to stare at the armor.</p><p>\"The starting price for the armor will be 100,000 Gold!\" Qing Qing announced.</p><p>\"100,000 Gold!\" Yuan could feel his heart skip a beat after hearing the price, and it was just the starting price. It\'s no wonder why they refused to accept his Monster Cores that would only sell for a measly 100 Gold.</p><p>\"110,000 Gold!\" The Du Brother immediately bid.</p><p>\"115,000 Gold!\"</p><p>\"118,000 Gold!\"</p><p>\"120,000 Gold!</p><p>\"130,000 Gold!\"</p><p>The price went up by thousands with each call, and within minutes, it raised to 280,000 Gold!</p><p>\"280,000 Gold… Even if there are players here, I doubt they\'ll have enough money to buy it…\" Yuan thought to himself.</p><p>\"280,000 Gold going once… going twice… and sold!\"</p><p>\"Yes! We got it!\"</p><p>The Du Brothers hugged each other with joy after winning the bid.</p><p>\"Their family must be filthy rich...\" Yuan thought as he watched them celebrate.</p><p>\"We will keep the item for now. After the auction ends, the winners may retrieve the item after paying the debt,\" said Qing Qing as she called for another assistant to go onto the stage.</p><p>\"The next item will be a Spirit-grade Martial Technique, Fire Lotus Palm Strike! The ability packs devastating power and will also burn everything it touches! The starting price will be 10,000 Gold!\"</p><p>\"A single Spirit-grade skill costs over 10,000 Gold?!\" Yuan was shocked.</p><p>Since all of his skills were either self-taught or taught by Xiao Hua, they were all free. He simply cannot imagine paying for an Earth-grade skill, much less a skill at the Divine-grade.</p><p>\"Ummm… how much would a Divine-grade skill normally cost?\" Yuan decided to ask Xuan Wuhan.</p><p>Xuan Wuhan looked at him with wide eyes. \"Divine-grade? You cannot buy that kind of technique even with all of the money in this world! Hahaha!\" she laughed afterward.</p><p>Yuan\'s jaw dropped to the ground after hearing her words. Cannot be bought with money? To think Xiao Hua would be so generous that she\'d give out something like that for free! He suddenly felt the urge to wrap his arms around her and embrace her tightly!</p><p>A few minutes later, the Fire Lotus Palm Strike was bought by an old man in the VIP Room for 48,000 Gold.</p><p>\"The third item is a Tier 3 pill, Soul Strengthening Pill with 80% purity, crafted by the renowned 3-Star Alchemist, Bai Ming!\"</p><p>\"Xiao Hua, what\'s an Alchemist? Do they turn things into gold?\" Yuan asked her.</p><p>\"Alchemists are medical experts that craft special medicine with their Cultivation, usually in the form of pills. Every pill has a different effect. Some can increase your strength while others can boost your stamina. Pills are usually expensive, so it\'s not an exaggeration to say they make gold...\"</p><p>\"I see…\" Yuan nodded as though he understood something.</p><p>\"Soul Strengthening Pill… it has a mind-calming effect, allowing you to achieve greater results during Cultivation. I want this!\" Xuan Wuhan gripped her hands into a fist.</p><p>\"Senior Bai personally crafted 15 Soul Strengthening Pill for today\'s auction, enough to fill three pill bottles, and we will be selling them separately. For the first bottle that contains 5 Soul Strengthening Pills, the starting price will be 5,000 Gold!\"</p><p>Yuan\'s eyes nearly popped out of its sockets after hearing the price.</p><p>\"Mother of fortune, 1,000 Gold for one tiny pill?! If I want to earn money quickly, it seems like becoming an Alchemist is the only way!\" Yuan\'s interest in alchemy was piqued. He thought that if one day he has a chance to learn alchemy, he would definitely give it a try.</p><p>However, Xiao Hua also noticed this and quickly lowered his expectations of being an Alchemist by saying, \"Although pills can be sold for good money, it\'s also incredibly hard to craft pills, and they usually end in failures unless you are a very skilled Alchemist. Even a single Tier 1 pill will require hours of effort to complete, not to mention that the supplies needed to craft the pill will also cost a lot of money. What\'s more, even geniuses will need to train for years before they can become a proper Alchemist. If Brother Yuan wants to become an Alchemist, you will need a lot of money, talent, and patience.\"</p><p>\"...\" Yuan\'s hype for Alchemists immediately dipped after hearing Xiao Hua\'s \'encouraging\' words.</p><p>\'Life is hard even inside a game, huh…\' he sighed inwardly.</p>'),(59,3,'Chapter 24 - Heaven-grade Treasure',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>\"6,000 Gold!\" Xuan Wuhan immediately bid for the Soul Strengthening Pill once the auction began.</p><p>\"6,100 Gold!\"</p><p align=\"center\" class=\"adsbox\" id=\"lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_1\"></p><p>\"6,200 Gold!\"</p><p>A few minutes later, Xuan Wuhan managed to secure the Soul Strengthening Pill for 7,500 Gold.</p><p>\"Yes! Now I will be able to breakthrough to the third level Spirit Warrior Realm!\" she made a victorious fist.</p><p>However, Xuan Wuhan was not satisfied with just a single bottle, so she proceeded to bid on the other two bottles.</p><p>After a few more minutes, two more bottles of Soul Strengthening Pills were handed to Xuan Wuhan, and she ended up paying 25,000 Gold for all three bottles.</p><p>\"Hey, Yuan.\" Xuan Wuhan suddenly called for him.</p><p>\"What\'s the matter?\" he turned to look at her.</p><p>Xuan Wuhan smiled and opened one of the pill bottles to retrieve a Soul Strengthening Pill.</p><p>\"Here you go. It\'s not much but I hope we can be friends for years to come!\" she said while handing it to him.</p><p>Yuan accepted the pill with slightly widened eyes.</p><p>\"Thank you!\" he said with a smile on his face.</p><p>When Yuan held the Soul Strengthening Pill in his hands, the system automatically analyzed it for him.</p><p>[Soul Strengthening Pill] [Tier 3] [Purity: 82%]</p><p>[Effects: Permanently increases Soul Strength by 1,000]</p><p>[Description: A Spiritual Pill concocted by Bai Ming.]</p><p>[Limit: 3]</p><p>\"It increases my Soul Strength permanently! And by 1,000!\" Yuan exclaimed.</p><p>Xiao Hua then spoke, \"Most pills have a limitation on how many you can consume before it no longer benefits your body. These Soul Strengthening Pills can only be eaten 3 times before it stops benefiting your body. With that being said, even if it won\'t improve your body, it still has other benefits such as calming your mind during Cultivation, hence why she bought so many of them.\"</p><p>\"I see…\" Yuan nodded.</p><p>\"Hey, why don\'t you give us one of those pills too, Lady Xuan. Aren\'t we also friends?\"</p><p>The Du Brothers asked her after seeing her give one to Yuan.</p><p>\"If you wanted some, why didn\'t you even try to buy it?\" Xuan Wuhan asked them.</p><p>\"That\'s because you were very eager to have them, so we didn\'t fight for them with you,\" said Du Hai with a cheeky smile.</p><p>\"Are you saying that I only won because you allowed me to win?\" Xuan Wuhan narrowed her eyes at him.</p><p>Du Hai\'s cheeky smile quickly became an apologetic one and said, \"T-That wasn\'t my intention…\"</p><p>\"Then forget it!\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>After Xuan Wuhan turned her eyes away from him, Du Hai looked at Yuan with narrowed eyes, almost like he blamed Yuan for being responsible for the situation.</p><p>Sometime later, after ten more items were auctioned, Yuan\'s monster cores finally made its appearance.</p><p>\"Umm… for our next item, we have a few monster cores…\" Qing Qing sounded less confident and somewhat embarrassed by her own words.</p><p>\"Monster Cores? Could it belong to a Beast that was at the Spirit Master level?\" The people were slightly surprised by the appearance of monster cores, as they are rarely sold in Auction Houses.</p><p>\"They are Spirit Apprentice level monster cores,\" said Qing Qing with a weird tone.</p><p>\"Spirit Apprentice monster cores? Did the Auction House mess up? How could they sell such trash here?\"</p><p>\"There must\'ve been a mistake. I cannot imagine the Azure Phoenix Auction House purposefully selling trash.\"</p><p>\"The Azure Phoenix Auction House does not make mistakes. Although I don\'t know the reason, these monster cores were approved by Senior Chang herself,\" said Qing Qing, and she continued, \"The starting price for all four of these monster cores will be 500 Spirit Stones.\"</p><p>However, nobody made a bid even after many minutes. It was an unprecedented event for the Azure Phoenix Auction House.</p><p>\"Just take those trash away from our sights! Are you mocking us with them? Nobody wants it!\" Du Bai shouted loudly.</p><p>\"That\'s right! What kind of joke is this? Even if you are the Azure Phoenix Auction House, there is a limit.\"</p><p>Following Du Bai, other guests also began complaining. To sell something worth so little in this high-end Auction House with treasures worth tens of thousands of Gold was akin to selling street meat in a luxurious restaurant. The guests were feeling as though they were being mocked by the auction house.</p><p>\"What should I do…? Senior Chang told me to sell these even if we have to lose face!\" Qing Qing cried inwardly.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the VIP Room, Yuan was slightly trembling from anger. Even though the complaints were directed at the auction house and Qing Qing, he felt as though they were all directed at him, who wanted to sell these monster cores.</p><p>Xuan Wuhan noticed the irritated expression on Yuan\'s face and wondered if the monster cores belonged to him. After all, he gave her one of them at the city\'s entrance.</p><p>\"It\'s just a few hundred golds. If these monster cores really belong to him, it\'ll definitely benefit our relationship, and he might even owe me for giving him face. It might also be another one of his tests...\"</p><p>Thus, Xuan Wuhan spoke the next moment, \"I will bid 600 Gold for these monster cores.\"</p><p>\"Lady Xuan! Why would you bid for the monster cores? They are just trash! Don\'t waste your money on them. If you want, I can give you some at the Spirit Warrior level for free as a gift!\" Du Hai said to her.</p><p>\"Shut up! Do I need your permission if I want to buy something? I just happened to need these monster cores, so I am buying them!\" she coldly snorted.</p><p>\"...\" Yuan looked at her with wide eyes.</p><p>\'Not only did she give me a Soul Strengthening Pill worth hundreds of Gold but she\'s also buying my monster cores… I will definitely thank her properly in the future...\' he thought to himself with a warm smile on his face.</p><p>\"Would you like to pay for the monster cores now?\"</p><p>An assistant from the auction house asked Xuan Wuhan after she easily won the bid due to a lack of competitors.</p><p>Xuan Wuhan retrieved 600 Gold and handed it to the assistant. \"I want it now,\" she said.</p><p>\"Understood.\"</p><p>The assistant accepted the money and returned a few minutes later with the monster cores.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the stage, a new item was already being auctioned.</p><p>\"For the next item, we have this piece of crystal that is of unknown origin. Although we cannot tell you the purpose of its existence, it has a large amount of Qi flowing within like a monster core. In fact, if it was a monster core, it would be comparable to one at the Spirit Grandmaster level.\" Qing Qing showed them the cobble-sized piece of crystal to the guests.</p><p>\"Comparable to a Spirit Grandmaster monster core!\"</p><p>The people were shocked, as monsters at the Spirit Grandmaster level were exceedingly rare and terrifying, and they have the power to wipe out a large city like this Spirit City with ease. In fact, the last time a Spirit Grandmaster monster appeared in this world was 1,000 years ago, killing millions of people and nearly destroying the world if not for the Spirit Grandmasters that sacrificed their own lives to kill it.</p><p>When Xiao Hua saw the cobble-sized crystal, her eyes slightly widened.</p><p>\"Brother Yuan, that\'s a Spirit Crystal.\"</p><p>Xiao Hua\'s voice suddenly resounded in his head.</p><p>\"Spirit Crystal? Like the Ancient Spirit Jade I have?\" he asked.</p><p>\"No, it\'s not real Spirit Jade. Real Spirit Jade, even at the lowest quality, would have more Qi. And even though it\'s not comparable to Spirit Jade, it\'ll still provide a big boost to your Cultivation. It can also be used as a currency in the upper Realms.\"</p><p>\'I wonder how much Qi I would get from consuming it,\' he pondered.</p><p>\"Brother Yuan, you should bid for it.\" Xiao Hua suddenly said.</p><p>\"What? But I don\'t have any money.\"</p><p>\"We may have no money now but we will have plenty once we sell the Heavenly Frost Dagger. It\'ll be more than enough to buy something like this Spirit Crystal, and the people here seem to be unaware of its true value.\"</p><p>Yuan pondered for a moment and asked, \"Are you sure? It\'s still your money.\"</p><p>Even if Xiao Hua allowed him to use the money from selling the Heavenly Frost Dagger, Yuan was not shameless enough to accept it. In fact, if he accepts it despite everything that she\'s already given him, it\'ll make him feel guilty instead.</p><p>\"Buy it, Brother Yuan.\" Xiao Hua nodded with a resolute face.</p><p>\"Okay, if you say so.\"</p><p>\"I must get this piece of crystal that is overflowing with Qi! If I can cultivate the Qi inside, I might even breakthrough and become a Spirit Master in no time!\"</p><p>Xuan Wuhan\'s eyes glittered with excitement.</p><p>\"There\'s no way something that contains so much Qi is not a treasure! It must be a treasure with a powerful ability!\"</p><p>Not just Xuan Wuhan but Du Brothers and the others in the VIP room were also trembling in excitement.</p><p>\"Since we do not know its true value, we will let the guests decide. The auction begins now!\" Qing Qing announced loudly.</p><p>\"10,000 Gold!\"</p><p>\"30,000 Gold!\"</p><p>\"100,000 Gold!\"</p><p>The people immediately began bidding, and the price fluctuated quickly.</p><p>Within mere minutes, the price for the Spirit Crystal reached half a million Gold.</p><p>\"Xiao Hua… it\'s already at 500,000 Gold. Are we still going to buy it?\" Yuan asked her.</p><p>Xiao Hua did not hesitate for a second and nodded.</p><p>\"500,100 Gold!\" Yuan made a bid for the first time in this auction and in his life.</p><p>\"This brat... he\'s not a simple one, as expected…\"</p><p>The people in the VIP room glanced at Yuan with the corner of their eyes.</p><p>\'You want to buy something when I am here? Then you will have to ask me for permission first!\' Du Hai coldly sneered in his heart and raised his hand.</p><p>\"510,000 Gold!\"</p><p>\"510,100 Gold.\" Yuan calmly responded.</p><p>Du Hai gnashed his teeth and spoke loudly, \"Are you purposely trying to provoke me by adding so little every time?!\"</p><p>Yuan raised an eyebrow at Du Hai\'s words, as he truly didn\'t understand why Du Hai would be upset about that. \"Is there something wrong with that?\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Du Hai trembled in anger at Yuan\'s response, thinking that he was being mocked.</p><p>\"520,000 Gold! This is how you bid in an auction! What is the point in adding so little?!\"</p><p>\"520,100 Gold. What if I add too much and waste money? I\'d rather play it safe.\" Yuan innocently shook his head.</p><p>After all, it was not his money that he\'s using to bid.</p><p>Xuan Wuhan chuckled after hearing Yuan\'s words, which only fueled Du Hai\'s rage even further.</p><p align=\"center\" class=\"adsbox\" id=\"lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_2\"></p><p>\"Good! Since you want to play that game, then I will also play!\"</p><p>\"520,200 Gold!\"</p><p>\"520,300 Gold.\"</p><p>\"520,400 Gold!\"</p><p>\"520,500 Gold.\"</p><p>After a few minutes of bidding back and forth, Du Hai was finally unable to endure it and burst with anger, \"You mother fucker! How dare you play with me like this!\"</p><p>Seeing Du Hai lose control of his temper and preparing to strike Yuan, Na Ning, who had been standing in the background in silence stood forward and spoke, \"Esteemed guest, please behave yourself. If you continue any further, we will have to ask you to leave.\"</p><p>\"Du Hai, sit back down!\" Du Bai grabbed Du Hai\'s robes with a frown.</p><p>\"Che!\" Du Hai coldly snorted and returned to his seat. However, his narrowed gaze remained on Yuan even after many moments later.</p><p>\"We cannot afford to offend the Azure Phoenix Sect! And give up on this treasure. Our money won\'t last till the end if you spend so much at once. If you want to deal with him, we can do it after the auction.\" Du Bai whispered in Du Hai\'s ears afterward.</p><p>\"Yuan, the Du Brothers are unforgiving people. They will surely try to cause trouble for you afterward. I will speak to them later.\" Xuan Wuhan whispered in Yuan\'s ears when she noticed their suspicious gazes.</p><p>\"Thank you for the warning. \" Yuan nodded.</p><p>Although he was not afraid of them, he\'d rather not have to deal with them.</p><p>A few minutes later, Yuan won the bid with 550,000 Gold.</p><p>\"Esteemed guest, would you like to pay for the item now, or would you like to pay for it afterward?\" Na Ning asked him with a polite tone and a respectful demeanor.</p><p>\"You can subtract it from that item afterward.\" Xiao Hua said to her.</p><p align=\"center\" class=\"adsbox\" id=\"lightnovelpub_Billboard_Inlist_3\"></p><p>\"I understand.\" Na Ning nodded and walked away.</p><p>Xuan Wuhan raised her eyebrows at Xiao Hua words, and she pondered. \'That item? Did they put something else besides the monster cores up for auction?\'</p><p>After selling the Spirit Crystal, a few more items were sold.</p><p>\"Before we start the auction for the final item we have today, allow me to introduce the owner of this auction house, Senior Chang!\" Qing Qing suddenly said, dumbfounding the people there.</p><p>\"Madam Chang will be making an appearance today? How rare.\"</p><p>The people thought.</p><p>A few moments later, an old lady appeared on the stage with a wooden box in her hands.</p><p>\"Thank you all for coming to my auction house today. Since the last item we have for today is a little bit special, I will be conducting the final auction.\" Senior Chang spoke in a low voice, yet her voice echoed in every corner of the room.</p><p>After saying those words, Senior Chang opened the wooden box and revealed the beautiful dagger resting inside.</p><p>\"T-That aura! It\'s a Heaven-grade treasure!\"</p><p>Without even needing Senior Chang to introduce the Heavenly Frost Dagger, the people there were already able to tell what kind of treasure it was from the profound aura that was shrouding the blue dagger.</p><p>\"It\'s really a Heaven-grade treasure! Hahaha! I have lucked out by coming here today!\"</p><p>\"Even though I won\'t be able to afford it, I am already satisfied to witness something so valuable with my own eyes!\"</p><p>The crowd went into an uproar after the appearance of the Heavenly Frost Dagger, as the last time something this precious appeared in the public was 100 years ago!</p>'),(60,3,'Chapter 25 - End of the Auction',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>\"Elder Jia, we must buy this Heaven-grade treasure at all cost!\" Xuan Wuhuan said to the old man beside her with a serious expression.</p><p>\"I agree with the Young Lady.

Even though we might not win, we cannot simply sit here and do nothing while there is such a treasure before us!\" Du Hai spoke with a regrettable face.</p><p>Although the Du Family has decent wealth, compared to the other esteemed guests in the V.I.P room, their wealth is nothing significant. However, even if there\'s the slightest chance they could buy the Heaven-grade treasure, they will surely try.</p><p>The V.I.P room quickly became chaotic, and everybody there looked at the Heavenly Frost Dagger with lustful eyes.</p><p>Even if they have to use all of their money and replace the food on their dinner table with water for the next ten years, they felt that it would all be worth it if they obtained the treasure.</p><p>Once the anticipation within the auction house was at its maximum, Madam Chang spread her arms and spoke with a wide smile, \"Then without further ado, let the bidding for this peak quality Heavenly Frost Dagger begin at 10 million gold!\"</p><p>Despite the outrageous price, the people at the auction house began bidding like animals.</p><p>\"11 million gold!\"</p><p>\"11.5 million gold!\"</p><p>\"13 million gold!\"</p><p>Within minutes, the minimum price for the Heavenly Frost Dagger increased to 21 million gold.</p><p>\"21 million gold…\" Yuan listened to the biddings with a dazed face, seemingly in disbelief.</p><p>He cannot even begin to imagine what he could do with that much wealth.</p><p>\"25 million gold!\" Xuan Wuhuan suddenly shouted.</p><p>The sudden high bid by Xuan Wuhuan slowed the bidding pace briefly, but after a few moments, it returned to normal.</p><p>When the bidding reached 30 million gold, the pace finally slowed down permanently, as only very few individuals there could afford to bring out so much money.</p><p>\"30.5 million!\"</p><p>Of course, Xuan Wuhan, whose family belonged to the business circle, was one of these rich individuals.</p><p>\"31 million!\"</p><p>\"31.5 million!\"</p><p>After a few more minutes of bidding from the same three people, a new voice suddenly resounded.</p><p>\"40 million gold.\"</p><p>The voice was profoundly calm, causing everybody in the V.I.P room to turn to look at the person who just spoke.</p><p>However, that person had not been in the V.I.P room since the beginning, and the people there wondered when this person arrived.</p><p>\"T-That\'s Qi Jiguang from Heaven and Earth Palace! What\'s he doing in this place?!\" Someone there exclaimed after realizing his identity.</p><p>\"What?! The Heaven and Earth Palace?!\" Although most people there were unfamiliar with the name Qi Jiguang, they all gasped in shock after hearing the name \'Heaven and Earth Palace\'.</p><p>\"That man is at the peak of the Spirit Grandmaster. He\'s considered as a peak expert in the Lower Heavens.\" Xiao Hua mumbled to Yuan, who seemed to be dazed by the profound aura surrounding this Qi Jiguang.</p><p>\"I wonder what it would be like to fight someone as powerful as him…\" Yuan said in a low voice.</p><p>Xiao Hua looked at him with raised eyebrows. \"As expected of a battle junkie. In this entire room, you are probably the only one thinking such a thing, Brother Yuan. But at your current cultivation, you won\'t even last a second against a single finger from him. You\'ll die instantly.\"</p><p>\"Hmm?\"</p><p>When Qi Jiguang noticed the two of them looking at him, he also looked back.</p><p>Although there was nothing out of the ordinary about Yuan, he could sense an invisible yet formidable aura coming from Xiao Hua.</p><p>\'That little girl… I cannot see her cultivation base, but she\'s without a doubt an expert like me.\' Qi Jiguang thought to himself.</p><p>While her presence piqued his interest, he did not want to involve himself with another expert at his level without any good reason, as that might lead to unnecessary confrontation.</p><p>Many moments have passed since Qi Jiguang bid 40 million gold for the Heavenly Frost Dagger without anyone else trying to outbid him.</p><p>\'Damn it! Why did someone like him have to appear here today?!\' Xuan Wuhuan cried inwardly. While she had the ability to continue bidding, she did not want to fight against someone from the Heaven and Earth Palace and accidentally offend him, as that would be devastating for her family and its business.</p><p>\"Since there doesn\'t seem to be any more bidders, the bid for this Heaven-grade treasure shall come to an end! Congratulations to the esteemed guest for winning this exquisite treasure!\" Madam Chang clapped with smiles all over her face, as she just earned 4 million gold from this transaction alone.</p><p>After the auction ended, Xuan Wuhan said to Yuan, \"If you ever need anything, come find me at Spring City. You can show anyone the medallion I gave you, and they will lead you to me. I hope to see you again later, Yuan.\"</p><p>The Du Brothers glanced at Yuan with narrowed eyes for a moment before leaving the place.</p><p>Sometime later, Na Ying approached them after the auction ended and said, \"Esteemed Guests, please follow me to claim your sales.\"</p><p>Yuan nodded and proceeded to follow her to a private room at the top of the auction house.</p><p>\"Madam Chang will be here in a few moments with your earnings, please relax in the meantime.\" Na Ying said to them as she poured them a cup of spiritual tea.</p><p>«You have gained the following effect from consuming Phoenix Blossom Tea»</p><p>«Increased Qi Absorption Rate by 10% for 12 hours»</p><p>«Soul Strength +500 permamently»</p><p>Yuan gained some stats after drinking the tea.</p>'),(61,4,'Chapter 1 Su Yang',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 1 Su Yang</h3><p></p><p>                          Two figures sat on the highest point of the Eternal Retribution Cliff, one old man and the other a handsome young man with otherworldly features. The old man emitted an ancient aura that caused the surrounding space to twist and turn, and the young man casually sat beside him, looking as though the heavy atmosphere did not bother him at all.</p><p>\"Young man, what crimes have you committed to get yourself stuck in this gloomy place? You do not look like someone who belongs here…\" The old man asked the young man, his gaze filled with interest as he looked at the young man, who was surrounded by a noble aura that calmed the space surrounding him.</p><p>The young man showed a slight smile. \"I have done many things, one such as devouring the forbidden fruit created by the His Majesty, the Heavenly Emperor,\" he said in a calm voice.</p><p>The old man lifted his brows in surprise, and his gaze flickered with shock as he looked at the young man.</p><p>\"You… you… you…\" Unsure of what to say, the old man stuttered nonstop. To be shocked speechless, this was a first even for someone as ancient as him, not to mention his wide eyes that hadn\'t been this wide for countless years.</p><p>\"I\'m more surprised that you are still alive after all that than what you\'ve done!\"</p><p>The young man only smiled at his words.</p><p>Suddenly, the old man burst out laughing: \"I can already imagine the raging face of the Heavenly Emperor when he first heard the news! Ahahaha! Young man, I have taken a liking to you! What is your name?\"</p><p>The ancient aura surrounding the old man had long disappeared. He looked and acted more like a kind grandpa than anything now.</p><p>\"The name\'s Su Yang,\" said the young man.</p><p>\"Then Su Yang… would you like to leave this place?\" The old man suddenly grinned, showing his two rows of yellow teeth.</p><p>Su Yang turned to look at the old man\'s face for the first time; it was filled with wrinkles, almost like a dried up fruit. However, despite his ghost-like face, his eyes were as clear as water, and they shone brighter than the brightest stars in this eternal night sky.</p><p>\"What\'s the point?\" Su Yang said a moment later: \"Even if I can leave this place, it will only trigger the Heavenly Emperor\'s anger even further. I think I prefer sitting here until my soul rots away than having to constantly deal with the Heavenly Emperor\'s wrath.\"</p><p>\"What if I say that you can leave and not have to worry about the Heavenly Emperor?\" The old man kept the grin on his face, but deep in his gaze flickered a profound light.</p><p>\"Then what? What should I do after leaving? Continue living the sinful life that I have been living for the past thousands of years? Or take revenge on those who wrongly accused me?\"</p><p>\"That… is up to you.\"</p><p>Su Yang suddenly reached his hands towards the night sky and made a grasping motion, almost as if he wished to grab ahold of the stars shining above. \"Then… if I one day decide to leave this place, I will…\" He suddenly stopped talking and smiled: \"Forget it. I think I\'d still rather be lazy in this place until I die.\"</p><p>The old man suddenly started laughing again: \"You are still too young to completely hide your desire from this ancient one, young one! Even if you stay here for all eternity, can you really die from old age? An immortal such as yourself? Hehehe… your wish… I shall grant it!\" He suddenly stood up and waved his sleeves, and the night sky that hadn\'t changed since the creation of this Eternal Retribution Cliff suddenly turned to day, bewildering every soul that dwelled there.</p><p>\"You… who are you?\" Su Yang stared at the grinning old man with wide eyes.</p><p>The old man said: \"Just an old man with nothing better to do. Right… before I send you away, I\'d like to thank you for what you did…\"</p><p>\"Thank me…? What do you mean by tha–\"</p><p>Before Su Yang could ask the old man why he was being thanked, a bright white light suddenly engulfed the world, taking away his vision.</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>Immediately after getting blinded by the white light, Su Yang felt a sharp pain near his heart, like he had just been stabbed by a sword. He snapped his eyes wide open to see a handsome young man with a vicious grin on his face, standing in front of him on a wide stage, and in his grasp was a steel sword.</p><p>\"Che. I narrowly missed his heart,\" mumbled the handsome young man.</p><p>Su Yang looked down to see a sword penetrating his body, and he instantly became alert. \"Scram!\" Within Su Yang\'s body suddenly exploded an overwhelming aura filled with killing intent, causing the handsome young man before him and the dozens of people surrounding their stage to cough up a mouthful of blood.</p><p>And because the handsome young man was standing so close to Su Yang, he directly fell unconscious after coughing up blood.</p><p>The place instantly turned dead silent, and Su Yang pulled out the sword that was still stuck in his chest, ignoring the pain.</p><p>After taking the sword out of his chest, Su Yang took this moment to quickly search through his memories.</p><p>In his memories, he found out that he was inside the body of a young cultivator with the same name as his – Su Yang, and that he has the exact same looks as his younger self. However, the similarities stopped there and everything else was different. His cultivation base was near non-existent when compared to his old cultivation base, and he is currently a disciple in this Profound Blossom Sect – a sect that heavily focuses on dual cultivation – where two people of the opposite gender indulge in sexual practices for cultivation!

Scram before I call for the disciplinary squad!\"</p><p>\"Yes, Elder Sun!\" The disciples around the stage hurriedly scrambled away, leaving only Su Yang and Yan Ming on the stage.</p><p>Su Yang decided to leave this place first and ponder later.

Many female disciples, even the senior disciples, fought to be his partner at first, but when they found out that he had severe mental issues with zero talents, they quickly ignored him.</p><p>No matter how handsome he was, in this sect where their growth depended on their partners, nobody was stupid enough to risk their future just because he was handsome, not to mention the countless other handsome young men and women in this sect.</p><p>\"I have been gifted another life by that old man, but this kind of life… Aiya!\" Su Yang loudly sighed.</p><p>To think he, the most handsome man in the world in his past life, where countless peerless goddess and jade-like fairies would stand in line just to be his partner, would be suffering to find a single partner in this sect with thousands of young maidens.</p><p>\"If I am still in the same world, then there is a chance that they might still be living in this world…\" Su Yang\'s gaze flickered with a profound light as many peerless figures appeared in his mind: \"I will find them and have them in my embrace once again, and I will not let them go this time!

He had it all, beautiful women and power, something that was to be envious of. Now, however, he cannot even hold a candle against a mere mortal at the Elementary Spirit Realm, not to mention the heavy injury.</p><p>Of course, it was the previous \'Su Yang\' who had gotten into that situation, not the current Su Yang. However, Su Yang didn\'t use that as an excuse since he was in the same body, so he blamed it on himself.</p><p>After cleaning the blood off his body, he smeared some medicine over the hole in his chest before wrapping some cloth around the injury and calling it a day.</p><p>By the time Su Yang was done with treating his injury, the news of him beating Yan Ming on the stage in a deathmatch had already spread around the outer court like wildfire.</p><p>\"What? That good-for-nothing Su Yang who can\'t even use his thing down there properly defeated Yan Ming? Are you sure?\"</p><p>\"I saw it with my very two eyes!

What bull! I do not believe it.\"</p><p>\"Aiii… I do not blame you… Even I had a hard time believing my eyes at the time…\"</p><p>Such conversations were going on throughout the sect, and even Elder Sun who had stopped the fight could not help but recall the frightening pressure that suddenly enveloped the place.</p><p>\"What happened between the two of you during the fight? Tell me everything!\"</p><p>Elder Sun glared at Yan Ming who he had taken in for questioning.</p><p>\"I… I don\'t know…\" Yan Ming said with a huge headache: \"All I can remember is stabbing that Su Yang in the chest before a sudden wave of killing intent overwhelmed me… Before stabbing him, it was like fighting an idiot who didn\'t even know how to swing a sword properly… After that, however…\"</p><p>Yan Ming shivered when he recalled the expression on Su Yang\'s face after stabbing him.</p><p>\"It was almost as if I was looking at another person after he received my sword!\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Elder Sun pondered the words Yan Ming spoke.</p><p>\"The killing intent I felt coming from that boy was not something that could be created after getting stabbed once but something that can only be created with many near-death experiences and after killing many people… Who is that Su Yang, really? And how come I have never heard of him until today?\"</p><p>Elder Sun looked at Yan Ming and said: \"You can leave now. Do not let me catch you on the stage without permission again!\"</p><p>\"This disciple would not dare!\"</p><p>After Yan Ming left the scene, Elder Sun began looking up information of Su Yang. But after just a few minutes of research, he was dumbstruck by the information he has received.</p><p>From what he had gathered, Su Yang has been in this sect for nearly an entire year, yet there has been no progression with his cultivation since he joined because he was unsuccessful in finding a partner. Elder Sun couldn\'t believe how such a handsome man such as Su Yang would be unable to find a partner, so he dug a little bit deeper.</p><p>What he found shocked him numb. To the point where he didn\'t know what to feel.</p><p>\"Mental issues? Don\'t know how to use his thing down there properly? No talent? Are you sure about this?\"</p><p>Elder Sun asked the person who was providing him the information, who happened to be another sect elder.</p><p>\"You may not know about him since you rarely pay attention to the outer court, but almost everybody within the outer court knows Su Yang and his condition. The only reason he is still able to stay in this sect as a disciple is because the Patriarch believes that he could still be of some use for the sect with his handsome face.\"</p><p>\"Aiii! If he at least had a straight mind, then he would still have a chance in this world…\"</p><p>Elder Sun sighed at the elder\'s words. Indeed, it was true that Su Yang had an incredibly handsome face even with the sect\'s high standards. But with the way he is... what waste of a handsome face.</p><p>\"However…\"</p><p>Elder Sun suddenly narrowed his eyes: \"He looked nothing like what you just told me when I saw him today.\"</p><p>\"I don\'t know what else to tell you, Elder Sun.

Does she have a partner, yet?\"</p><p>Elder Mu suddenly brought up his granddaughter who had recently joined the sect.</p><p>When Elder Mu mentioned his granddaughter, the seriousness on Elder Sun disappeared, and he laughed: \"That girl is very picky; it\'ll be a long while before she finds somebody.\"</p><p>\"Then, how about letting her meet my grandson, Mu Gong, one of these days?\"</p><p>Elder Sun\'s lips twitched at Elder Mu\'s suggestion, but he kept his smile and said casually: \"One of these days.\"</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>When he finally decided to leave his room, Su Yang was greeted by Tang Hu and another figure – a beautiful young lady.

Being roommates for nearly a year, he was able to feel that there was something different about the current Su Yang. The most obvious part was that he longer has that idiotic expression on his face and now looked more normal.</p><p>\"Hm? Where are you going now?\"</p><p>\"Just a stroll around the place,\" said Su Yang who was already at the door, ready to leave.</p><p>\"But your injury…\"</p><p>\"Like I said – just a bug bite.\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>After Su Yang left the place, Meng Jia said: \"He looks different today…\"</p><p>\"You think so, too?

No matter how handsome he gets, you will be my only partner!\"</p><p>\"That\'s not it…\" Tang Hu said with a blush.</p><p>\"Alright!

With Premium Points, one can exchange it for anything within the White Pearl Treasury.</p><p>Premium Points can be obtained through the sect by doing meritorious deeds for the sect, or by doing missions; they can also be traded with others like a real currency.</p><p>\"How much Premium Points for this Pure Yang Flower?\"</p><p>Su Yang asked the elder behind the desk. He had decided to come to the White Pearl Treasury after realizing that he is currently too weak. But without a partner to cultivate with, the only way he\'d be able to cultivate would be with resources obtained from the sect. And what better way to get resources than from the White Pearl Treasury, where all types of valuable resources could be found and purchased?</p><p>\"Pure Yang Flower? Why does an Outer Court disciple like yourself want with such a valuable medicine?\" The old man looked at him with an intrigued expression: \"10,000.\"</p><p>\"10,000?\" Yuan lifted his eyebrows with surprise: \"The most Premium Points someone can obtain in a mission should be 100, and those are the highest difficulties, yet you want 10,000 Premium Points for a mere Pure Yang Flower? This is robbery in plain daylight!\"</p><p>In his eyes, the Pure Yang Flower is only a low-quality medicine used by mortals, yet they treat it as though it is some sort of godly medicine.</p><p>\"The patriarch himself priced it; if you have any complaints, then you can go to him. Otherwise, the price is final.\"</p><p>Su Yang glanced at the jade slip in his grasp and sighed. \"Aiiii… 34 Premium Points… after spending one year in this place…\"</p><p>He looked around, and many beauties came into his view. \"I could just get a partner… but no matter how I look at it… they are all just brats that are still wet behind their ears…\"</p><p>While Su Yang is currently inside the body of a 16-year-old young man, his mental age is anything but young. He just couldn\'t get himself to stick his rod into kids that are not even half his actual age. And while one\'s age does not matter when it comes to cultivators that can live thousands of years and remain looking young, it just didn\'t feel right to Su Yang.</p><p>\"So, do you want it or not?\" The elder behind the desk said in an impatient tone despite already knowing the answer. He could guess that Su Yang did not have enough Premium Points just by his status as a mere Outer Court disciple. Forget about an Outer Court disciple such as him, even an Inner Court disciple would have a hard time obtaining 10,000 Premium Points.</p><p>\"I want it.\" Su Yang\'s answer dumbfounded the elder: \"But not right now. In ten days, I will return with enough Premium Points to exchange for it.\"</p><p>\"You… how will you manage that?\" The elder asked with his eyes wide open.</p><p>Su Yang only smiled at the elder\'s question and walked away without answering, which caused a few veins to appear on the elder\'s forehead.</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>After leaving the White Pearl Treasury, Su Yang went to find a large piece of cloth and something to write on it.

If you refuse to any of these conditions, then you may turn around and walk away. If you fail to fulfill the second and third condition after the massage, then you can forget about coming back ever again.\"</p><p>\"That… that\'s it?\" The young lady thought Su Yang had something far more serious in mind, but such easy conditions… who wouldn\'t accept?</p><p>\"Pft… one month… It\'d be a miracle if you have another customer after her today…\" The disciples laughed.</p><p>\"Do you accept?\"</p><p>\"I accept.\"</p><p>\"Good.

By the third month, the poison would have spread throughout their entire body, giving them a slow and painful death that could last up to 7 days.\"</p><p>Su Yang\'s explanation caused the little girl to tremble in horror, her robes soaked in cold sweat.

It was at this moment the needle between Su Yang\'s fingers flickered.</p><p>A tiny hole that could not be seen with just the bare eyes opened up in Qi Yue\'s left thigh, and some sort of white smoke began escaping through that hole, creating a small cloud of mist above her legs.</p><p>The moment the mist appeared, Su Yang moved his lips towards the hole on her thighs without hesitation and began sucking.</p><p>\"Ah! Wha–?!\"</p><p>The unexpected sucking sensation on her thighs caused Qi Yue to snap open her eyes. When she saw Su Yang\'s lips on her thigh, her face exploded with redness, nearly losing conscious from shock.</p><p>However, despite his shameless and seemingly vulgar actions, Qi Yue did not kick him away and allowed him to continue. Her breathing quickened, and her eyes flickered with desire... lust.</p><p>Meanwhile, Su Yang was fully focused on extracting the poison through the tiny hole in her thigh. His robes were soaked in sweat, and his body burned from the poison he absorbed. Every part of his body was screaming in pain, and because of his low cultivation base, it only made it harder for him to subdue the poison within his body. Even if he wished, he simply wasn\'t in a position to enjoy the soft sensation on his lips.</p><p>At this moment, the only thing that could be heard in this small and quiet room was Qi Yue\'s heavy breathing and low moans. A few minutes felt like a few hours for the two, one embraced by pleasure and one enduring pain.</p><p>When only a few seconds of the ten minutes were left, Su Yang finally released his lips.</p><p>Su Yang coughed up a mouthful of black blood the moment his lips separated from Qi Yue\'s soft skin, his complexion turning ashen right after.</p><p>Su Yang wiped the black blood from the corner of his lips and smiled: \"It\'s been a long time since I last sweated like this during a treatment…\"</p><p>Su Yang collapsed on the bed beside Qi Yue right after his sentence, his conscious barely awake.</p><p>\"A-A-Are you okay!?\" Qi Yue cried out loud in alarm.</p><p>\"Luckily, the poison had yet to spread to other areas and only occupied your left leg, so I was able to extract it without any problem. But being only at the third level of Elementary Spirit Realm, the process had drained my very limited Profound Qi quickly. I am only tired from exhausting my Profound Qi… let me sleep for a bit and I will be fine… Don\'t forget… the conditions...\"</p><p>Su Yang fell asleep after those words, dumbfounding Qi Yue. She didn\'t know what to do, but since he said that he would be fine, she felt relieved.</p><p>After taking a moment to organize herself, Qi Yue helped Su Yang by adjusting his awkward sleeping position and covered him with a blanket before quietly leaving.</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>It was already the next morning by the time Su Yang woke up. He sat up and looked at the blanket covering him. \"How caring of her,\" he smiled.</p><p>Although he had expected that it would be somewhat troublesome to heal Qi Yue, he did not expect that it would have been that challenging with his low cultivation base.</p><p>\"I really need to increase my cultivation base… but before I obtain that Pure Spirit Yang and cleanse the impurities within my body, I need to get used to this body and its insignificant cultivation base.\"</p><p>Su Yang left the bed to take a quick shower. Afterward, he sat back on his bed in the lotus position.</p><p>Deep within his mind, countless cultivation techniques he had learned from his previous life appeared one by one. Su Yang wasn\'t just a playboy in his previous life. He was also a cultivator and a doctor, so he has many resources at his disposal.</p><p>\"Celestial Body Refining Scripture… one of the seven Heavenly Sublime Scripture obtained from the Heavenly Emperor\'s treasury…\"</p><p>In his previous life, Su Yang wasn\'t able to cultivate this Celestial Body Refining Scripture because he had obtained it too late and had already refined his body.</p><p>\"Not only did I steal his daughter\'s body and heart, but I also obtained his favorite cultivation technique. If the Heavenly Emperor is still alive… I should avoid him at all cost…\"</p><p>He closed his eyes, and he began reciting the Celestial Body Refining Scripture within his head.</p><p>\"Consume the Universe, refine the body, achieve an immortal physique – the Celestial Body!\"</p><p>The Celestial Body Refining Scripture was a technique that cultivated one\'s body – their physique – and one\'s cultivation. In order to achieve the Celestial Body, he must consume things with Profound Qi and refine it as his own, tempering his cultivation base and body simultaneously.</p><p>There were two primary paths of training to become an Immortal.</p><p>The first was in Qi Refining, refining Profound Qi. The majority of those who trained to become an Immortal chose this path. This path allowed one to use many powerful techniques, control gravity, soar in the sky, and even change the weather. In other words, it was a profound and glamorous path.</p><p>The other path was in Body Refining, refining one\'s physical body. It is said that Body Refining is at least a few dozen times more difficult than Qi Refining, where one has to endure unimaginable pain and torture their own body until it breaks for little result. However, enduring such a torture would allow them to move mountains with bare hands, change terrains, even poke holes in stars with mere fingers.</p><p>Ordinarily, one would choose either Qi Refining or Body Refining, never both due to the unimaginable amount of time it would consume to train in both. The Celestial Body Refining Scripture, however, allowed one to cultivate in both Qi Refining and Body Refining sententiously – a heaven-defying technique!</p><p>Suddenly, Su Yang\'s body began turning red, looking as though he was being roasted in a fire. His body temperature reached nearly 150 celsius within minutes, and a burning smell began emitting from underneath him; he was burning the bed with his body temperature alone.</p><p>Su Yang was using the Three Seasons Snake\'s poison he had contained within his body to temper his body, something he had decided to do after seeing Qi Yue.</p><p>Even if he does not have a partner for dual cultivations, there are many other ways to cultivate. While it is not as pleasurable as dual cultivation where he can enjoy the embrace of another, this method of cultivation is still exercised upon by the majority of the world and is even more beneficial than dual cultivation in most scenarios.</p><p>After half an hour, a refreshing feeling suddenly exploded inside Su Yang\'s body, cooling his burning body. He had a breakthrough, reaching the fourth level of Elementary Spirit Realm in cultivation and the early stage of Elementary Spirit Body Refiner simultaneously.  						<br/></p>'),(68,4,'Chapter 8 This Is Why You Are Still Single',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 8 This Is Why You Are Still Single</h3><p></p><p>                          Immediately after washing himself, Su Yang traveled back to the training grounds where many disciples had started their training long ago.</p><p>\"That Su Yang is back. He\'s really persistent with this scheme of his…\"</p><p>\"What happened with those two who dared to follow him? Have they reported him yet?\"</p><p>\"Eh? Haven\'t you heard? Not only were those two extremely satisfied, but they are also helping him by spreading high praises of his services.\"</p><p>\"What!?

Thanks to senior apprentice-brother Su and his wonderful treatment, the pain did not appear last night, and I was able to sleep peacefully for the first time in a long time.\"</p><p>\"That\'s good to hear.\" Su Yang showed her a gentle smile filled with care, causing Qi Yue to blush.</p><p>\"Hehehe…\" The image of Su Yang sucking her thighs yesterday abruptly appeared in Qi Yue\'s mind. Even the sensation of his lips could be recalled very clearly, almost like it was engraved deeply within her heart.</p><p>\"You are the one who treated her yesterday?\" The beautiful woman who looked to be in her twenties asked the moment she arrived in front of them.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>The beautiful woman, who was addressed as Elder Lan by the disciples, frowned at his calm demeanor. \"Su Yang, 16 years old. You have been in the sect for nearly an entire year as an Outer Court disciple, yet you still have no partner. Not to mention all the rumors about you being a retard and a good-for-nothing… How did you do it? This brat wouldn\'t tell me how you treated her no matter how much I asked.\"</p><p>Su Yang glanced at Qi Yue, who became flustered after hearing Elder Lan\'s question, and smiled: \"I apologize in advance, but that is privacy between my customer and me; I am not allowed to share such information with strangers.\"</p><p>\"What did you just say?\" Elder Lan\'s facial expression darkened: \"Do I need to remind you who you are speaking to? I am Elder Lan, the Head Elder of the Health Department for the Outer Court. All the injured or sick disciples within the Outer Court are under my administration, meaning that she is also under my care!\"</p><p>\"...And?\" Su Yang\'s calm demeanor remained the same despite her threatening gaze that seemed to want to swallow him whole, and he continued: \"What does that have anything to do with me?\"</p><p>\"Y-You… an arrogant brat who doesn\'t know how to respect his seniors!\"</p><p>\"Sister Lan! Stop!\" Qi Yue\'s startled cry halted Elder Lan\'s movement, who was seconds away from slapping Su Yang in the face without restraint.</p><p>\"...\" Elder Lan suppressed the anger in her stomach and took a deep breath. \"Qi Yue, are you sure that a stinking brat like him had healed your leg when even a seasoned doctor such as myself... couldn\'t tell what was wrong with you?\"</p><p>Su Yang chucked when Elder Lan addressed herself as a \'seasoned doctor\', which caused her glare at him. She had a feeling that he was laughing at her.</p><p>\"Sister Lan, we didn\'t come here today to offend senior apprentice-brother Su! We came here for his help.\" Qi Yue said to her in a worried tone, sounding like an elder sister.</p><p>Elder Lan snorted coldly: \"What can a brat who isn\'t even half my age like him do? There is nothing an arrogant brat like him can do to help me!\"</p><p>\"You are absolutely right. There is nothing I can do to help you relieve the sharp pain in your buttocks when sitting down. Go find someone else who is more experienced, someone at least twice your age…\"</p><p>Elder Lan\'s eyebrows twitched uncontrollably at Su Yang\'s sarcastic words.</p><p>\"See? Senior apprentice-brother Su is the real deal! He was able to tell that you are hurt with a single glance! You have to allow him to help you!\"</p><p>Qi Yue\'s innocent words were like sharp swords stabbing Elder Lan\'s heart. Although she didn\'t want to admit it, Su Yang\'s insight definitely surprised her in more than one way.</p><p>\"Even if she believes in you, I will never trust you! Let\'s go, Qi Yue.\" Elder Lan turned around and dragged Qi Yue away with her.</p><p>The disciples there wondered what their relationship was. They looked like sisters, but everybody there was well aware that Elder Lan has no siblings.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>\"Sister Lan! You have been in great pain for the past few days because of your injury, even missing out on your daily cultivation. If this goes on…\"</p><p>\"Don\'t worry about me, Qi Yue. I will find a way to treat myself without the help of that Su Yang. He is only an Outer Court disciples whilst I am a sect elder, after all. I will lose all face if I lower myself and ask him for help.\"</p><p>\"...\" Qi Yue sighed at her stubbornness. She has known Elder Lan since she was a baby because their families had connections with each other. Although they are not real sisters, they treat each other as though they are siblings.</p><p>\"Sister Lan… this is why you are still single… you are too prideful, and you are already 40 years old… At this rate, you will die as a single woman.\"</p><p>Qi Yue\'s words nearly caused Elder Lan to cough up a mouthful of blood. \"You little brat! You are still too young to have a partner, let alone talk about mine! I\'ll have you address me as Elder Lan for the rest of the week!\"</p><p>\"Ehhh?! But...\"</p><p>\"No buts! I am Elder Lan to you for the rest of the week.\"</p><p>Qi Yue sighed. She turned her head to look at Su Yang, who was still standing there quietly and calmly. \"Senior apprentice-brother Su…\" her face reddened at the sight of his face.  						<br/></p>'),(69,4,'Chapter 9 Wetting the Bed',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 9 Wetting the Bed</h3><p></p><p>                          Su Yang stood inside the training ground until the sun had set without receiving a single customer, yet he refused to leave and continued to stand there like a stone statue.</p><p>The disciples there were surprised to see such a patient character, and those who weren\'t aware of his identity were charmed by his noble presence. It felt as though they were being protected by a guardian spirit.</p><p>Time passed quickly, and soon, the night sky appeared. Yet, there still hasn\'t been a single customer that approached him.</p><p>However, despite getting zero customers after an entire day, Su Yang didn\'t panic, nor was he worried. Instead, he kept his confidence and remained his calm face, from morning to night. Such patience caused many to secretly admire him, wishing that they could have the same thing when it came to training themselves.</p><p>After some time, Su Yang finally moved. He tilted his head and looked at the night sky, but all he saw inside his head was an image of Elder Lan\'s round buttocks.</p><p>\"Two… no, one day at most, huh.\" Su Yang mumbled. He then began rolling up the sign and prepared to go back home for the day.</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>After sending Qi Yue back to her living quarters, Elder Lan directly went back to her own. Inside, she laid on her bed with her back facing the ceiling. Since she cannot sit because of the abnormal pain in her buttocks, her cultivation came to a halt since a few days ago.</p><p>\"This really sucks…\" she sighed underneath her pillow.</p><p>The pain had started last weak without any notice and has been increasing at a fast rate since then. Unable to sit without crying, she could only stand or lay on the bed.</p><p>\"At this rate, I wouldn\'t be able to walk without bearing any pain… I need to get this treated as soon as possible...\"</p><p>Suddenly, the image of Su Yang and his handsome face appeared in her head, and that made her feel irritated. \"Why did that rude brat come into mind?\" She wanted to ignore him, but the fact that Qi Yue\'s leg had been treated by him wouldn\'t change no matter what.</p><p>\"How did he do it? I wasn\'t even able to see the problem with my 10 years of experience, yet he healed her in a single night, and seemingly flawlessly, too.\"</p><p>\"Ahhh! That little brat Qi Yue! Why won\'t she tell me anything? Am I not trustworthy in her eyes?\"</p><p>The more she thought about the situation between Su Yang and Qi Yue the angrier she got. Suddenly, in the midst of her thoughts, an excruciating sharp pain that caused her to cry out loud attacked her buttocks. The pain was akin to having a sharp sword stab her in the rear over and over again, nearly causing her to lose consciousness.</p><p>In her forty years of life, she has never experienced anything near as painful as currently.</p><p>Furthermore, the pain did not cease and only continued to grow stronger. And within minutes, she lost consciousness, her body soaked in sweat.</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>When she woke up, it was already morning, and her robes were still wet. The bed sheets were also soaking wet, but it wasn\'t her sweating that had soaked them but something else entirely different.</p><p>\"I… I…\" The thought of her wetting the bed as a forty-year-old grown woman caused her head to explode in redness. Luckily, she lived alone by herself. If someone had seen her wet the bed at her age, then she would surely lose all face and her desire to live.</p><p>It was at this point after she had wet the bed that she realized the help she needed. If this continued, then who knows what might happen tomorrow, let alone a week from now. Just thinking about it caused her to tremble violently.</p><p>\"But where do I get help? Who can help me?\" Elder Lan pondered but to no avail. She could be considered one of the best doctor within the sect, yet she couldn\'t even heal herself.</p><p>Suddenly, an image of Qi Yue smiling appeared in her head, and standing casually beside her was a handsome young man with a calm expression – one that made others feel confident when in his presence.</p><p>\"Su Yang!\" Elder Lan quickly cleaned herself before rushing towards the training ground. When she arrived, however, neither Su Yang or his poorly made sign was anywhere to be seen.</p><p>She then went to Qi Yue\'s living quarters.</p><p>\"Qi Yue! Wake up!\" Elder Lan directly opened the door to Qi Yue\'s living quarters with a spare key that had been given to her by Qi Yue for emergencies.</p><p>\"Mmmm…? Sister Lan…?\" Qi Yue rubbed her eyes tiredly, puzzled as to why Elder Lan would be there.</p><p>\"Su Yang! Where does he live? I need to see him right this moment!\"</p><p>\"Eh? Senior apprentice-brother Su?\" Qi Yue has never seen her Sister Lan so panicked before, so she also began panicking. \"What did senior apprentice-brother Su do? Is he in trouble?\"</p><p>\"No… I… I need to see whether or not he can… can treat my injury…\" Elder Lan forcefully squeezed the reason she needed to see him out of her mouth through her embarrassment.</p><p>Qi Yue looked at her dumbfoundedly for a moment, and her eyes suddenly began sparkling. \"Sister Lan requires senior apprentice-brother Su\'s treatment, right? I\'ll bring you to his living quarters right away!\" Qi Yue said in a happy-sounding voice as she jumped off the bed.</p><p>\"Un…\" Elder Lan nodded, yet there was still a shred of doubt in her heart.</p><p>Could a mere Outer Court disciple like Su Yang really treat her injury? She was still hesitant, but the urgency in her heart overwhelmed her uncertainty. She wouldn\'t be able to endure pain she felt last night or waking up to herself wetting the bed for a second time, after all.  						<br/></p>'),(70,4,'Chapter 10 Beauty Waiting by the Door',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 10 Beauty Waiting by the Door</h3><p></p><p>                          Elder Lan banged on the doors to Su Yang\'s living quarters, but the person who came out to greet them a moment later was Tang Hu, Su Yang\'s roommate.</p><p>\"Elder Lan!?\" He looked more terrified than surprised to see a sect elder banging at his door.

The one who usually stands there like an idiot?\" Elder Lan asked the disciples training there, but all of them shook their heads.</p><p>\"Where is that kid? Qi Yue, go ask around and see if anyone has seen Su Yang. If you cannot find him within the hour, come back here and meet with me. If you find him, then bring him here. If I do not come back after an hour, then I should have already found him.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\"</p><p>Elder Lan then looked at the disciples there and said: \"If any of you see disciple Su Yang, tell him that Elder Lan is looking for him! If you can find him for me, then I will award you with 100 Premium Points!\"</p><p>\"One hundred Premium Points?! That\'s as much as a high-risk mission would award!\"</p><p>The disciples there became excited from the mission given to them by Elder Lan. Someone as handsome as Su Yang must be an easy sighting, right? And the fact that almost all Outer Court disciple knows his face only makes this mission easier.</p><p>The disciples scrambled out of the training grounds as though there was an ongoing fire. And for the first time since the sect\'s opening, the training ground looked deserted.</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>Somewhere in the Outer Court, Su Yang was casually flipping through pages for a book. Sitting beside him are books and scrolls that piled all the way above his head. He was in the library, where hundreds of records and even cultivation techniques were gathered.</p><p>This library, the Profound Library, is a place that rents out its resources to its disciples and elders alike. Whether it\'d be an ancient record about myths and legends or a scroll containing a profound cultivation technique, they have it all.</p><p>Su Yang was trying to learn more about this world – this world that he was mysteriously thrown into. However, in this mortal world, there was little to no information on the places he knew.</p><p>The Moon God\'s Palace, the Heavenly Temple, even the Land of Gods that everybody and their mother in his previous life knew are unknown in this world or remain as mere legends and myths.</p><p>\"Am I really in the same world, or was I reincarnated into a foreign world? One that I have no knowledge of?\" Su Yang placed the book down and sighed, his gaze filled with doubt. \"But there are also many things here that I am familiar with, such as the Pure Yang Flower. Even the cultivation stages here are the same...\"</p><p>In his previous life, Su Yang traveled not just his own world, but all four worlds that shared the same universe. If he was thrown into any of these four worlds, he should know right away, yet he doesn\'t have the slightest clue as to where he is currently.</p><p>\"This is clearly the mortal world, but what is this Eastern Continent? How long has it been since I left the Eternal Retribution Cliff?\" Countless questions that have no answers appeared in his mind.</p><p>After glancing through a few more scrolls, Su Yang came to a conclusion. If he does not leave this sect and learn more about this world, then he will surely never see those he loves again.</p><p>However, it was still early for him to leave. Mainly because he is currently too weak. With his cultivation base, he can forget about surviving the wilderness, let alone find his lovers that are scattered across the starry sky.</p><p>At his current stage, any expert within the cultivation world could easily crush him with a single finger, so he could only stay holed up in this sect until he has a sufficient cultivation base that would allow him to travel without too much danger.</p><p>Su Yang took a deep breath, and he looked at the beauties that walked in and out of the library. \"The moment I obtain the Pure Yang Flower, that is when I will truly begin cultivating!\" His gaze flickered with a profound light.</p><p>Su Yang stayed in the corner of the library until the sunset arrived, and he finally decided to leave. After tidying up the place, Su Yang left the library and went back to his living quarters, where a mature woman stood in front of his door with an irritated expression on her face.</p><p>The moment the mature woman saw Su Yang, her eyes widened. \"Su Yang! Where have you been all day?! Do you have any idea how long I have been waiting here for you? A mere disciple like you dare to make a sect elder like me wait all day in front of your door? Do you have any idea how much face I have lost today because of you?!\"</p><p>Su Yang smiled at the sight of Elder Lan fuming with anger, something he found somewhat cute and charming. \"Greetings, Elder Lan. What business does a respectful sect elder such as yourself have with me, a mere Outer Court disciple?\" he greeted her with a bow.</p><p>\"Hmph!

Injury? You are not injured…\"</p><p>\"You…\" Elder Lan\'s expression froze at his words. What did he mean by that? She\'s clearly injured and he\'s well aware of it!</p><p>\"What do you mean by that?\" she asked.</p><p>\"The pain in your rear is not an injury but an illness— a condition of sorts.\" Su Yang said in a nonchalant tone.</p><p>\"What did you say? An illness? How is that possible?

Elder Lan didn\'t move and stared at him with a serious expression, wondering what he was up to.</p><p>Suddenly, Su Yang brought his face closer to her\'s, and he took a deep breath through his nose, almost like a dog sniffing a scent.</p><p>\"What do you think you are doing!?\" Elder Lan took a few hasty steps back, her face reddening from his unexpected actions. \"Are you looking to die?!\"</p><p>\"As I thought, you are still pure with your chastity intact – a pure maiden.\" Su Yang smiled.</p><p>\"What… H-How did you–\"</p><p>His words caused Elder Lan to tremble, and her eyes widened from shock. How could he possibly know that she is still a virgin? Did Qi Yue run her mouth to him?</p><p>\"It would be hard enough to find someone within this sect to have a pure body at my age, let alone a sect elder such as yourself, Elder Lan.\" Su Yang sat back down on the bed, his gaze sharpened. \"You have cultivated a technique meant for dual cultivators, yet you remain as a pure maiden to this day. You are simply courting death…\"</p><p>Elder Lan also became serious after hearing his words. \"Tell me more,\" she said.</p><p>\"Dual cultivation is when a man and woman indulge in sexual intercourse by using the Yin within the woman and the Yang within the man to cultivate — this I\'m sure you are familiar with. Yet you cultivate normally using a technique meant for dual cultivation. Of course, there will obviously be side effects. The Yin within your body is currently unstable. If you continue going down this route, then you will only experience even greater pain, eventually falling apart and dying an early death…\"</p><p>The more Elder Lan listened to Su Yang\'s explanation the deeper her frown got. Could her cultivation method really be the reason that she\'s in so much pain?</p><p>\"And you are supposed to be a sect elder who guides her disciples? How laughable.\" Su Yang snorted coldly.</p><p>\"You…!\" Anger flashed across Elder Lan\'s eyes, but she didn\'t say anything — she couldn\'t. If what he said was true, then she can only blame herself for being too prideful.</p><p>\"If what you are saying is true, then what are you suggesting? That I should hurry up and go spread my legs for a man?\"</p><p>Su Yang stared at the quivering light in her eyes for a moment. He then shook his head and said: \"While that would be the most efficient and quickest way to balance your Yin… I have another method that does not require you to spread anything. However, I am only willing to do it if you accept three conditions.\"</p><p>Elder Lan turned silent, her gaze still with hesitation.</p><p>\"What are these conditions?\" she asked.</p><p>Su Yang lifted his fingers one by one and said: \"One, you will be here once a week for the next three months for treatment. Two, you will not speak of whatever happens in this room to anyone – not even your seniors. And lastly, you are to be my sponsor for this service and advertise for me.\"</p><p>\"What? You want me to advertise for you, an Outer Court disciple? You must be out of your mind! I am a sect elder! I am still too young to throw my face around like candy! I refuse!\" Elder Lan crossed her arms, looking adamant on her decision.</p><p>\"Is that so? Then, good luck to you, Elder Lan. I have already given you the answer you seek for treatment. If there is nothing else you need, please leave... and don\'t forget to close the door after yourself.\"</p><p>Su Yang laid on the bed and closed his eyes as though he wanted to take a nap.</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>\".....\"</p><p>\"....\"</p><p>Elder Lan could only stand there with a bewildered expression, her body trembling from anger. Not once since she became a sect elder 10 years ago had she experienced such disregard and disgrace from anyone, let alone a mere Outer Court disciple! Not once – until she met Su Yang!</p><p>\"Su Yang! How dare you talk to a sect elder with such a disrespectful tone! I have tolerated your attitude for far too long! I will have you expelled from this sect by tomorrow!\"</p><p>However, despite her loud voice filled with anger – despite being threatened with expulsion from the sect – Su Yang remained unmoving on his bed with a comfortable expression on his face, almost as if none of her words had entered his ears.</p><p>\"Su Yang…!\" Elder Lan growled his name in a low voice. \"I will remember this!\"</p><p>Just as she was prepared to storm out of his room, an excruciating pain appeared in her buttocks, causing her to fall on her knees. \"Why now?!\" she cursed inwardly.</p><p>It was at this moment Su Yang opened his eyes, and Elder Lan\'s round rear was the first and only thing he could see.</p><p>After struggling on the ground for a half a minute, Elder Lan finally gave up.</p><p>\"S-Su… Yang… I… I accept your… conditions!

Please!\" she said in a crying voice, tears falling off the corners of her closed eyes.</p><p>Su Yang sighed as he rolled his sleeves. \"Very well… stick your butt towards my way and don\'t move…\"  						<br/></p>'),(72,4,'Chapter 12 Overwhelmed by Pleasure',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 12 Overwhelmed by Pleasure</h3><p></p><p>                          Su Yang\'s fair hands approached Elder Lan\'s rear with a calm expression on his face, seemingly unaffected by the situation, as though he was used to it.</p><p>A second later, he lifts her robes, revealing her snow-white buttocks, silky red undergarment, and her long, smooth legs.</p><p>Her butt was round, perky and smooth-looking, like two pieces of beautiful pearl next to each other. Even in his previous life, Su Yang has not seen many maidens with buttocks as beautiful and flawless as Elder Lan\'s.</p><p>He gently caressed it as though it was a fragile treasure. The moment Su Yang\'s finger touched the surface of Elder Lan\'s jade-like skin, her body trembled. He then pushed all ten of his fingers deep into her soft buttcheeks, sending a shock of pleasure through her body.</p><p>\"Ahhh~!\" Elder Lan unintentionally moaned from the sudden pleasure in midst her immense pain. She wasn\'t in the right mind to pay attention to what Su Yang was doing behind her, but whatever it was, she wanted more.</p><p>Su Yang continued to massage her butt, and the way he massaged it made it look as though he was kneading bread, each movement made with flawless precision.</p><p>Elder Lan\'s pain gradually subdued, and pleasure quickly overwhelmed her.</p><p>\"Ahh… more... ahhh…\" Her body began feeling lust for the first time, and she unconsciously pleaded for more. Her black eyes flickered like the stars in a night sky, and a dark spot appeared in the middle of her red undergarment between her legs, gradually growing larger and darker.</p><p>Her bottom lips suddenly felt a tingling sensation, and her body began trembling even harder. Elder Lan felt fear and nervousness; she knew that this pleasure would soon consume her body and soul, yet she didn\'t tell Su Yang to stop.</p><p>\"S-Something… something is coming…!\" She suddenly felt an urge to pee.</p><p>It was at this moment Su Yang slid a finger underneath her underwear, touching the most sensitive part of her body – the clitoris.</p><p>The moment his finger touched her little pink jewel, Elder Lan felt as though her body was struck by lighting, temporarily shutting down her mind and body for an instant. And in that instant, the dam blocking the water within her body was released, causing a flow of sparkling water to gush out like a fountain.</p><p>\"Ahhhh!\" Elder Lan, for the first time in her life, has finally experienced an orgasm.</p><p>Su Yang retrieved his hand that was soaking wet from Elder Lan\'s virgin juice from under her robe and casually dried it with his own robe.</p><p>\"Since the Yin within your body was unstable, the only other option was to have your body release them.\" Su Yang said to Elder Lan, who was laying on the cold floor, her body still twitching from the aftermath, and he continued: \"I will also give you a prescription later on. Be sure to take it every day or the pain will return before our next treatment.\"</p><p>\"Haaa… haaa… haaa…\" Elder Lan did not reply to him; she was too busy trying to breathe properly. The inside of her mind was chaotic, it was as though a thousand beasts were rampaging within.</p><p>Su Yang did not bother her and went to wash his hands. Afterward, he took out a pen and paper and began writing a prescription for her.</p><p>By the time he was done, Elder Lan had only just calmed down… mentally. She propelled herself off the floor and glared at Su Yang with killing intent, her face beet red like a tomato.</p><p>Time passed extremely slowly at this moment; it felt as though time had stopped for Elder Lan. Never in her life would she have imagined that her body would be played around in such a fashion by a mere Outer Court disciple. Just thinking about the shameless expressions she made and how vulgar she acted during the treatment was enough for her to want to kill herself. Furthermore, the fact that she enjoyed it immensely only made her feel worse.</p><p>\"Here\'s your prescription, don\'t forget to take it…\" Su Yang handed a piece of paper to her.</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Seeing how Elder Lan sat there like a stone statue, Su Yang sighed. \"Don\'t think too much about it; it was just treatment for your illness. Just act as though nothing happened…\"</p><p>\"...Act as though nothing happened...? Do you think I can do something like that?!\" Elder Lan suddenly shouted, causing Su Yang to lift an eyebrow.</p><p>\"My body is now dirty from your hands! All the efforts that I have spent into keeping it pure are now worthless! Not to mention you are only a mere Outer Court disciple and I am a sect elder! How are you going to take responsibility?!\"</p><p>\"D-Dirty?\" Su Yang\'s suddenly frowned. \"How ungrateful! Even after all the efforts that I had put into saving you from your misery! Do you have any idea how many women in this world would die to have their body touched by me? Hmph! Get out!\" He coldly snorted, feeling enraged for the first time since his rebirth.</p><p>Elder Lan\'s expression froze after seeing the cold look on Su Yang\'s usually calm face, and a feeling of fear appeared in her heart.</p><p>\"I… I…\" Elder Lan suddenly bit her lips. She then forced herself to stand up, and despite having no strength remaining in her legs, she managed to walk herself out the door… after stumbling and falling a few times on the way there.</p><p>After Elder Lan\'s figure disappeared from his sight, Su Yang collapsed on the bed with an exhausted expression. \"Really... an ungrateful woman…\" he smiled bitterly before slowly falling asleep.  						<br/></p>'),(73,4,'Chapter 13 Feeling Ashamed',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 13 Feeling Ashamed</h3><p></p><p>                          It took all of Elder Lan\'s energy and effort to walk back to her living quarters. Her legs would give up every so often, and the tingling sensation around her bottom lips has yet to subdue, causing slight water to flow out with every step she took. When the disciples saw her, they believed that she was extremely drunk.</p><p>When she finally arrived at her living quarters, she noticed the little girl dozing off by the door.</p><p>\"Qi Yue…\" Elder Lan\'s mood became better at the sight of her cute face.</p><p>\"Sister Lan! You are back!\" Qi Yue finally noticed her approaching figure and quickly stood up.</p><p>\"How did it go? Were you able to meet with senior apprentice-brother Su?\" she mentioned the one name Elder Lan didn\'t want to hear at this moment.</p><p>\"...I found him…\" she sighed.</p><p>\"Then was he able to help you?\"</p><p>Despite not wanting to answer her question, Elder Lan bit her lips and slowly nodded.</p><p>\"Then why are you walking like that… oh…\" Qi Yue quickly realized how stupid her question was. How could she not recognize Elder Lan\'s sloppy movements when she, herself, had gone through the same ordeal?</p><p>Elder Lan frowned when she noticed Qi Yue blushing. Why would she be blushing?</p><p>Suddenly, Elder Lan recalled the night Qi Yue came to her house when she spoke of Su Yang. She remembered very clearly the way Qi Yue walked around with her tofu legs, almost as though she had experienced something that absorbed all the strength in her.</p><p>\"No… no way… did Su Yang also touch you…?\" Elder Lan covered her mouth with shock, not daring to believe her thoughts.</p><p>Qi Yue misunderstood the meaning behind Elder Lan\'s question and nodded sheepishly.</p><p>\"That bastard Su Yang! Forget about me, how dare he touch someone as young Qi Yue?! She is only 12!\" Elder Lan cursed at him inwardly.</p><p>\"I\'ll kill him! I will definitely kill that pervert!\" she growled in a low voice.</p><p>Qi Yue looked at her with a shocked expression. \"Sister Lan?\"</p><p>\"And you, Qi Yue! The sect forbids those under the age of 16 to indulge in any sexual practices no matter how minor that action may be! You think I will turn a blind eye to it just because of our relationship?\"</p><p>Qi Yue blinked a few times in quick succession, looking a bit dazed at Elder Lan\'s frowning face. \"What does Sister Lan by that?\" she asked in an innocent voice.</p><p>\"You are still acting ignorant now? You just said it yourself, that Su Yang had touched you!\"</p><p>\"Ah!\" Qi Yue finally comprehended the situation and flustered: \"You\'re wrong! Senior apprentice-brother Su did not do anything of that sorts to me! He only sucked the poison out of my legs after loosening up my muscle!\"</p><p>Elder Lan\'s expression froze at her words. \"What? But…\"</p><p>\"Senior apprentice-brother Su is not a pervert! He only did what he had to in order to treat my legs!\" Qi Yue said in a slightly angry tone. Even if it was her beloved elder sister, she cannot stay calm when someone bad-mouths the one who saved her life.</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>It was a first even for her to see Qi Yue get so emotional for someone she just met. And the image of Su Yang\'s cold expression appeared in her head, causing a stir within her heart.</p><p>\"He only did he had to in order to save her…\" Elder Lan looked down at her body; there was no pain… only pleasure.</p><p>\"If he wanted to, he could\'ve taken advantage of me during my state of vulnerability, even taking my chastity, yet he didn\'t do such a thing.\" Elder Lan was sure that during the heat of the moment, she would not have refused Su Yang if he wanted to take things one, even two or three steps further. She began regretting the harsh words she said to him. Not to mention she was the one who approached him for help and not the other way around.</p><p>\"I took the shame I had for myself upon him as anger and offended him… ahh… I am really stupid…\" Elder Lan sighed deeply. She was ashamed of herself when she realized what had happened during the treatment, how she was acting like a dog in heat.</p><p>The lustful expression on her face, the vulgar words that came out of her mouth, the way her body desired more – everything she acted upon during Su Yang\'s treatment had caused her to be ashamed of herself.</p><p>\"Sister Lan…?\" Qi Yue looked at Elder Lan\'s disheartened face with a worried look.</p><p>\"You are right, Qi Yue. I apologize for speaking rudely about Su Yang. He did save your life, after all. Not to mention my butt…\" she showed her a gentle smile.</p><p>After staying with Qi Yue for a little longer, the two departed.</p><p>When she returned to her room, Elder Lan undressed and went directly to clean herself. Inside the bath, she stared at her naked body, seemingly dazed. She was recalling the time she spent inside Su Yang\'s room, remembering the way he touched her body and the immense pleasure she felt between her legs during her discharge.</p><p>Her fair hands suddenly approached her bottom lips, and she began caressing the little pink jewel inside the lips. Elder Lan wasn\'t sure why she was doing this, but her hands moved continuously, trying to replicate the heavenly sensation she felt before.</p><p>However, no matter how much she rubbed or touched herself, the feeling was just vastly different from how she felt when her body was being taken care of by Su Yang. There was something fundamentally different from the way touched her and the way she touched herself; it was as though her body was not satisfied with her own hands and only wanted Su Yang.</p><p>\"Haaa….\" Elder Lan left the bath sighing, feeling ashamed of her own actions.</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>It was already midnight by the time Su Yang woke up. The first thing he did when opening his eyes was to cultivate. He sat cross-legged on his bed, and a profound aura surrounded him.</p><p>His hands suddenly glowed a faint blue; he was cultivating the Yin he collected from Elder Lan\'s holy water. Although the amount was pitiful, it was enough to benefit his cultivation base greatly.</p><p>\"Virgins are really the best…\" Su Yang silently absorbed the Yin in his hands, his cultivation base soaring with every second.</p><p>The quality of Yin or Yang obtained from those who are pure and those who are not is like comparing heaven and earth, hence why pure maidens are valued far more in this world.</p><p>Su Yang suddenly snapped his eyes and countless flickering lights glowed within. He had a breakthrough, reaching the fifth level of Elementary Spirit Realm. As for the progress on his physique; it had barely moved. That was the difference between Qi Refiners and Body Refiners. Every hundred steps a Qi Refiner takes, a Body Refiner would have taken only ten.</p><p>Su Yang looked at the moon through the windows, feeling melancholy. The sight of the moon caused the image of a peerless beauty, who was known as the Goddess of the Moon in his past life, to appear in his thoughts.</p><p>And for the remainder of the night, he stared at the moon, recalling the exciting experiences of his past life.  						<br/></p>'),(74,4,'Chapter 14 A Group of Beauties',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 14 A Group of Beauties</h3><p></p><p>                          Elder Lan woke up early in the morning.

Is it already time for our next appointment?\" Su Yang walked out of his room with a beaming smile, and whatever Elder Lan had prepared in her mind disappeared like smoke the moment she saw his face. She then recalled the time she spent here yesterday, and her face flushed red.</p><p>Elder Lan could feel her heart beating erratically, like war drums. This is the first time she\'s been so flustered at the sight of someone, let alone a man. Not to mention her image of Su Yang had changed dramatically overnight, and he seemed much more charming and handsome than yesterday. Even the core of her body trembled; it was as though her body could sense Su Yang\'s presence nearby, wishing to get closer.</p><p>\"You…\" Elder Lan was speechless. Although she came here with a purpose, the moment she saw Su Yang, everything in her mind blanked as though it was consumed by an invisible black hole.</p><p>\"Here, you left swiftly yesterday and forgot to bring this with you…\" Su Yang handed her the paper with her prescription on it.</p><p>Elder Lan instinctively accepted the paper with stiff movements, her eyes still glued to Su Yang\'s face.</p><p>\"Why? Why are you doing this…?\" she suddenly mumbled. \"Despite all the harsh things I said to you, you\'re still willing to help me?\"</p><p>Her words wiped the smile off Su Yang\'s face. He looked at her with a calm expression, his gaze flickering with a profound light.</p><p>\"Because I am a man...\" Su Yang\'s simple sentence threw both Elder Lan and Tang Hu off their feet. What kind of answer was that? Because he is a man?</p><p>\"...I am a man of my words. You asked me for help and I gave you my word that I will help you. That\'s the only reason I need to help you.\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>His words left Elder Lan speechless.</p><p>\"Are you not satisfied with my answer?\"</p><p>After a moment, Elder Lan sighed. \"No, that\'s more than enough.\"</p><p>She turned around and walked towards the door. \"I will also keep my words and fulfill the conditions,\" she said to him before leaving with a bitter smile.</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>\"Su Yang, what\'s your relationship with Elder Lan?\" Tang Hu asked after she left. Their interaction gave him many questions with little answers, and he was curious.</p><p>\"Just a customer of mine…\" Su Yang said casually.</p><p>\"C-Customer…?\" Tang Hu became even more puzzled. What kind of customer and for what service? However, he decided not to probe their relationship any further. He had a feeling that if he did, he would surely regret it.</p><p>Su Yang left the house shortly after Elder Lan disappeared. There was only one place he would go so early in the morning – the training grounds.</p><p>However, he brought with him a new sign, one that read –</p><p>\"Heavenly Massage – experience 10 minutes of heaven at the low cost of 10 Premium Points!\"</p><p>The sign caused many odd expressions to stare at him. Getting 10 Premium Points would require the completion of a low-rank mission that may take days to finish, yet Su Yang wanted to charge someone that much for a mere massage that was obviously exaggerated?</p><p>\"Su Yang! There\'s a limit to how shameless you can be!\"</p><p>\"10 Premium Points for some shitty massage?! That\'s robbery in daylight!\"</p><p>\"I wouldn\'t even let you touch me for free, let alone pay 10 Premium Points!\"</p><p>The training grounds suddenly became lively with Su Yang\'s presence. Everybody there laughed at him and his sign, yet they were also secretly surprised.</p><p>If they recalled it correctly, Su Yang\'s first sign stated that the first three would be free. Now that he\'s actually charging them, does this mean there were actually three idiots who were willing to trust him with their body?</p><p>Su Yang stood there for the entire morning without a single customer. The training ground was quiet again with the disciple bored of talking about Su Yang. However, the moment the sunset arrived, a group of ten disciples appeared near the gate, seemingly looking for someone.</p><p>Because everybody within that group was a beauty, they quickly caught the attention of the disciples training there.</p><p>\"Why are the people from the Medicine Hall doing here? Is someone hurt?\" Some disciples there recognized their red and white robes.</p><p>One of the beauty suddenly noticed Su Yang and his sign, alerting the rest of the group.</p><p>Everybody there watched as the group approached Su Yang, their gaze filled with curiosity.</p><p>\"Are you Su Yang?\" asked the beauty leading the group.</p><p>\"I am.\"</p><p>\"Great. I have heard great praises about your massage service from our Master. She advised us to come here and experience it for ourselves.

How did he manage to gather so many beauties at once, even convincing them to follow him home? Since when did he become such a playboy?</p><p>\"They are my customers.\" Su Yang said with a nonchalant expression.</p><p>\"Customers? Again?\" Tang Hu wondered if they are the same type of customer as Elder Lan.

She had a feeling that if she were to lay on that bed, then she may never live her life in the same light again.</p><p>\"Junior apprentice-sister Yu… go ahead and lay on the bed… you won\'t regret it…\" Xuan said to her with a gentle smile that was also a malicious grin.

She could not help but recall herself being in the same shoe just minutes ago; it was as though she was watching herself instead.</p><p>\"Th...This is what senior apprentice-sister Xuan saw when watching me!?\" she wanted to cry but no tears came out…</p><p>Yu wasn\'t sure how loud she was moaning during the treatment, but she figured that it must have been pretty loud since she didn\'t hold back.</p><p>\"I cannot look at senior apprentice-sister Xuan in the face ever again or I will die from shame!\"</p><p>\"More… more! Touch me more, daddy!\"</p><p>\"Ehhh?!?!?\" Yu\'s eyes popped out of its sockets when Shang addressed Su Yang as her \'daddy\'.</p><p>Even Su Yang couldn\'t help but raise an eyebrow. The last time someone called him \'daddy\', he was nearly kidnapped and imprisoned to be a sex slave for the girl.</p><p>However, Shang didn\'t seem to be aware of what she\'d just said and continued moaning, shocking Yu even further.</p><p>\"Did I… also say something that embarrassing? I don\'t remember! I can\'t remember anything!\"</p><p>While panicking, Yu continued watching her senior apprentice-sister Shang scream in pleasure, her body trembling at every moan, and the image of her senior apprentice-sister Shang – whom she held with high regards and respected greatly – would only slowly shatter in her mind the longer she watched.</p><p>However, despite all the embarrassment she was experiencing, Yu couldn\'t help but continue staring with unblinking eyes, it was as though she was mesmerized by the heavenly scene.</p><p>\"I want to switch places…\" she sighed some moments later.  						<br/></p>'),(77,4,'Chapter 17 Horrifying yet Tempting',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 17 Horrifying, yet Tempting</h3><p></p><p>                          Shang stared at Su Yang with fierce eyes, her hands covering her body in a protective manner.

Do you want me to acknowledge you as my daughter?\" Su Yang smiled, causing Shang\'s blood to boil from embarrassment.</p><p>\"I… I will remember this!\" Shang mumbled in a low voice, her gaze staring daggers at Su Yang.</p><p>\"I\'m sure you will,\" Su Yang shrugged at her words; he has heard the same words too many times in his previous life.</p><p>Yu wiped the drool from the corner or her lips and thought to herself: \"He managed to make all three of us experience heaven without touching any inappropriate spots… If he did… would we experience an even higher heaven?\"</p><p>Yu suddenly desired to feel Su Yang\'s hands caressing her bottom lips, perhaps even exploring directly inside her pink world.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Sometime later, Yu and Shang walked out of Su Yang\'s room, both looking exhausted.</p><p>\"Senior apprentice-sister Shang!

If there is nobody else, then—\"</p><p>\"Wait! I am next!

Her body was so sensitive that even something as simple as standing was deemed impossible after one try.</p><p>\"Anyone else?\" Su Yang glanced at the remaining girls, sending chills down their spines.</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Never in their dreams would these girls even imagine that they would one day encounter a situation this horrifying yet tempting at the same time.</p><p>The girls no longer saw this situation as a bet but more of a challenge from Su Yang, who was saying with his smile: \"You think you can resist my techniques? Come! I dare you!\"</p><p>\"I am next!\"</p><p>Another girl walked forward, and they entered the room.</p><p>Ten minutes later, the girl comes out with messy hair and a reddened face.</p><p>The hope in the girls\' eyes dimmed with every defeat. Their chances of getting the Profound Yin Pill was looking grimmer and more impossible.</p><p>However, despite that, they all dared to challenge Su Yang. None of them were willing to lose face by admitting defeat to some kid who was years behind them in age and experience.</p><p>But alas, the moment Su Yang executed his techniques, the girls all surrendered their bodies, even pleading for more.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Soon, only one girl who has yet to experience the massage remained.</p><p>\"Senior apprentice-sister Xiao… it is your turn…\"</p><p>\"Junior apprentice-sister Xiao… you are the only one who hasn\'t…\"</p><p>Disciple Xiao looked at her fellow sisters with a horrified expression.</p><p>\"But...But I already have a partner… I cannot allow another man to…\" Xiao tried to excuse herself out of this one, but her sisters sneered.</p><p>\"Hmph! We all have our own partners, too!\"</p><p>\"It\'s not like he\'s doing anything vulgar… it\'s just a normal massage…\"</p><p>\"Which part of this is normal?! Look at all of you laying on the floor! Look into the mirror and see the expression you are all making! Not even the roughest dual cultivation could possibly make all of you look this shameful! What happened to your elegance?!\" Xiao still refused. Just a glance at Su Yang standing by his room caused her to tremble. Standing there, Su Yang looked like the devil, and the entrance to the room was the door to hell — a place that will consume one\'s soul.</p><p>\"I will not force anyone that does not want my service,\" Su Yang said. \"If that is all, then we are done here.\"</p><p>The girls looked at Xiao with pity in their gaze. She has no idea what she\'d just missed out on and will surely regret her decision one day.</p><p>\"Umm... Su Yang…\" Disciple Yu suddenly called for him, her face showing signs of shyness.</p><p>\"What is it?\" He turned to look at her.</p><p>\"I-If you ever need help, you can come to me, Yu Yan, for advice… Although I am only an Outer Court disciple, as someone from the Medicine Hall, I have many connections within the sect… so if you ever need something, you can come to me…\"</p><p>\"How sly!\" The other girls looked at her with wide eyes.

This is all because of Su Yang!\" Xiao couldn\'t bear to watch her fellow apprentice-sisters shatter their images anymore, so she turned and left the place.</p><p>When Xiao left, the others sighed. Although a bit exaggerated, they believed that their reactions are justified.</p><p>The commotion quickly subdued, and when the girls prepared to leave, Su Yang reminded them: \"Don\'t forget your words.\"</p><p>\"Let alone ten people, I shall spread your service to everyone I know.\"</p><p>\"Me too!\"</p><p>\"I will see you next month…\"</p><p>\"...Me too…\"</p><p>Su Yang watched the girls depart with a gentle smile on his face. When they left, Tang Hu fell to the floor with a shocked face.</p><p>He couldn\'t believe it. Since when did Su Yang become popular, even causing so many senior apprentice-sisters to fall on their knees for him?</p><p>Su Yang glanced at Tang Hu and chuckled. \"Get used to it, there will be plenty more coming later.\"</p><p>\"Plenty more…\" Tang Hu rolled his eyes, nearly falling unconscious.

He sat cross-legged on his bed, his eyes closed.</p><p>He took a deep breath through his nose, enjoying the flowery fragrance emitting from the bed. The scent of those nine girls still lingered, and it smelled like a flower bed with nine different unique flowers.</p><p>Besides the lingering fragrance, the bed also emitted faint Yin Qi. This Yin Qi came from those nine girls who had discharged themselves during their climaxes.</p><p>Su Yang used what little Yin Qi remained on the bed to cultivate himself. Although laughable when compared to Elder Lan\'s virgin Yin Qi, it was still enough to benefit his cultivation base slightly.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tang Hu opened the door to another visitor.</p><p>\"Meng Jia…\" Tang Hu was greeted by his partner at the door.</p><p>\"What\'s wrong? You seem down…\" Meng Jia said in a worried tone.</p><p>\"I think you should stay away from this place for sometime…\"</p><p>\"What!?\"  Meng Jia instantly paled. \"Did I do something wrong? Something to upset you?\"</p><p>The way Tang Hu worded his sentence made it seem like Meng Jia had done something to offend him, hence why he wanted her to stay away from him for now.</p><p>\"Eh? No, no, no. You didn\'t do anything wrong. It\'s just that… this place will get chaotic soon…\" Tang Hu corrected himself the instant he realized the misunderstanding.</p><p>\"Chaotic? How? What\'s happening?\" Meng Jia couldn\'t wrap her head around the situation.</p><p>\"Su Yang… I don\'t know what he\'s trying to do, but whatever it is, he will get himself in situations I don\'t dare to imagine…\" Tang Hu recalled the bizarre situation this morning. If it continues to happen, then it will only be a matter of time before Su Yang offends someone he cannot afford to offend.</p><p>\"Su Yang? Where is he right now?\"</p><p>\"He\'s inside his room… Doing what, I have no idea. However, you need to stay away from this place… him…\" Tang Hu was anxious for Meng Jia, who might fall into Su Yang\'s hands if she were to experience his massage that caused those nine girls to go crazy.</p><p>In this sect, while disciples are not allowed to force another to participate in dual cultivation, there was no such rule that prevents one from stealing another disciple\'s partner. If it\'s Su Yang, Tang Hu believes that he could easily snatch girls away from people as easy as taking candy from a baby.</p><p>Just thinking about the possibility of Su Yang stealing Meng Jia from his grasp made Tang Hu feel anxious.</p><p>\"Whatever you are worried about, I will make it go away in bed! Come, let\'s cultivate,\" said Meng Jia as she pulled Tang Hu into his room, not giving him time to refuse.</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>Su Yang stayed locked inside his room until the sunset arrived. He organized the bed and took a quick bath before heading back out to the training grounds to wait for more customers.</p><p>Although he is still miles away from reaching 10,000 Premium Points for the Pure Yang Flower, Su Yang was confident that he will be able to obtain that much in the next few days.</p><p>A few minutes later, Su Yang arrived at the training grounds. Upon his arrival, Su Yang noticed the large group of beauties standing around where he would normally set up his sign. There were at least 30 figures gathered there, and they all looked as though they were waiting for something – or somebody.</p><p>Furthermore, the moment Su Yang stepped foot inside the training ground, somebody shouted: \"There\'s Su Yang!\"</p><p>When the group of girls heard the name \'Su Yang\', they all turned to look at him with curiosity on their faces.</p><p>\"He\'s \'that\' Su Yang, right? Does he really have such heaven-defying hand techniques?\"</p><p>\"I don\'t know, but senior apprentice-sister Xuan promised us that she will give each of us 200 Premium Points if his service does not satisfy us…\"</p><p>\"10 Premium Points, right? Hehe, senior apprentice-sister Xuan will surely regret making that promise with us after we are done here!\"</p><p>The girls approached Su Yang with gleeful expressions.</p><p>\"Su Yang, we are all here to experience your techniques. If you cannot satisfy us, then you\'d better apologize to senior apprentice-sister Xuan for causing her to lose face for you!\"</p><p>Su Yang smiled and said: \"If I am unable to satisfy even one of you girls, then I will gladly cut off my own hands and feed it to the pigs.\"</p><p>Su Yang\'s confident voice and bold statement alongside his calm expression dumbfounded the girls.</p><p>\"Heh… you seem very confident in your own abilities, but I hope you won\'t regret your words afterward!\"</p><p>After the girls accepted his three conditions, Su Yang led them to his living quarters. Meanwhile, Tang Hu began freaking out when he noticed the massive group of girls following Su Yang from the windows.</p><p>\"How did he gather so many customers in such a short time?! He just left the house, too!\" Tang Hu began moving the furniture to the walls so it would not be too crowded inside the house. He also made sure to put chairs right outside Su Yang\'s room so they could be reached easily when his customers come out. Afterward, Tang Hu holed himself inside his room, afraid of the mayhem that may soon occur.</p><p>Upon arriving at the front door, Su Yang said to the girls: \"Because the place is small, I will have at most 10 people inside at once, and the rest will have to wait outside.\"</p><p>Although unhappy, the girls did not complain.</p><p>When Su Yang saw the changes made to the house, he nearly laughed. \"What a thoughtful guy,\' he thought.</p><p>\"Now... who\'s first?\" Su Yang stood by the door to his room with a welcoming smile, his gaze at the beauties in the room.  						<br/></p>'),(79,4,'Chapter 19 The Only and True Path to Heaven',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 19 The Only and True Path to Heaven</h3><p></p><p>                          Su Yang opened the door, and his fifth customer staggered out of the room with a dazed expression, seemingly drunk from alcohol.</p><p>When the girls outside saw her condition, they forcefully swallowed their saliva in shock.</p><p>\"This is already the fifth one… could his technique really be that good?\"</p><p>\"Just looking at the expression on their faces when they come out makes my body heat up for some reason…\"</p><p>\"Who\'s next?! Hurry up! We don\'t have all day here!\"</p><p>Some girls were getting impatient from waiting. Just seeing the blissful expression on those who received Su Yang\'s massage was enough to make their hearts itch, wishing that it would be their turn already.</p><p>As for those who had already experienced Su Yang\'s techniques, some stayed inside the house sitting on the chairs prepared for them, as they are unable to walk, while others were forced to stop and answer questions.</p><p>\"How did it feel?\"</p><p>\"It was… otherworldly… it felt as though I was drifting along the stars in the starry sky…\"</p><p>\"On a scale of 1 to 10, how good was it?\"</p><p>\"Scale?

However, the line outside his house did not shorten. Instead, it has actually gotten longer than before.</p><p>Su Yang lifted an eyebrow at the queue outside his house. There was at least another 30 people standing outside. Where did these girls come from? He was positive that he didn\'t bring them here from the training ground.</p><p>The only answer he could think of was that these girls came here after learning of this place from his previous customers.</p><p>\"I need to do some adjustments…\" Su Yang halted his service for a few minutes to put up a sign right outside his house.</p><p>The sign hung above the door to his house, and it read: \"Su Yang\'s Massage – The Only and True Path to Heaven! 10 Premium Points for Service.\"</p><p>After looking at the sign with satisfaction, Su Yang went back to his room to resume service.</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>24 hour had passed since Su Yang hung the sign outside his house, yet the queue outside his house remained. Ever since the nine sisters from the Medicine Hall experienced Su Yang\'s techniques, they began spreading his name like wildfire throughout the Outer Court. The people were suspicious at first, but when more and more people began spreading the same words, it became easier for others to believe in Su Yang\'s services.</p><p>Some people approached Su Yang for his service out of curiosity and others went for genuine pleasure, and sure enough, every single figure that went into Su Yang\'s room came out looking anew, as though they have been reborn.</p><p>And for the next two days, Su Yang accepted all sorts of beauty into his room with a welcoming smile with very little rest.</p><p>Graceful ladies with slim waists and round butts, enchanting women with mature bodies and large breasts, even immature girls that are yet considered adults – they all approached Su Yang to experience his techniques.</p><p>At one point, his name reached even a few Inner Court disciple.</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>Very quickly, the outside of Su Yang\'s house became lively with dozens of customers laughing and joking with each other as they queued up, each talking about their expectations; it looked like the gathering of flowers, making the place look more like a marketplace rather than someone\'s living quarter.</p><p>By the fourth day, almost everybody within the Outer Court has heard of Su Yang and his divine techniques, whether they like it or not. From the animals to the sect elders, they would hear the disciples talk about their experiences with Su Yang whenever they go anywhere outside.</p><p>\"Su Yang? That mentally ill Outer Court disciple? Why is everyone and their mother talking about him as of lately?\" The unusual situation within the Outer Court caused the sect elders to pay more attention to Su Yang.</p><p>However, the more they talked about him, the more puzzling the situation became. How could someone like Su Yang, who was infamous and disliked by many, become so popular within the sect almost out of nowhere? He has nearly all the female disciples talking about him. As for those who have yet to experience his techniques, they will sooner or later talk about him, too.</p><p>\"My disciples also talked about him nonstop the other day. They were all giggling like little kids who had just returned from an amusement park…\"</p><p>\"Your disciples, too? My only disciple has been staring at the clouds all day while sighing his name ever since she went to his house two days ago…\"</p><p>\"The partners of my disciples have been complaining to me about how they are unable to satisfy the girls with their techniques anymore...\"</p><p>\"Quite a few male disciples have tried to cause trouble at Su Yang\'s place, but they all ended up getting forced away before they could even reach his doorstep…\"</p><p>\"This is becoming quite problematic, huh… What should we do? Stop his little business?\"</p><p>\"I don\'t think that would be a good idea. There will definitely be a riot if his business is forced to shut down.\"</p><p>\"Aiya… then what should we do?\"</p><p>The elders felt infuriated at the situation, but they were truly at lost and did not know how to deal with it.</p><p>\"Should we go to the Matriarch for a solution?\"</p><p>\"No, we don\'t need to bother the Matriarch over something like this – not yet. We should wait a bit longer and see how this plays out.\"</p><p>After some time, the elders finally came to a conclusion.</p><p>\"Very well. We will sit back and only watch for now. However, if it gets out of hand, then we will have to intervene.\"</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>Inside his room, Su Yang glanced at the jade slip in his hands.</p><p>\"5,514 Premium Points after four long days. At this rate, I will die from exhaustion before getting my hands on the Pure Yang Pill…\" His arms prickled with pain from soreness, and his fingers were numb.</p><p>Although he has worked for far longer without rest before, his current mortal body could not withstand the burden of him constantly utilizing his techniques.</p><p>Su Yang looked outside the window, and there were at least 50 people still in line.</p><p>After pondering for some time, he decided to go outside to announce a few changes.</p><p>\"Due the to high demand, I have decided to change the price from 10 Premium Points to 100 Premium Points. Additionally, I will only accept a limit of 25 people per day starting tomorrow.\"</p><p>The sudden changes caused many to frown.</p><p>\"We have waited out here for over an hour, and you want to suddenly change the price?! That\'s unreasonable!\"</p><p>\"Right?! I don\'t even have 100 Premium Points! Even if I do, I wouldn\'t waste it on some massage, no matter how good it may feel!\"</p><p>The line quickly shortened with people leaving left and right.</p><p>Suddenly, someone asked: \"Su Yang, since you upped the price, will your service also increase?\"</p><p>Su Yang calmly nodded and said: \"Naturally. The time will be increased from ten minutes to thirty minutes, and I will also guarantee you that your Yin Qi will see an increase in quality after the service.\"</p><p>\"What?! Our Yin Qi will see an increase in quality?! How is that possible!\"</p><p>The disciples did not believe him. After all, only valuable pills and precious treasures are capable of increasing one\'s Yin or Yang Qi. If there really exists a technique in this world that could increase the Yin or Yang Qi within one\'s body, then that person with the technique will definitely be treated like a God!</p><p>\"Whether it is possible or not, you will know after my service,\" said Su Yang with a nonchalant expression, and he continued: \"I apologize for the inconveniences, but I am done for today. Come back tomorrow morning if you want my service.\" He retrieved the sign and closed the doors, leaving no room for discussion.</p><p>Many people stood outside his house with a dumbfounded expression. Although they understood that he needed rest after working for so many days without closing once, they still felt anger in their hearts.</p><p>\"This Su Yang is really shameless and arrogant! Just because he\'s good with his hands he thinks that he can do whatever he wants, even being rude to his customers! Hmph! I have wasted my time here, and I will not be coming back!\"</p><p>\"Me, too!\"</p><p>\"Let\'s go!\"</p><p>Many stomped away in anger, and others sighed.</p><p>Very quickly, Su Yang\'s house became desolate and silent.</p><p>However, barely any changes occurred to Su Yang himself, and he went back inside to get some rest, as his days will only get tougher from this point forth.  						<br/></p>'),(80,4,'Chapter 20 Pure Yang Flower',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 20 Pure Yang Flower</h3><p></p><p>                          News of Su Yang changing the price for his service from 10 Premium Points to 100 Premium points, including how he will only see at most 25 customers per day, quickly spread. Many people were not happy about the changes, especially those who didn\'t get the chance to enjoy his service before when it was cheap and affordable or those who decided to wait until later. However, as for those who have already experienced his technique, they would gladly pay 100 Premium Points to feel it again.

Now if that isn\'t a bargain, then I don\'t know what is.\"</p><p>\"What?! You can increase one\'s Yin Qi?!\" Elder Lan was shocked. How come she hadn\'t heard anything like that prior to coming here?</p><p>Su Yang nodded, confirming her doubt. \"Yin and Yang Qi works similar to one\'s body.

Does it look like I am joking with you?\"</p><p>\"The fact that you are not trying to detain me at this moment is making me smile.\"</p><p>Su Yang\'s words dumbfounded Elder Lan, who blushed slightly afterward.</p><p>\"Although it does sound very enticing to see you behind bars, I am not the type to treat my own disciples as though they are tools,\" said Elder Lan, her expression emitting an air of melancholy.</p><p>Elder Lan\'s melancholy expression caused images to flash through Su Yang\'s head.</p><p>\"As I thought… they are really similar…\" he sighed inwardly.</p><p>\"Su Yang… I have been wondering… what is the purpose of all this? Why are you doing what you are doing?\" Elder Lan has been pondering why Su Yang decided to reveal to the sect his heaven-defying hand techniques ever since the day she approached him.</p><p>From her knowledge and what people say about him, Su Yang was a timid and spineless man who has mental issues and would never do something as bold and as eye-catching as opening up a massage parlor within the Outer Court.</p><p>But no matter how hard or long she pondered, she just couldn\'t wrap her head around Su Yang\'s schemes.</p><p>\"Why I am doing this?

However, it wasn\'t long before a group of people approached his house with irritated expressions on their faces, clearly here to cause trouble.</p><p>\"Su Yang! Get your ass out here right this instant! You have been hiding inside that house like a turtle in his shell while being protected by girls for the past few days, but now that you\'ve stabbed yourself in the foot, who will stop us from approaching you?!\"</p><p>\"Su Yang, I will fucking kill you for touching my girl!\"</p><p>Ever since Su Yang opened up his massage parlor, he has seen more than 500 girls. However, it was obvious that the majority of these girls if not all already has a partner within the sect. While Su Yang did not touch them vulgarly in any way, the way the girls acted afterward raised many suspicions within their partners\' heart.</p><p>And despite the girls reassuring their partners many times that Su Yang only gave them a normal massage, who in their right mind would believe that a mere massage could make them act like dogs in heat?</p><p>A few moments later, the door opened, and Su Yang calmly walked outside with a nonchalant expression.</p><p>He glanced at the dozen angry men standing before him like a group of angry protestors, and said: \"I apologize, but I do not touch men.\"</p><p>His words further increased the crowd\'s anger. \"Who the fuck said that we are here to enjoy your service?! How dare you touch my girl! Because of you, she has been refusing to cultivate with me as of lately!\"</p><p>\"Su Yang! What did you do to my Xia\'er?! After meeting you, she dared to tell me that I am \'not enough\' to satisfy her!!!\"</p><p>Hearing the crowd\'s complaints, Su Yang couldn\'t help but chuckle.</p><p>\"So, you all came here to blame another man for your inability to satisfy your own girl? And you call yourselves a man? How laughable!\"</p><p>\"What did you say?!\"</p><p>\"You are courting death, Su Yang!\"</p><p>Su Yang shrugged at their anger and said, \"It is normal for male disciples to cultivate with more than one female disciple at a time, and vice versa, so why are you all so upset that they are seeing another man besides yourself? The fact that you cannot satisfy your partners means that you are no longer useful to them! No matter how talented you are or how vigorous your Yang Qi is, if your partner does not find pleasure in cultivating with you, then you are worthless!\"</p><p>Su Yang\'s harsh words struck pain into the heart of everybody there; it felt to them as though their heart was pierced by a sharp sword.</p><p>While it was normal for disciples to have more than one cultivating partner at a time as it is more convenient and efficient than having just one, nobody there wanted to admit that Su Yang, who was known for being useless and never considered a threat to anyone, was better at pleasing their partners than them.</p><p>In a sect where dual cultivation is the norm, losing your woman to another man is far worse than death, even more so if the girl left because the other man was doing a better job at pleasing them. Furthermore, admitting defeat meant that you are accepting the fact that you are inferior to another man – a man\'s worst nightmare!</p><p>\"Su Yang! I want a deathmatch!\"</p><p>\"Me, too!\"</p><p>The crowd was so irritated and speechless that they began talking about fighting a deathmatch, as that was the only thing they could think of that would lessen the shame and embarrassment that have faced today.</p><p>\"Hmph. Besides raw strength, what else can you all say with confidence that you are superior when in front of me?\" Su Yang coldly snorted and continued: \"A bunch of kids that cannot even satisfy their own woman dares to approach my doorstep and bark like dogs, what a bunch of fools.\"</p><p>When it comes to dealing with women, Su Yang would turn into a kind prince no matter the situation. However, when he has to deal with men – annoying ones at that – he would turn into the devil and consume their confidence as a man and force them to their knees.</p><p>Even in his previous life, Su Yang was the bane of all men – an existence that would force the males into experiencing anxiety, as they fear that Su Yang would snatch their women with a mere glance!</p><p>\"You do not dare to fight me?! And you call yourself a man?!\"</p><p>\"If your techniques do not work in the battlefield, then you are just as worthless!\"</p><p>Su Yang smiled at their words and said: \"100 Premium Points and I will enter the stage for a deathmatch.\"</p><p>\"What?! You want us to pay you to fight?!\"</p><p>\"How shameless!\"</p><p>Su Yang shrugged: \"I am a busy man. If you want to waste my time, then you need to pay up, just like your partners did when they approached me for pleasure instead of you…\" he said with a grin, causing the crowd to explode in anger.</p><p>\"Su Yang!!! I will fucking kill you today! 100 Premium Points it is! Fight me to death right now!\"</p><p>\"Fuck! I will pay you 150 Premium Points to fight me first!\"</p><p>\"200!\"</p><p>Su Yang accepted the highest offer of 250 Premium Points with a smile and nodded: \"Very well. Then let us make a request to the sect and schedule our–\"</p><p>\"Right now! I want to fight right now!\"</p><p>Su Yang shook his head and said: \"I have already been warned once by a sect elder.

But you have already accepted my payment!\"</p><p>\"This and that are two different things.\"</p><p>\"Su Yang!!!\"</p><p>Su Yang only smiled with a calm expression at the raging scene. Because the sect forbids any fighting amongst disciples unless officially approved by the sect, he wasn\'t worried that they might attack him out of nowhere. However, even if they did, he was confident in his own abilities.</p><p>As someone with countless same experience in his previous life, Su Yang was not dumb enough to offend others without having absolute confidence in his victory.

The last time I checked, you are a mere Elementary Realm at the third level, and you agreed to fight someone at the fifth level of the Elementary Realm? Are you stupid or are you crazy?\" Elder Zhou looked at Su Yang with an odd expression.</p><p>In this world, unless one is a cultivation genius or happen to have a powerful weapon, they would never be able to beat another with a higher cultivation base, let alone two whole levels! And in Elder Zhou\'s eyes, Su Yang was only a mere Outer Court disciple with some talent in his hand techniques, definitely not a cultivation genius.</p><p>\"You are neither a genius nor should you have any weapon powerful enough to suppress someone two levels above you, yet you still dare to fight him? Are you courting death?\"</p><p>\"Elder Zhou! This is his choice, not mine! I did not force him to fight me; it was something he accepted with a smile on his face!\" Dai Zheng, the one who had the highest bid and the one who will be fighting Su Yang first, was worried that Su Yang may coward away from fighting him at this rate.</p><p>Su Yang remained calm despite Elder Zhou\'s harsh words, and he said with a smile: \"Elder Zhou is right, I am neither a cultivation genius nor do I have any powerful weapon. However, as a man, would you back out from a fight with your pride on the line just because you are facing someone stronger than yourself?\"</p><p>His words caused Elder Zhou to lift his brows, and to everybody\'s surprise, he answered: \"No, I would not.\"</p><p>\"Right? Then allow me to fight him.\"</p><p>Elder Zhou turned silent to ponder for a moment, and he said a few seconds later: \"This is a deathmatch with your life at risk, not some spar where you get away with only minor injuries. Once you step onto that stage, neither of you are allowed to leave until only one remains in this world.\"</p><p>Without needing to think, Su Yang nodded. \"While we are at it, we might as well schedule everyone here a deathmatch with me,\" he said nonchalantly, dumbfounding everybody there.</p><p>\"What did you just say? You want a deathmatch with everyone here?\" Elder Zhou looked at the dozen Outer Court disciples with a bewildered expression.</p><p>\"That\'s why they followed, right?\" Su Yang looked at the dazed crowd with a smile.</p><p>\"Su Yang! How arrogant of you to think that you will get the chance to fight another person before our deathmatch even started! Are you saying that you are absolutely confident in your victory?!\" Dai Zheng exploded into a rage after hearing Su Yang\'s words, feeling as though he had his face stomped by Su Yang without mercy.</p><p>Su Yang glanced at his red face that was bulging with veins and said with a surprised look: \"Why else would I fight you? To die? Are you stupid?\"</p><p>\"SUUU YANNNNG!\"</p><p>Just as Dai Zheng was a second away from attacking Su Yang out of anger, Elder Zhou coughed once, instantly forcing Dai Zheng to halt his steps.</p><p>\"Where do you think you are, disciple Dai Zheng?\" Elder Zhou\'s narrowed gaze caused Dai Zheng to freeze, seemingly petrified by his dangerous gaze.</p><p>\"T-This disciple apologizes to Elder Zhou for overstepping his boundaries.\" Dai Zheng quickly apologized with a deep bow.</p><p>Elder Zhou sighed and said: \"Since the two of you want to fight so badly, I shall accept your wish and personally oversee this deathmatch myself.\"</p><p>Dai Zheng showed a beaming smile and bowed again: \"Thank you, Elder Zhou, for giving this disciple a chance to repay his debts!\"</p><p>Su Yang snorted coldly at how Dai Zheng truly believes that he would lose to him. He originally didn\'t plan to dirty his hands with blood so soon after his reincarnation, especially when he still hasn\'t obtained the Pure Yang Flower. However, Su Yang knew very well that if he ignored these people today that they will surely come to bother him again in the future, hence why he decided to clean up the trash early so he wouldn\'t have to worry about it later.</p><p>\"When do you want this deathmatch to take place?\" Elder Zhou asked.</p><p>\"As soon as possible!\" Dai Zheng said as he stared at Su Yang with a menacing look.</p><p>\"Then how about right now? I happen to be free until right now.\"</p><p>\"This disciple will greatly appreciate that!\"</p><p>\"Disciple Su Yang?\" Elder Zhou looked at him for confirmation.</p><p>Su Yang nodded and said: \"I have no problem doing it now.\"</p><p>\"Very well, then let us head to the stage…\"</p><p>Elder Zhou began walking first and led the way.</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>\"Hey look! It\'s an official deathmatch!\"</p><p>\"What? Who\'s fighting?\"</p><p>The disciples that happened to be around the arena quickly approached the stage when they noticed Su Yang and Dai Zheng climbing the steps.</p><p>\"Elder Zhou is overseeing this deathmatch, so it really is official!\"</p><p>\"That\'s Dai Zheng! Who is he fighting… that\'s Su Yang?!\"</p><p>\"Su Yang is having another deathmatch just a week after his last one!\"</p><p>The disciples were clearly excited to witness this fight, especially after hearing rumors of Su Yang defeating Yang Ming, who was at the sixth level of Elementary Realm.</p><p>\"Are the two of you ready?\" Elder Zhou asked the two on the stage.</p><p>\"Ready!\" Dai Zheng tightly held the sword in his grasp, his breathing patterns change.</p><p>Su Yang played around with the steel sword in his hands; it was a borrowed weapon just for this fight. \"Before we start, I\'d like to tell you a story… a love story between a renowned general and a rogue cultivator,\" he said in a nonchalant manner, dumbfounding everybody there.</p><p>A love story between a general and a rogue cultivator? What the hell is going on? Since when did this deathmatch become a place for story-telling?</p><p>\"What the fuck are you talking about?! Hurry up and fight me!\" Dai Zheng said in an irritated and impatient tone, his teething itching just to see Su Yang\'s blood.</p><p>However, Su Yang ignored him and continued to speak with a calm expression on his face: \"During the Chaotic Era, when wars are considered a common sight, there existed a peerlessly beautiful woman, who happened to be a general for some powerful army.

Many generals, kings, even emperors tried to court her, but alas, none of them were successful, as she was only looking for someone who was stronger than herself, which was nearly impossible during that era.\"</p><p>Su Yang\'s calm voice and perfectly paced story-telling quickly made the place silent.</p><p>\"Then there was this young rogue cultivator who fell in love with her. However, this young man was from a common background and could be regarded as an ant in the eyes of these kings and emperors; he was someone who wasn\'t meant for her, not even in ten lifetimes.\"</p><p>\"However, despite knowing that he would never be able to stand next to her, the young man never gave up and earnestly cultivated both his body and sword techniques, wishing that it could help him close their never-ending distance…\"</p><p>Su Yang stopped the story at this point and glanced at Dai Zheng with a calm, yet overbearing gaze. \"What do you think happened to that young man?\" he asked him.</p><p>\"A fool chasing an impossible dream… what else besides the obvious would happen?\" Dai Zheng sneered.</p><p>Su Yang smiled at his answer, and he casually lifted the sword in his hands.</p><p>\"!!!\"</p><p>Suddenly, Elder Zhou\'s eyes snapped open, his gaze filled with shock and disbelief.</p><p>\"What\'s that glow surrounding his sword?\"</p><p>\"I have never seen anything like that before…\"</p><p>The disciples were puzzled by the visible aura that suddenly appeared around the steel sword in Su Yang\'s grasp, giving it an overbearing pressure and seemingly twisting the space that surrounded it.</p><p>\"Impossible! That looks like Sword Intent!\" Elder Zhou recognized the aura surrounding the sword. However, his knowledge only further confused him, even shocking him to the core.</p><p>Sword Intent is the essence of a sword; it is something that only appears when the user has complete control and comprehension over the sword, in other words, complete mastery. These users are widely known as Swordmasters, and they are highly respected figures around the world.</p><p>\"How could it possibly be Sword Intent?! He\'s just 16 years old! Not even experts at the Earth Spirit Realm would be able to emit such a powerful Sword Intent!\" Elder Zhou didn\'t dare to believe that a 16 year old idiot like Su Yang could become a Swordmaster despite the clear Sword Intent, so he forced himself to believe that Su Yang had prepared some cheap tricks in order to make it seem like Sword Intent.</p><p>Su Yang casually swung his sword, and a tyrannical pressure swept the place, sending chills down the spine of everyone there — Elder Zhou included.</p><p>\"Sword Intent relies on one\'s experience and mastery with swords. It does not matter if I am a mortal or a saint, as long as I understand the sword, I will be able to use Sword Intent,\" Su Yang recalled the countless hours he had spent trying to master the sword in his previous life.</p><p>\"You… what is your partner\'s name?\" Su Yang suddenly asked Dai Zheng, who seemed to be frozen solid ever since the domineering Sword Intent appeared.</p><p>\"Cheng Yu…\" Dai Zheng unconsciously replied.</p><p>Su Yang nodded and said in a nonchalant tone, \"Don\'t worry, I will be sure to take care of your girl after your death so she wouldn\'t be lonely without your presence… Elder Zhou, we can begin.\"</p><p>Dai Zheng directly coughed up a mouthful of blood after hearing Su Yang\'s vicious words.</p><p>To hear Su Yang say such words after all that has happened, Dai Zheng was already on the verge of death from sheer anger before the fight even began!</p><p>\"I will fucking kill you, Su Yang!\" Dai Zheng threw away his fighting stance and charged at Su Yang like a madman with red eyes. He was so angry that it made him blind and unable to see the blade slashing down at his direction.</p><p>Su Yang sighed inwardly. \"I hope this will be the first and last time I take a life in this place…\"</p><p>While Su Yang wasn\'t the type to kill people over small things, he needed to set an example for the others so it wouldn\'t happen again. In his previous life, he has encountered many situations where he showed mercy only to have them bite back twice as hard later on.</p><p>\"Wait!\" Elder Zhou hastily called out, but alas, it was too late.</p><p>The tip of the sword in Su Yang\'s grasp gently touched the ground, and a beautiful arc of light appeared, cleanly cutting Dai Zheng in half from top to bottom.</p><p>Shocked gasping resounded as organs fell. Blood splattered all over the arena and covered Su Yang, and everybody stared at the horrifying scene with wide eyes and dropped jaws, looking as though they were watching a scene from hell.</p><p>Nobody there, Elder Zhou included, have seen such a merciless strike occur on this stage before, not even in the cruelest deathmatches.</p><p>Su Yang turned around to face the shocked audience with a calm expression, and he said coldly: \"Knock on my door if you want, I will play with you, but be prepared to face the consequences.\"</p><p>The overbearing and domineering pressure Su Yang was emitting caused many there to fall on their rear. He looked like a general who has fought many wars before, someone with an unfathomable presence.</p><p>\"As for the story… that young man not only conquered the general\'s heart with his sword techniques, he also continued to achieve many impossible feats that none of these kings and emperors could have imagined possible for themselves, let alone from someone who they regarded as a mere ant…\"</p><p>Su Yang approached Elder Zhou, who stood there with a dazed face, and returned the bloody steel sword to him. \"A decent sword,\" he said to him before calmly walking off the stage.  						<br/></p>'),(84,4,'Chapter 24 His First Love',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 24 His First Love</h3><p></p><p>                          After the deathmatch between Su Yang and Dai Zheng that ended immediately after it started, Su Yang\'s name quickly became the center of attention once again. Those who happened to witness Su Yang\'s display of dominance began spreading words of the event like wildfire.</p><p>They portrayed Su Yang as though he was a devil from hell who could kill without batting an eyelid. They also mentioned the cruel scene of Dai Zheng splitting into two pieces, causing many who heard it to nearly vomit from disgust and shock.</p><p>However, what scared these disciples the most was not Su Yang\'s cruelty that allowed him to kill with ease but his sharp and harsh words that could easily kill anyone weak-hearted, especially when they learned of Su Yang\'s last words to Dai Zheng before slaying him. They all had a feeling that Su Yang was not talking only to Dai Zheng but to everybody that dared to think of causing trouble for him.</p><p>\"You dare knock on my door for trouble? Then I will take your girl before and after your death as compensation!\"</p><p>These words that could very possibly haunt them even after their deaths resounded — sounding like Su Yang\'s cold voice — in the head of those who were there to witness his deathmatch, causing them to tremble in fear even in their dreams.</p><p>Very quickly, the name Su Yang became something to be feared by the Outer Court disciples.

Are you absolutely certain about this, Elder Zhou?\"</p><p>\"I know it may sound like I am cracking a crazy joke, but I can promise you that I am absolutely serious in this matter. I also doubted it at first — I mean, who wouldn\'t doubt their eyes if they saw a 16-year-old using Sword Intent? If I never saw it with my own eyes then I wouldn\'t believe it even if you told me while beating me to death!\" Elder Zhou reassured them his seriousness.</p><p>\"A 16-year-old Swordmaster… how frightening would that be if it were true?\" However, despite Elder Zhou\'s clear voice, the others still doubted Su Yang\'s ability to use Sword Intent, as it was something unimaginable for them.</p><p>It was extremely hard for them to believe it even if such a story came out of the Matriarch\'s mouth, especially since there are currently less than ten Swordmasters still alive in this world, all who are profound and renowned experts with more than 100 years of experience under their belt.</p><p>Elder Zhou knew that his story would be hard to believe and had already prepared himself prior to the meeting, so he wasn\'t that bothered by their doubt.</p><p>\"Whatever, I give up. It doesn\'t matter if you believe me not at this point. When you see it for yourselves, then you will know the truth.\" Elder Zhou left the room while sighing, leaving the other sect elders dumbfounded.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Meanwhile, Su Yang directly went home to clean the dried blood on his body, his calm expression looking as though the deathmatch never happened.</p><p>Afterward, he laid on the bed and closed his eyes, and the scene of the moment when he first embraced the beautiful general appeared in his head.</p><p>The feeling of her smooth yet sturdy skin, her warm body, the lingering smell of the battlefield in her hair — all of that resurfaced at once in Su Yang\'s head, feeling as though it happened just yesterday.</p><p>He stayed like that for many hours, seemingly asleep, but he was actually wide awake, thinking about the precious time he had spent with his first love in his previous life, who was also the one who made him into a cultivator.</p><p>But alas, despite winning that general\'s heart, by the time he reached to that point, she was already past her prime age for growth and had long met her limit as a cultivator, and as a mortal. However, Su Yang himself continued to grow stronger, even breaking his mortal shackles in the near future, becoming an Immortal with a profound longevity that the mortals desired since the ancient times.</p><p>And because of his growth and ever-increasing cultivation, Su Yang looked the same as the day he met the general even after many years whilst the general became an old lady, who died from natural cause a few years later.</p><p>\"I fell in love with you when I was a mere kid, about the same age as currently, perhaps even younger, but you were already an adult. By the time I obtained enough strength to stand beside you, you had already existed for more than 50 years. Yet, you still looked as beautiful as when I saw your brilliance for the first time many years ago, maybe even brighter. My only regret during that era was my powerlessness – my inability to support your cultivation base while I selfishly grew stronger by myself...\"</p><p>Su Yang recalled the moment when he stood in front of her grave as a young man who looked no different than the day when he first held her hands.</p><p>\"After your death was when I truly realized the difference between Immortals and mortals, and I became a coward – a coward who feared that he might one day fall in love with another mortal and experience the same grief as he did with you – so I left the mortal world, only returning thousands of years later for a short period of time...\"</p><p>Su Yang suddenly opened his eyes, and he showed a bitter smile to the plain, boring ceiling. \"I am once again in the mortal world, and there is this sect elder who has the same stubborn demeanor as you… Is this fate, or is this a joke the heavens created just to mess with me?\"</p><p>He left the bed and walked to the windows where he noticed a young lady approaching his doorstep.

As she had not rested well last night, it was natural that she would be tired.</p><p>The more Su Shengjing observed her little face, the more he felt that she looked quite similar to him when he was young.</p><p></p><p></p><p><em>It seems like she’s definitely my daughter. </em></p><p>The wind at the room’s entrance was strong, so Su Shengjing carried Su Jiu and walked to the master bedroom. He placed her onto his bed and clumsily tucked her into the blanket.</p><p>***</p><p>Su Shengjing lay on the sofa and slept for a long time. He only woke up because his stomach growled in hunger.</p><p></p><p></p><p>He sleepily sat up and ruffled his messy hair. When he regained his senses, he suddenly saw a tiny girl crouching at a corner of the sofa, staring at him with her wide, clear eyes.</p><p>As if she were afraid of waking him up, she acted extremely obedient and did not make a single sound.</p><p>When she saw that he had woken up, she smiled brightly. “Daddy, you’re awake!”</p><p>“Um… Yeah.” Su Shengjing was not used to this new form of address, and he became embarrassed. “You’re up too. Are you hungry?”</p><p>Su Jiu touched her flat stomach and said, “I’m super hungry.”</p><p>Su Shengjing once again felt that he was not doing a good job. Back at the orphanage, he had said to Su Jiu that he would bring her home and take care of her. Yet, he had woken up later than her and made her starve.</p><p></p><p></p><p><em>She has not eaten anything since last night. She must be starving to death. </em></p><p>Su Shengjing felt guilty. “Play on your own while I cook something for you.”</p><p>Su Jiu obediently nodded. “Okay. Thank you, Daddy!”</p><p><em>Wow… How cute and adorable! </em></p><p>After being attacked by her cuteness, Su Shengjing felt like he was almost going to have a nosebleed.</p><p>He stared at her as he wondered who her mother was. <em>She must be very pretty; otherwise, how could she give birth to such an adorable daughter?</em></p><p><em>Ahem, this is not the time to think about this. </em>His child was still hungry, so Su Shengjing briskly walked to the kitchen and opened the fridge.</p><p>There were quite a lot of food items inside. However, when he took them out, he realized that they had all expired.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Su Shengjing was speechless.</p><p>He always roamed outside and rarely cooked. When he was hungry, he would order food. A long while had passed since he had last opened his fridge. That was why he was unaware of what had happened to the items inside.</p><p>Enduring the pain of throwing the expired food into the dustbin, Su Shengjing walked out of the kitchen. He then told the little girl, who was obediently waiting for him on the sofa, “I’m going to buy something. Can you stay at home alone?”</p><p>Su Jiu immediately jumped down from the sofa. “I want to go with you, Daddy.”</p><p>Su Shengjing felt helpless. “Let’s go, then.”</p><p>Actually, he would feel worried about leaving such a small child at home alone. It was better if they went together.</p><p>Su Jiu ran over happily and tugged his hand.</p><p>Su Shengjing realized that her hand was soft and chubby. It was also tiny—barely half the size of his palm. Moreover, she could only grab his finger.</p><p>A wondrous feeling attacked his heart again.</p><p>As the two of them left the house and walked downstairs, Su Jiu suddenly saw a little boy.</p>'),(94,5,'Chapter 10 Heard That He Was Mute',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 10: Heard That He Was Mute</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Atlas Studios  <strong>Editor: </strong>Atlas Studios</p><p>The kid looked like a six- or seven-year-old boy with slightly long black hair. He was dressed in a fading black shirt and beige pants.</p><p>Since he was too skinny, the clothes looked too big for him. Carrying a black plastic bag on one hand, he rummaged through the dustbin with the other. When he found a plastic bottle or aluminum can, he placed it into the plastic bag.</p><p></p><p></p><p>After rummaging through a dustbin, he turned around to find another dustbin. He seemed to be very familiar with these actions as if he had done it many times.</p><p>Su Shengjing had seen the boy a couple of times, and every time, the kid was picking up trash. As he held Su Jiu’s hand, he walked over and asked with a frown, “Why are you picking trash again? Where are your family members?”</p><p>The boy did not say anything. He just glanced at Su Shengjing, then at Su Jiu who was standing beside him. He then averted his gaze and continued rummaging through the trash.</p><p>Although it was just a short glance, it had shocked Su Jiu.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Those eyes were very deep. He was a kid who should be innocently playing in a field somewhere, yet he had a brooding and unfathomable gaze like an adult.</p><p>Furthermore, it looked like he had gone through a weathered life.</p><p>Su Shengjing took out his wallet from his pocket. He did not have a lot of money with him, and on top of that, he still had to pay for Su Jiu’s toiletries. Afraid that he would not have enough left, he could only pass a fifty-dollar note to the boy. “Here, buy something to eat.”</p><p>His actions stunned the boy, and his dark eyes stared at the bill. It made it clear that he needed it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>However, the boy knew that he could not take someone’s money so casually. Thus, he did not grab the note even after a while passed. He pursed his lips and looked very conflicted.</p><p>Su Jiu stuffed the money into the boy’s hands and smiled at him. “Big Brother, just take this money. If you think that you can’t take it for nothing, you can return it to my father after you’ve grown up and earned money.”</p><p>Her words convinced the boy, and he forcefully nodded. Then, he reached his hands out to take the money, while taking a closer look at her.</p><p><em>Did she just move here? </em></p><p><em>How cute!</em></p><p>The boy’s ears blushed, and he embarrassedly nodded. Avoiding Su Jiu’s gaze, he carefully kept the money, turned around, and continued rummaging through the dustbin.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When Su Jiu exited the neighborhood, she turned around and glanced at the boy, feeling a bit bad for him.</p><p><em>Such a small child has to pick trash. He must be leading a tough life! </em></p><p>She could not help but ask, “Daddy, who is he?”</p><p>“He lives in our building. People say that he’s mute, but I’m not sure if it’s true. Anyway, I’ve never heard him speak.”</p><p>“Why is he picking trash here? Is his family very poor?”</p><p>“Everyone who lives here is poor, including me.” Su Shengjing felt a bit guilty, and he looked at Su Jiu. “Will you dislike me for that?”</p><p>Su Jiu shook her head and brightly smiled. “Of course not! You’re the best daddy in the whole world!”</p><p>Her words melted Su Shengjing’s heart.</p><p></p><p></p><p><em>Alright!</em> Since she had said that, he decided to take responsibility from now on and work hard to raise her well!</p><p>***</p><p>When the duo reached the supermarket, Su Shengjing took a trolley, carried Su Jiu, and placed her inside it.</p><p>Su Jiu’s face flushed, and she became embarrassed.</p><p>Her real self was an adult in the end. That was why sitting in a trolley like a baby made her feel a bit… shameful.</p><p>When Su Shengjing noticed Su Jiu’s awkward expression, he thought that she did not enjoy sitting in the trolley. Hence, he lowered his head and asked, “Do you want me to hug you?”</p><p>Su Jiu rapidly shook her head. “No need, Daddy. I’ll just sit in the trolley. It’ll be so tiring for you to carry me.”</p><p>Su Shengjing almost choked up, and an indescribable sense of joy surfaced in his heart.</p><p><em>Oh my God, what kind of angel is she? </em></p><p><em>She’s simply too thoughtful! </em></p>'),(95,5,'Chapter 11 Daddy Became Impressive',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 11: Daddy Became Impressive</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Atlas Studios  <strong>Editor: </strong>Atlas Studios</p><p>It had been so long since he had last experienced the feeling of being cared for that Su Shengjing had forgotten how it felt like. At this moment, a warm feeling engulfed his heart.</p><p>Su Shengjing pushed the trolley and went to the toiletries section. When he passed by the shelf with the diapers, he subconsciously took one. After thinking about it, he asked Su Jiu, “Do you need this?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Su Jiu shook her head and earnestly said, “I don’t need it, Daddy. I can use the toilet, bathe myself, and sleep on my own. I can even cook!”</p><p>Her reply left Su Shengjing shocked.</p><p><em>Did she need to take care of herself in the orphanage because she was having a tough time there? </em></p><p><em>She even knows how to cook at such a young age! </em></p><p></p><p></p><p>“Daddy, I know a lot of things. I won’t make you worry.” Su Jiu added.</p><p>When Su Shengjing heard her, he felt like a rock had been placed on his heart. He then stroked her tiny head.</p><p>Su Jiu rubbed her head against his palm, and Su Shengjing’s heart softened again. Suddenly, someone beside them loudly exclaimed, “Ah! She’s so cute! Hi, is this your daughter? How adorable!”</p><p>Blinking her eyes, Su Jiu looked at the person. It was a fashionable and pretty lady who looked to be around twenty. When she saw Su Jiu, her eyes sparkled, and she asked Su Shengjing with a look of anticipation.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Su Shengjing coughed and said in an unnatural way, “Yes. She’s my daughter.”</p><p>“She doesn’t look like you at all!”</p><p>Su Shengjing was left speechless.</p><p>Somehow, he felt offended.</p><p><em>Don’t daughters look like their fathers? Why did she say that Su Jiu doesn’t look like me? </em></p><p>Su Shengjing did not realize how miserable his appearance was right now—he completely looked like an uncle! In contrast, his daughter was so adorable and soft that one would feel compelled to squeeze her cheeks. They looked nothing alike.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The lady excitedly stroked Su Jiu’s tiny head. The kid’s hair was furry and nice to touch, so she could not help but pat her a bit longer while mumbling, “How cute! How adorable!”</p><p>Su Shengjing did not really like it when others touched Su Jiu. With a frown, he said, “That’s enough.”</p><p>The lady withdrew her hand and stuck her tongue out in embarrassment. “Sorry, Uncle. Your daughter’s so cute that I can’t help myself.”</p><p><em>Uncle? </em></p><p>Su Shengjing’s lips twitched. <em>I’m only twenty-two! She must be blind to think that I’m an uncle! </em></p><p>Humphing, he pushed the trolley and continued walking forward. Then, he grabbed two cans of powdered milk, a baby bottle, and some children’s toiletries and clothes. Whenever he saw something suitable for Su Jiu, he wanted to shove it into the trolley. However, since his wallet was almost empty, he could only buy the items he urgently needed first.</p><p>In the end, he took some fresh fruits, vegetables, beef, and half a chicken. When he thought that he had taken everything he needed, he walked toward the cashier.</p><p>When they reached the cashier, Su Jiu reached out and helped Su Shengjing place the groceries on the cashier counter.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The cashier sneaked a few more glances at Su Jiu. She had never seen such an adorable girl, who looked like those child stars on the milk advertisements— No, Su Jiu was even better-looking than them!</p><p>After paying for the groceries, Su Shengjing carried the bags and took Su Jiu out of the trolley. He firmly hugged her in his arms, then strode out like an impressive father.</p><p>When Su Jiu saw how he was carrying a bunch of things, she said, “Daddy, I can walk on my own and help you carry some stuff.”</p><p><em>This child is too obedient!</em></p><p>As Su Shengjing exclaimed in his heart, he continued carrying her. He said while walking, “I can carry them. Plus, there are a lot of people here. It’s better to carry you around.”</p><p>At that moment, the lady whom they had met at the toiletries section had also come out after buying her groceries. When she saw this scene, she immediately turned on her phone camera and snapped a picture of the two.</p>'),(96,5,'Chapter 12 The Villain 1',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 12: The Villain 1</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Atlas Studios  <strong>Editor: </strong>Atlas Studios</p><p>The lady wanted to take a picture of Su Jiu and share it with her friends. After all, they would definitely want to have a child after seeing it. However, Su Jiu turned her head around at that moment, and the lady’s phone could only capture the back of Su Jiu’s round head that held two tiny, tied braids.</p><p>However, even the back of her head looked extremely adorable!</p><p></p><p></p><p>The lady’s motherly instincts took over her.

With his popularity having reached rock bottom, nothing would happen even if someone posted something about him on the internet.</p><p>When he reached home, he had Su Jiu wash her hands. Then, he grabbed a towel and cleaned her face for her.</p><p>Su Jiu’s fair and tender face was as smooth as tofu, and her eyes were big and bright.

You’re the best! I like you the most!”</p><p>These words made Su Shengjing elated. He stroked her tiny head, carried her, and sat her down on the sofa.

He gave her a cup since she did not want to drink from the baby bottle.</p><p>After taking the cup, the hungry Su Jiu immediately gulped down the milk.

Even though he had not taken care of children in the past, he was glad that he hadn’t become too flustered. <em>I’m not so useless after all, ain’t I? </em></p><p>As he thought about it, Su Shengjing felt motivated.

He waved at her and called her over.</p><p>Su Jiu obediently sat at the edge of the bed and placed her hands on her lap like a primary school kid. She waited for Su Shengjing to dry her hair.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Su Shengjing plugged in the hairdryer. His lean fingers lifted Su Jiu’s shoulder-length hair as he blew at her hair. He deliberately distanced himself from her so that she would not feel the heat from the hairdryer.</p><p>Su Jiu turned her head around and spotted a photo frame on the bedside table. It displayed a picture of when Su Shengjing was younger.</p>'),(107,5,'Chapter 23 Give Daddy a Makeover 1',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Chapter 23: Give Daddy a Makeover 1</h2><p></p><p>In the photo, he had been attending a commercial activity. Dressed in a black suit, he stood tall on the red carpet while smiling at the cameras.</p><p>As a guy in his early twenties, he was transitioning from a boy to a man. His eyes still had a hint of youthfulness in them, but his face was so handsome that it could make one scream.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Su Jiu innocently asked, “Daddy, is this you? How handsome!”</p><p>Su Shengjing looked at the photo; it was from a time when his appearance had been at his best. He embarrassedly replied, “Yeah.”</p><p>Su Jiu said in a child-like voice, “Daddy, you look so good in the picture without such long hair and your mustache. I think you should cut your hair and shave your mustache!”</p><p>That was a simple thing she had asked. Su Shengjing did not want his mustache to prick Su Jiu anymore either, so he agreed, “Okay, I’ll shave my mustache and cut my hair tomorrow.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>He had decided to groom himself well and look for a job instead of wasting his days away. In the past, when he used to work part-time at small shops, he could barely sustain himself. Since he had a child now and his expenses would be higher, it was better and more reliable to look for a formal job.</p><p>Although he could live in an unpolished manner, a little girl could not live like that!</p><p>***</p><p>The next morning, Su Shengjing went to the toilet after waking up and completely shaved away his mustache.</p><p></p><p></p><p>After he had shaved, he felt like he had become a few years younger. It was like his youth had returned.</p><p>He stroked his smooth skin in satisfaction. Then, he walked out of the toilet and went toward the room Su Jiu was in.</p><p>His house was very small with an area of around twenty square meters. As there was only one bedroom, Su Shengjing had Su Jiu sleep on the bed, while he slept on the sofa. He had initially been worried that she would fall off the bed. However, she was obediently lying in the middle of the bed with her hands crossed over the pillow.</p><p><em>She looks so obedient even when she’s sleeping.</em></p><p>Su Jiu had yet to wake up, and her dense eyelashes cast a faint shadow below her eyes. Her face looked as cute as a doll, and it made Su Shengjing want to poke her cheek.</p><p>He then actually extended his hand and lightly poked Su Jiu’s face. Her face was very soft and bouncy, and he could not help but poke it again.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Sensing something, the little girl sleepily said, “Daddy…”</p><p>“Are you awake?” Su Shengjing spoke as he carried her up.</p><p>He was sensitive to smell, yet the child’s milk-like fragrance did not put him off at all.</p><p>Su Jiu let him hug her. She leaned against his shoulder and rubbed her sleepy eyes. “Why are you up so early today?”</p><p>“Because I agreed to cut my hair today. Accompany me, okay?”</p><p>“Okay!” Su Jiu immediately got excited and looked forward to her father’s new appearance.</p><p>However, this was not enough.</p><p>She patted Su Shengjing’s stomach. “Daddy, if you want to become handsome, we need to remove this fat.

Just call him your father from now on and live with him!”</p><p>After speaking, he placed Su Jiu back on the bed. He was about to leave when Su Jiu hurriedly pulled his arm and laughed. “Daddy, I’m lying to you! I like you the most. I don’t want anyone else to be my father.”</p><p>Su Shengjing stopped in his tracks. His fury immediately disappeared when he listened to her cute voice.</p><p>Turning around, he saw her cunningly smile as if her prank had succeeded. He now knew for sure that she was lying to him.</p><p></p><p></p><p>“You brat! You know how to lie, huh?” Although Su Shengjing was gritting his teeth, he could not bear to act fierce toward or hit Su Jiu. Hence, he just reached his hands out and tickled her.</p><p>Su Jiu rolled around on the bed and laughed. “Daddy, Daddy!”</p><p>Her cute laughter softened Su Shengjing’s heart, and he stopped.</p><p>After catching her breath, Su Jiu pouted and looked at him. She seriously said, “Daddy, if you don’t have all this fat, you’ll be more handsome than that uncle!”</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Really?” Su Shengjing suddenly fell into deep thought.</p><p><em>Is it time for me to go to the gym and get back those chest muscles, abdominal muscles, and biceps from the past?

I don’t want you to be fatty.”</p><p>As he looked at the anticipation in her eyes, Su Shengjing had no choice but to say, “Alright. I’ll destroy all the fat on my body.”</p><p>Su Jiu secretly chuckled. The first step in giving her father a makeover had started! She was looking forward to the result.</p><p>***</p><p></p><p></p><p>After a simple breakfast, Su Shengjing walked out of the house with Su Jiu. There was a barber shop near the block. When they reached the shop, Su Jiu unexpectedly saw the future villain.</p><p>The skinny boy was standing in front of the bun shop. As he looked at the steaming buns, he swallowed his saliva and touched his empty pocket. He just stood there without taking a step forward.</p><p>Suddenly, a middle-aged woman walked past him and roughly pushed him to the side. He quickly regained his balance and did not fall. However, he merely glanced at her and left without saying anything.</p><p>Before he left, he shot a longing look at those buns.</p><p>Su Shengjing observed everything. When she thought about his miserable fate in the future, she felt a sense of pity. Tugging Su Shengjing’s sleeve, she raised her head and said, “Daddy, that’s the boy collecting trash the other day. He must have not eaten anything. Should we buy some buns for him?”</p><p>Su Shengjing was speechless.</p><p>Although he was poor and in no position to help others, he could not dismiss his daughter’s kind intentions. A few buns weren’t that expensive either. Hence, he nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll buy them now.”</p><p>Rong Si had not eaten from the previous day’s noon till this morning. He was starving, but his mother’s illness had relapsed and she could not work; they did not even have money to buy rice. Hence, he had no choice but to collect trash. This was the only way he could earn money at his age.</p><p></p><p></p><p>He had walked for a distance when a child-like voice rang behind him. “Wait up!”</p><p>The voice sounded familiar. Rong Si subconsciously turned around and saw Su Shengjing walking over while carrying Su Jiu.</p><p>Su Jiu was holding a bag of steaming meat buns. She passed it to him and said, “This is for you!”</p><p>Rong Si pursed his lips. He hesitated, and instead of taking the buns, he looked at her.</p><p>Su Jiu shot him a smile that was as sweet as the strawberry-flavored candy he had eaten.</p>'),(109,5,'Chapter 25 Give Daddy a Makeover 3',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Chapter 25: Give Daddy a Makeover 3</h2><p></p><p>Su Jiu passed the buns to him again. “Just take it. If you don’t want them, Daddy and I will be unhappy.”</p><p>Stretching his arm out, Rong Si took the buns. He pursed his lips and muttered, “Thank you.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>This surprised Su Shengjing a little. “You can speak? So you aren’t mute.”</p><p>When Su Jiu saw that Rong Si’s expression seemed strange, she instantly pouted and clarified to Su Shengjing. “Daddy, he’s not mute. He just doesn’t like to speak.”</p><p>Rong Si was stunned.</p><p><em>Is she explaining on my behalf?</em></p><p></p><p></p><p>When Rong Si had moved here with his mother, she had told him to be polite and build a good rapport with the aunties, uncles, and children in the block. However, whenever others saw him, they would call him an illegitimate bastard, claiming that he was born because his mother slept with a random man. They even said that his mother was a prostitute.</p><p>Some ugly and disgusting uncles even asked him with a smile about how much his mother cost a night. They even said, “I’ll help your mother give birth to a little brother or sister for you, okay?”</p><p>Rong Si did not understand why they said that. Whenever he went out with his mother and met the aunties, they would point at them behind their backs and say, “Did you see her? She’s that prostitute. I wonder how many men she has slept with. How shameless! Do you think that she has some disease?”</p><p>“Haha! She looks average. The bastard at home even said that she’s pretty!”</p><p></p><p></p><p>“No matter how pretty she is, she’s still a prostitute who society looks down upon. In the past, she would’ve been imprisoned and drowned!”</p><p>He had curiously asked her then, “Mommy, why are they calling you a prostitute? Why did they ask me how much it cost to sleep with you?”</p><p>Rong Si’s mother had been shocked at first, then she had turned pale and silent. She had simply hugged him and silently cried.</p><p>After a while, she had sobbed and said, “Be obedient and don’t listen to what they say. Just pretend like they don’t exist. We’ll just go about with our lives, okay?”</p><p>Ever since then, even if these people kept mocking and teasing him and his mother, Rong Si ignored them. As he instinctively felt disgusted when he saw them, he would just walk away.</p><p>Gradually, these people lost interest in him and said that he was mute. The children did not want to play with him either. Whenever they saw him, they would make faces, throw pebbles at him, and call him an illegitimate bastard like the other adults.</p><p></p><p></p><p>However, this little girl did not look at him with a disgusted gaze. Not only did she act favorable toward him, but she also asked her father to give him money. This time, she even bought buns for him.</p><p>Rong Si’s mother had told him that he must know to be grateful. He decided that after growing up, he would definitely repay this little girl.</p><p>At this moment, the fat woman who had finished buying her buns spotted Su Shengjing when she squeezed across the crowd. When she saw that he was hugging a three-year-old girl with the infamous illegitimate child standing in front of him, she immediately felt disdainful. She deliberately walked over and sarcastically said, “Oh my! You little bastard! Are you here to buy buns too?</p><p>“My daughter told me that the netizens have been discussing you recently. They said that you have become a father. By the way, where did you get this child from? Is it true that you don’t know who her mother is and that she did not want to raise your daughter?”</p><p>The woman gloatingly looked at Su Jiu. “Did your mother run away with another guy and abandon you?”</p><p>This fat woman was called Madam Zhang, and she was notorious for having a sharp tongue. When Rong Si saw her, his dark eyes immediately became hostile.</p><p>She was the one who kept saying bad things about his mother, making her cry every time she returned home after leaving the house.</p><p>Although Rong Si’s mother did not say anything to him, he knew that those people must have said bad things about her.</p><p></p><p></p>'),(110,6,'Chapter 1 The Qiao Family Has a Fake Family Member',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 1: The Qiao Family Has a Fake Family Member</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Atlas Studios  <strong>Editor: </strong>Atlas Studios</p><p>Rao City’s weather in June was like a stove. The scorching sun created layers of heatwaves on the asphalt road. It was so hot that no one was seen on the streets.</p><p>Qiao Nian came out of the room dragging her newly packed luggage.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She could already hear Qiao Chen’s chatter before she was downstairs.</p><p>“Mom and Dad, are Qiao Nian’s biological parents really coming to pick her up?</p><p>Father Qiao sternly replied, “It’s none of your business. Are you done practicing for the piano piece you’re performing later? Your Grandmother’s friend will be coming from Beijing. She’s a Humanities Professor and a National Pianist. If you perform well, and with the help of your grandmother, your application to a university in Beijing will be settled.”</p><p>“I have been practicing.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Before Qiao Nian headed down, she heard Qiao Chen whining again.</p><p>“Dad, what do you think Sister’s biological parents look like?”</p><p>She innocently rambled on. “Her biological parents said they were coming the day before, yet they’re only arriving today! Could it be that they took a train from a ravine to come here?”</p><p>Qiao Nian couldn’t help but pause in her footsteps, feeling insulted.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Three months ago, she unknowingly found out that her dear sister Qiao Chen and her boyfriend were having an intimate relationship and cheating on her.</p><p>She couldn’t hold back her anger and exposed the matter, only to find out that she wasn’t part of the Qiao Family but just a foster child that they adopted from the orphanage.</p><p>The Qiao Family didn’t adopt her because they wanted to do a good deed.</p><p>It was because Qiao Chen was born with a rare blood disease. Other than taking medications, she also required blood transfusions every month.</p><p>The Qiao Family ran a company that was successfully listed last year, so they were considered well-known in Rao City. If Qiao Chen’s illness could be treated with money, it would save the Qiao Family from trouble.</p><p>Unfortunately, other than being born with illness, Qiao Chen also had the rare RH blood type. Only one in 100,000 would inherit such a blood type.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Because it was so rare, hospitals called this blood type the Panda blood.</p><p>It meant that it was more precious than a panda.</p><p>The Qiao Family had the financial capability, but it wasn’t certain that the hospital would have enough blood for Qiao Chen every month. Thus, the Qiao Family came up with the idea of adopting a child with a matching blood type from an orphanage to act as a blood bag for Qiao Chen.</p><p>She was that free blood bag.</p><p>From a young age, Qiao Nian had been taught to be a good sister by giving the pretty clothes and the awards to her younger sister. If it wasn’t for the matter between Qiao Chen and Fu Ge, she would still be kept in the dark.</p><p>The Qiao Family told her about it only because Qiao Chen had almost fully recovered after receiving the treatment in the past years and no longer required medication or blood transfusion.</p><p>She was of no use anymore. Grandma Qiao was also so upset that she blew up the matter between Qiao Chen and Fu Ge at Qiao Chen’s birthday party, so they exposed her identity in front of everyone to save Qiao Chen and the Qiao Family’s reputation.</p><p>Father Qiao didn’t want to talk about Qiao Nian. “Stop talking.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Chen replied defiantly, “I’m not wrong.

She was wearing a light blue T-shirt with a red and white striped flannel. The hem casually tucked into her denim shorts, revealing a pair of fair and slim legs.</p><p>Everyone in the family had a fair complexion, but Qiao Nian was even fairer.</p><p>Due to how fair she was, Qiao Nian’s eyes seemed extra dark. When he looked at her, Qiao Weimin always felt a sense of distance from her.</p><p>It was probably because she wasn’t his biological daughter.</p><p>“Nian Nian, are you done packing your stuff?” Father Qiao asked her gently. After all, they had raised her for more than 10 years.</p><p>Qiao Nian came down with her light luggage and nodded.</p><p>When Qiao Chen saw her, she immediately acted as if nothing happened and shouted, “Sister.”</p><p>Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered to reply to her and walked past her directly.</p><p>Qiao Chen was upset by being ignored by Qiao Nian. She looked down pouting, her pale face as delicate as white flowers in the wind.</p><p>Witnessing this, He Yujuan’s face darkened. Holding her crutches, she scolded. “Chen Chen is talking to you, can’t you hear?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Chen immediately took her hand, shook her head, and tried to put in a good word for her. “Grandma, it’s fine. Sister isn’t in a good mood. I’m alright.”</p><p>Hearing what she said, He Yujuan’s impression of Qiao Nian became worse, she spoke to her in disgust. “It’s no doubt you aren’t a child of the Qiao Family. You still can’t get rid of the pettiness after so many years.”</p><p>“Mom.”</p><p>Qiao Weiming pleaded. He then walked towards Qiao Nian and handed her a card. “Here’s 10,000 yuan.”</p><p>He sighed and insisted that Qiao Nian take it. “Take it! When you go back, you have to be obedient. Use it to buy some clothes. In the future, you may need it for your studies too.”</p><p>He had always been careful. This was a critical period for the Qiao Family as they just received a development project from the government. It was best not to create unnecessary problems.</p><p>He once investigated Qiao Nian’s biological parents.

Since Dad already gave it to you, just take it. P-Perhaps… you’ll need it in the future…”</p><p>She didn’t make herself clear, but Qiao Nian knew what she was getting at. Qiao Nian glanced at her coldly.</p><p>Qiao Chen gave her an elegant smile in return.

You’re too sensitive. We’ve lived together for over 10 years. Even though you’ve found your biological parents, you’re still my sister. We hope that you’ll live well in the future too.

At this point, her cell phone rang. She placed the bank card that Qiao Weimin had given her on the table and then looked at the phone screen. She then said to the Qiao family members, “My family is here, I’ll leave first.”</p><p>He Yujuan scoffed as she watched Qiao Nian leave. She remarked sarcastically, “Hmph, what an ingrate! You’ve raised her for over 10 years and she didn’t even bother thanking you before leaving.”</p><p>“Grandma, Sister is perhaps too excited to see her biological parents,” Qiao Chen said gently.</p><p>Too bad, Qiao Nian’s biological parents were just peasants who couldn’t even enter their villa. What a joke!</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Sister said she only took her notebook with her, but her bag looked so packed and heavy.

Let her take whatever she wants with her. We don’t need that kind of money, anyway.”</p><p>He Yujuan supported herself with her walking stick as she watched the figure disappear into the distance.

He had eyes that were more charming than Jiang Li’s and was wearing a black V-neck t-shirt under his white coat. Part of his chest was revealed, as well as a silver chain around his neck.

He grumbled, “I’m your boyfriend no matter what, do you have to be so heartless?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Nian corrected him, “Ex-boyfriend!”</p><p>Wei Lou didn’t care about that. “Ex-boyfriend is still a boyfriend! You’ve broken up with Fu Ge for a long time anyway, and I’ve been a spare tire all this while. Won’t you consider making me official?”</p><p>He joked a lot usually, and Qiao Nian sometimes couldn’t tell if he was joking or being serious.

What are they like?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Qiao Nian recalled and then said, “I didn’t interact with them, so I’m not sure. I only saw my biological father.

Qiao Weimin told me that they’re from Luohe County, but it seems like they actually aren’t.”</p><p>“What’s your biological father’s name?”</p><p>Qiao Nian thought about it but couldn’t recall. She didn’t quite like this sort of “interrogation”. She replied, “… His last name is Jiang.”</p><p>“Jiang?”</p><p>There was a huge Jiang household in Rao City that had come a long way.

She’d saved him before, and he’d helped her.</p><p>It wasn’t a matter of life and death, but she had complete trust in Wei Lou anyway. He was also one of the very few who knew her identity.</p><p>Wei Lou agreed right away. Ever since this medicine appeared in the black market, Qiao Nian’s reputation as a Miracle Doctor had spread far and wide. He had had to deal with this several times before.

Jiang Li’s appearance was so outstanding that he couldn’t help but take another look.</p><p>He seemed to have seen his face on TV before. He was a star and seemed quite famous!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Why was a star at Rao City’s hospital?</p><p>Could it be that a show was being filmed here?</p><p>…</p><p>At the staircase.</p><p>Ye Wangchuan went to the ward to check on Ye Qichen, who was now out of danger but still unconscious. After calling Qiao Nian for a long time and yet not seeing her come up, he had no choice but to come down to find her.</p><p>His eyes fell on the drenched and fragile-looking girl.</p><p>“Why didn’t you answer the phone?”</p><p>Too lazy to explain her encounter with the Qiao family, Qiao Nian replied casually, “My phone is on silent mode. I didn’t see your call.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ye Wangchuan saw that her phone was still vibrating out of the corner of his eye, and also noticed her silently hanging up. However, he didn’t expose her lie.</p><p>He reached out to pull her. “Let’s go, Grandpa Jiang and the others are waiting for you.”</p><p>Qiao Nian avoided his hand agilely with a depressed expression.</p><p>Jiang Li must have called them!</p><p>Her neck was just a little scratched, what was there to alert everyone about!</p><p>She was about to go up when she was suddenly blocked in a corner.</p><p>Ye Wangchuan’s tall figure cast a shadow that shrouded her like a mountain.</p><p>The invisible strength and pressure coming from him made Qiao Nian’s goosebumps stand.</p><p>“You’re not calling me brother?”</p><p>His voice was sexy and sultry!</p><p>It took her breath away!</p><p>What was he saying!</p><p>Qiao Nian raised her head questioningly, staring into his vast and deep eyes. Bloodthirsty hostility was suppressed under his dark eyes as he stared at her as if sucking her in.</p><p></p><p></p><p>“I’ll take you up.”</p><p>He forcefully held her hand, his thin lips pursed into a slight smile. He was wanton and unbridled, and his big hand completely wrapped her hand as if he wouldn’t allow her to break free.</p><p>Then, he gathered his seductive aura and returned to looking lazy and indifferent. “Let’s go.”</p>');

Your Second Aunt and your sister can’t make it today. Are you alright?”</p><p>Old Master Jiang and Jiang Zongjin were the most anxious. Old Master was so worried, his hair was in a mess and his bright eyes had never left Qiao Nian.</p><p>“Come over, let Grandpa have a look at you. Jiang Li said you were drowning, I really had a shock. Are you alright?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jiang Zongjin was a nerd and also the most honest person amongst them. He was straightforward about what he thought. “If you encounter such an incident again, don’t ever put yourself at risk. Your safety is the most important!”</p><p>“Brother.”</p><p>Jiang Zongnan looked at his brother with a wry smile. The person his niece rescued was the descendant of the Ye family. Moreover, Young Master Ye was here too. Did he have to say it so plainly?</p><p>But he understood his brother’s love for his own daughter.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It took them many efforts to finally find Qiao Nian and bring her home. If anything untoward happened to her, the family would be in chaos!</p><p>The Jiang family wasn’t as wealthy as the Ye family. But even so, they didn’t have to sacrifice their flesh and blood to earn a favor from the Yes.</p><p>Old Master Jiang and Jiang Zongjin pulled Qiao Nian closer to have a look at her. Their heart ached when they saw the scratch on her neck inflicted by the child.</p><p>“Look, the scratch is pretty deep. Why didn’t Jiang Li send you to the hospital earlier? It’s such a warm day and you were drenched. What if your wound gets infected?” Old Master Jiang sounded as if he was blaming Jiang Li, but deep down, his heart just went out to Qiao Nian.</p><p>Qiao Nian touched her neck. She wasn’t used to having so many people around her. “It’s just a small wound, it won’t get infected.”</p><p>Old Master Jiang shot her a glance but couldn’t bear to say anything about her. He got the Head of the Dermatology department to have a look.</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Director Tan, I’ll have to trouble you to take a look at the wound on my granddaughter’s neck.”</p><p>“Elder Jiang, you’re too civil!” The doctor seemed a little flustered. There were so many people around, even the Director of the hospital would feel pressurized. He didn’t feel deserving of a “Director” title, considering he was just the Head of a small department.</p><p>“Miss Qiao, come, please take a seat.” He quickly got Qiao Nian to sit and then used a flashlight to examine her neck.</p><p>The girl’s neck was extremely fair, almost as white as milk. That was why the wound seemed especially serious.</p><p>As a dermatology specialist, this sort of injury wasn’t a big deal to him. But with so many pairs of eyes on him right now, he couldn’t help but break out in a sweat.</p><p>He’d already checked it with his flashlight, but he still took his magnifying glass to have a closer look just in case. He only looked up and took his glasses off when he was sure that the wound only had a very mild case of inflammation from being soaked in the river water.</p><p>He said to the people around, “There isn’t a big problem with Miss Qiao’s wound, but it’s slightly inflamed as it got wet. I’ll give her some anti-inflammation cream. The nurse will clean her wound with alcohol, and it’ll be fine when she applies the cream after that.”</p><p>Old Master Jiang was still worried. “Do you need to examine her further? Maybe take a CT scan?”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Father Jiang was worried too. “Nian Nian landed in the water, who knows if she might’ve knocked herself somewhere or the other. It might be better to get a CT scan.”</p><p>Jiang Zongnan immediately said, “I’ll get Jiang Li to arrange for that.”</p><p>Qiao Nian was speechless.</p><p>But the doctor repeated time and again that she was fine and did not require a CT scan. He explained that the CT scan itself was harmful to the body and it was best not to do it unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>The Jiang family eventually accepted his explanation and decided against the CT scan.</p><p>They got Jiang Li to accompany Qiao Nian to get her wound cleaned.</p>'),(135,7,'Chapter 1  The servant who sweeps',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>A new day begins, and Kai Yang woke up. He cleaned up and took the broom lying in the corner of the small room and walked out. Standing at the front door, he stretched a little. He looked up at the touch of grey in the dawn sky and closed his eyes while breathing in deeply. He was enjoying this moment of peace, before reopening his eyes to start sweeping the ground, cleaning away the dirt and leaves.</p><p>Dressed in black clothes that were simple and clean. The aged clothing colour for no reason, highlighted the youth’s loneliness and years of isolation here. Kai Yang’s spine was as straight as a javelin, and with his face had a meticulous expression. Even though he was completing the lowest ranked job. His actions were very calm, he didn’t exert much force on the broom, his body didn’t even move that much. With only the rotation of his wrist, the broom moved effortlessly. When his body moved, the dust and trash on the ground seemed to magically accumulate in one place around him, just like they had grown a pair feet.</p><p>Kai Yang was the Sky Tower’s experimental disciple. For three he had trained in the school, but he had only reached the tempered body third stage. Yet the other disciples that had entered at the same time as him had long surpassed him and reached higher stages. They were all able to enter into the main building, pay their respects and make advances towards their futures. While he can only lament about his inadequacy in the outer courts.</p><p>The tempered body third stage in three years cannot be called bad or good, but really, really mediocre.</p><p>Helplessly, Kai Yang could only continue to sweep out here in the outer court. Working hard to support himself and working hard in training.</p><p>Sky Tower School is a very unique school. This uniqueness is seen through the ruthless competition between disciples. In the school, the strong are like kings, while the weak are eliminated. The strong eat the weak; the law of the jungle, in the Sky Tower School is actively followed by all.</p><p>In other schools you may be able to school friendly competition, brotherly bonds and people working together to achieve the same goal. But in the Sky Tower school, you will only be able to false bonds, in order to use each other and rise in power. Stepping over each other’s bodies is the only way.</p><p>Under Sky Tower’s strict system, it’s well-known throughout the entire Han Dynasty. Although the grounds were not that large, but due to the brutal nature of their disciples, their might is second to none! This is also because, each disciples’ skill is like a tiger and walking out, no one in all the rivers and lakes dares to provoke them.</p><p>Though the Sky Tower School has one rule. That’s to fourteen year old disciples, the first three years of their acceptance is considered the testing phase. In these three years, all of the disciples food, clothing, shelter are provided by the outer court. Disciples only need to focus on cultivating. If in these three years you can breakthrough the tempered body, then you are able to enter the inner court to pay respects to your elders and become their students. Of course you don’t need to have a teacher and practise on your own, but the difference in learning by yourself and having a teacher is very large. In a way, the Sky Tower rules do have some flexibility and freedom.</p><p>In those three years if you don’t break through, then you can either leave the school or be demoted to an experimental disciple.</p><p>Experimental disciple is Kai Yang’s current status! He is also Sky Tower School’s shame!</p><p>Compared to normal disciples, their treatment is very different. Experimental disciples must provide for their food, shelter, clothing, for the outer court will no longer waste cultivating resources on these trashes. Once demoted to experimental disciples, you basically can never advance. Unless you manage to increase your cultivation level quickly. Only then will the school let you attempt to become a true disciple.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>The entire Sky Tower consists of three thousand disciples, while the experimental disciples? You can count them on your ten fingers! Kai Yang has faith that he can become a true disciple!</p><p>For experimental disciples who want to survive in Sky Tower, is like wanting to reach the heavens. Take Kai Yang for example, the current hut that he is living in was built by him, one log at a time. The holes on the small roof, he doesn’t even have time to fix them. When it rains, the water can’t exit properly and builds up in the room. He buys his own clothes, his food he got himself, he is responsible for all his own needs.</p><p>Kai Yang’s small hut is in the school’s most remote and most uninhabited location. </p><p>Generally with such horrendous treatment, it is difficult to endure. That is the reason why the school only has a very small number of these disciples. Most who couldn’t breakthrough the tempered body chose to leave, but Kai Yang stayed.</p><p>Already been kicked out, how is ok?</p><p>A few months before, when he was made a experimental disciple, Kai Yang accepted a sweeping job to provide for himself.</p><p>Right now Kai Yang was both an experimental disciple and the tower’s little sweeping servant. But just by sweeping to maintain a living is hard. There are times when he is cold or hungry, in this life he had chosen this path. Even so, he didn’t play the drums of retreat, because in this this life he had chosen this oath and must continue down it. That was what men did.</p><p>In Kai Yang there was toughness, if you don’t hit into the brick wall, then don’t look back type of toughness!</p><p>(TLN: Chinese idiom, to continue on with your own decision/idea/plan)</p><p>The sky gradually began to light up as he swept. Cleaning the trails, sweeping dust from the space.</p><p>Even though sweeping itself didn’t use a lot of energy, but without food or drink since the morning and constantly moving, Kai Yang was covered in sweat. This had nothing to do with strength, by his physique was very poor. Two out of three meals he was hungry. For anybody living like him, how could their physique be good.</p><p>Gradually Sky Tower disciples surrounded him. These disciples had woke up early, not to cultivate but to look at him. They had great interest in Kai Yang, looking at him with avid gazes like they were staring at a naked beauty. A sweet fragrance like juicy meat bins wafted.</p><p>Among those Tower disciples gathered around Kai Yang, there was also a tense competitive atmosphere in the air. Looking at each other warily, all held an unfriendly look.</p><p>Someone in the crowd softly said: “So many people, it’s a bit excessive ah.”</p><p>It was that moment they said: “Do you think anybody can walk this path huh. Nobody wants you to stay.”</p><p>That statement made the person who spoke embarrassed. For everybody body knew why they were gathered hey, why they were all looking at Kai Yang, all waiting for that moment to come. The deadline was about to arrive, leaving now was not a pity? If you can grab the funds, and today it is also a harvest.</p><p>The commotion next to him, Kai Yang naturally knew, though his expression never changed. They will parade themselves every five days, six times a month. He has already gotten used to it, nothing to make a fuss out of. He also noticed the amount of people in front of him had decreased, they probably had not all arrived yet. </p><p>(TIN: Wow, these guys are really bothered to come there six times a month. Don’t they have better things to do?)</p><p>As he was being discredited, he turned a blind eye to the people next to him and began to sweep.</p><p>Following the passage of time, the people around Kai Yang gradually increased. There was roughly thirty-forty people present.</p><p>Kai Yang suddenly stopped and sat down in the middle of the road. Slowly he breathed in the early morning air to restore his own physical stamina.</p><p>At this movement, the people gathered around him all spread out and surrounded him, with Kai Yang as the centre. A tense atmosphere filled the air, it was as if the air no longer flowed.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>No one looked at each other pleasingly, but all looked intensely at Kai Yang. </p><p>If people were to see this crowd, they would hold the misunderstanding that expert was in the middle. Or else, how could so many people surround one person like that? In reality, Kai Yang was only a experimental disciple with a tempered body, third stage. Any of the people present, were stronger than him.</p><p>“Kai Yang, no need to bother. Why don’t you just obediently lie down on the ground so I can beat you and save some time?” Seeing him like this, they really held disdain.</p><p>How much energy can a tempered body third stage restore? You are going to lose anyway, so why linger?</p><p>“Hear, Hear. Kai Yang, please think about our fellow disciples feelings too. We are not like you, after this game we need to go practise.”</p><p>The statement was to let Kai Yang quickly submit and let them beat him. Making the act of restoring his internal energy disrespectful to them. Though he just turned a deaf ear, like Buddha Lao.</p><p>Time continued to pass by, suddenly the melodious Tower bells sounded. It reached the ears of all the disciples surrounding Kai Yang and himself, startling the disciples. The bells tolled nine times, and from the east the sun rose. It was a new day! Everyone’s breathing calmed down, helplessly looking at Kai Yang as he slowly got up. He took up his broom and glanced at the people encircling him.</p><p>“Choose me Senior Yang!” Shouted a person. “I strike lightly, I can guarantee you no pain!”</p><p>“Rubbish! Choose me, I will be merciful. I will end it in one fist, and I promise not to waste everyone’s time.”</p><p>“Pick me……”</p><p>“Pick me…….”</p><p>It was very clamorous, just like in a marketplace where vendors were trying to sell their produce and competing on whose produce was fresher.</p><p>“Kai Yang, you can choose your own opponent!” Someone reminded.</p><p>Kai Yang chuckled, readily he lifted his broom and threw it to the sky. The dozens of pairs of eyes looked up, full of expectation, waited for the broom to fall whilst praying: “choose me, choose me!” Time seemed to slow down, the broom turned a few times in the air and immediately fell on the ground with a loud boom, no longer moving. </p><p>The broom head pointed into the crowd to a burly teenager. A regretful sound, the crowd full of resentment and resignation. But that burly youngster laughed out loud and rushed out: “Fellow disciples, this brother won this battle today, but hopes fellow disciple do not blame me.”</p><p>“Che, lucky bastard!” One jealously said.</p><p>“Why couldn’t it choose me, for I come every five days, for a month! Kai Yang you aren’t doing this on purpose are you?”</p><p>“Don’t mention it, I have already come for a full three months and not once was I chosen!”</p><p>“Brother, you are more miserable than me.”</p><p>“Not miserable, not miserable, watching a good good show.” The two brothers looked at each other, smiling secretly to in their hearts.</p><p>In the courtyard, the others had already dispersed, leaving only Kai Yang and the burly teenager looking at each other.</p><p>“Experimental disciple Kai Yang, tempered body third stage!” Yang Kai introduced to his opponent.</p><p>“Ordinary disciple Zhou Ding Jun, tempered body fifth stage!” The burly teenager introduced.</p><p>Sky Tower disciples were also ranked. From bottom to top are the ordinary disciples, lower base disciples, elite disciples, and core disciple; the five ranks. Zhou Ding Jun said that he was an ordinary disciple, that means he has yet to pay his respects and doesn’t have a mentor. If the breakthrough of the tempered body disciple had a mentor, then their status would be higher than those ordinary lower base disciples. And those elite disciple were selected from the best lower base disciples.</p><p>As for the core disciples, they were treated as the hope of the next generation of the Sky Tower School and thus cultivated accordingly.</p><p>The awe-inspiring disciple hierarchy, though it seems unreasonable it can stimulate the younger generation into the fierce sense of competition, which is the foundation of the brutal Tower regime. This is the main reason why Kai Yang fought countless people, another rule of Sky Tower, the Challenge Rule.</p><p></p>'),(136,7,'Chapter 2  Breaking through the wall and not looking back',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In the school there was one rule: All Sky Tower disciples were allowed to be challenged once every five days. Though they could at most be three levels higher, or they were allowed to decline. The winner then be able to gain contribution points, while the loser will have points deducted.</p><p>Contribution Points are also known as Main Gate Contribution Points!</p><p>In the Sky Tower, contribution points are equivalent to money. If you have enough contribution points, you could exchange them for anything you want, cheats, weapons from the Main Gate Logistics Department. Points can also be exchanged for gold and silver, but generally speaking these contributions were hard-won, and the disciples were generally reluctant to exchange it for that.</p><p>There were also many different ways to obtain these points. You can exchange them through the treasure hunt, completing tasks, etc.</p><p>The most common way to earn contribution points was to challenge others! The duels were to test their strength against other disciples, and if they won they earned contribution points.</p><p>So early in the morning and many people crowded around Kai Yang, it was like staring a ripe persimmon about to fall.</p><p>Kai Yang’s name, in the school could be considered famous. Not only because he carried the identity of a trial disciple, but also because he was still in Sky Terrace. Also every time someone challenged him, he lost.</p><p>Kai Yang naturally remembered what it the commotion was, today is the fifth day from the last challenge. They who didn’t challenge him previously, could now. Who isn’t jealous? It was basically free contribution points. Although the points gained were not large, it was still enticing, thus many people still came.</p><p>In position, Kai Yang shouted out two words, “Please instruct!”</p><p>That being said, anyone knew that Kai Yang was in for another beating!</p><p>Kai Yang was always the first to attack. Even with his thin body he would always put out an amazing fight, taking the step to Zhou Ding Jun, then punched to the chest. Afterwards a simple and direct attack, then a tiger fist, his attacks were strong and it felt like all of his energy were in his attacks.</p><p>In the school, all disciples had to learn the Shaolin Fist. This fist was well-known, a basic move to keep disciples in shape and start them off.</p><p>Zhou Ding Jun didn’t panic, because he was stronger than his opponent by two levels. Sadly, this battle didn’t hold any suspense. Kai Yang’s fist was seen coming and easily dodged by that burly body.</p><p>Grazing past his clothes, Zhou Ding was unharmed. Punching again, Kai Yang was easily countered and hit in his solar plexus.</p><p>Suppressing the pain, Kai Yang quickly retreated and avoided Zhou Ding’s third strike.</p><p>“Eh?” This surprised Zhou Ding, he hadn’t thought that his tird stage brother, could actually react fast enough. With this, his future plans were disrupted.</p><p>But this small error didn’t affect the situation. Thinking quickly, Zhou Ding took to the occasion to catch Kai Yang unaware.</p><p>Unaware, Kai Yang suddenly kicked his right foot forward. Seeing the shadow rapidly approaching, Zhou Ding saw his indomitable spirit, whilst executing a Shaolin fist.</p><p>Crap! He heart jumped. Although he had higher cultivation, he was inferior to Kai Yang’s battle experience.</p><p>But what would it matter? Even if he couldn’t dodge, he would take it head on.</p><p>Two light chuckles were heard, then Kai Yang fell backwards, while Zhou Ding was still standing. If his opponent was at the same cultivation as him, the he would have been the one to fall down. </p><p>Others couldn’t see the fists, but they clearly felt it. This disciple was too fast, so in other words he first hit himself then the opponent.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>But, it was only his fist that was powerful. This body and health were all too frail, skinny arms, legs and body. Malnutrition was very obvious, thus resulting in this ending.</p><p>“Senior, you let me win!” This battle left quite a bitter result in Zhou Ding Jun’s heart. Although he won, he didn’t feel as if he had won.</p><p>To the side, many whispers could be heard: “This person thought he won?”</p><p>“Ha ha. Doesn’t that mean he didn’t know of Kai Yang’s reputation and challenged him? ”</p><p>“This is really too hilarious.”</p><p>Zhou Ding furrowed his brow, for really didn’t know of Kai Yang’s reputation. He had heard people talking about him. So today when he saw many people crowding around, he had decided to participate too and was super lucky to be chosen.</p><p>Could you not win? His own fist made him go flying, thus making him at a supreme disadvantage. According to the gate rules, he had already lost.</p><p>“Again!” After this thought, Kai Yang yet stood up again and without the slightest hesitation but with even more intense spirit.</p><p>Without waiting for answer, Kai Yang charged over. Three feet away, he swept his foot towards Zhou Ding’s legs in an attempt to topple him.</p><p>A leg whip! The school had disciples cultivate various martials arts. Yet Kai Yang’s application of them far surpassed his peers, even though he knew less techniques.</p><p>So you could use a leg whip here.</p><p>Then without notice, Kai Yang went flying away again.</p><p>With two realms apart, also the gap between physical fitness, Kai Yang was once again defeated. His attack to Zhou Ding’s leg had clearly wounded his own bones, making him falter slightly.</p><p>“Again!” He said while clenching his teeth and eyes full of determination.</p><p>“Peng…….” Kai Yang flew away again.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>“Peng…….” Kai Yang flew away again.</p><p>For those who couldn’t watch any longer had left, while the ones who stayed marvelled: “Kai Yang, this guy had real tenacity. No matter how many times he’s beaten down, he just gets back up. He won’t let it go!”</p><p>(TLN: ~Let it go~! Let it go~o! Sorry had to do that. :P)</p><p>Hearing these words, Zhou Ding felt real bitter. He hadn’t imagined that his opponent was such a crazy person.</p><p>So Kai Yang was sent flying another seven or eight times. His face was swollen, eyes were black, staggering around and breathing quite heavily. But he still continued to persist and continue fighting.</p><p>Finally Zhou Ding exclaimed: “Are you crazy? Throw down the towel or you’ll die!”</p><p></p>'),(137,7,'Chapter 3  147 Losses',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Within the Tower disciples’ internal struggles, every year there are many who die. Zhou Ding Jun seeing this unflinching and courageous brother, couldn’t help but feel a bit alarmed.</p><p>When he thought that, Zhou Ding Jun knew he couldn’t reach such a degree and was afraid that he would have to surrender.</p><p>Keep your cool, will then you will not be afraid to be burned. This is the way of life, to stubbornly follow your decision. This is perseverance!</p><p>Despite Kai Yang’s sorry figure, his eyes were becoming more and more powerful. Zhou Ding Jun knew that if he didn’t settle things now, then there will be no end.</p><p>Thinking of this, Zhou Ding Jun rushed forward to execute a palm knife to Kai Yang’s neck bone. Kai Yang with an imposing manner swiftly escaped. Then his eyes clouded and he fell limply to the ground.</p><p>Seeing this scene, tens of feet higher, a disciple who was sitting on a tree branch took out a small book. Flipping the page she wrote: Trial Disciple Kai Yang vs. Ordinary Disciple Zhou Ding Jun, Zhou Ding Jun wins.</p><p>(TLN: Experimental disciple will now become trial disciple)</p><p>The person who was on the tree branch had a graceful figure, it obviously was a woman. It was just that black mask on her face, didn’t allow people to see her face. But those delicate eyebrows, proved that this person was not old. The armband on her arm also indicated her identity, a Sky Tower Dark Hall Disciple!</p><p>Sky Tower’s Dark Hall is a special sector; the school’s three main elders were responsible for governing and the hall disciples were responsible for to recording down all affairs of the school, no matter how big or small, all matters are recorded. This also included the results of duels between disciples.</p><p>So for all battles within the school, you do not have to worry about not being able to prove your wins and earning contribution points. For in the shadows, dark hall disciples will record them down for you, and summarise your monthly records.</p><p>This woman, after recording the outcome for this duel, took out another smaller book from her waist and opened up at May 7th century, 14 years Kai Yang’s 147th defeat.</p><p>Even if you remove this, above are numerous records of Kai Yang’s battles. From the first battle to the most recent, all had one word: Defeat!</p><p>One hundred and forty seven battles in a row, he had lost every single one of them. This simply can be said that since the school’s history, it was a unique record and was enough to be awe-inspiring. Though the owner of this record was lying on the ground, not knowing if they were dead or alive.</p><p>Kai Yang had never challenged others, so these 147 losses were from others challenging him. So to say, from being challenged once every five day, this had last for two years.</p><p>Looking at Kai Yang on the ground, she wrinkled her eyebrows. She didn’t understand how Yang kai could endure to this state. He had already become the Tower’s trial disciple, even his very survival was endangered, so why did he still linger? If he had left, then his life will certainly be better. This thin boy, what kind of dedication did he have? Even with 147 straight losses, he remains undaunted.</p><p>Perhaps this is a man’s folly? Taking notice of Kai Yang was also a moment’s coincidence. When Xia Ning Chang became a dark hall disciple, she was placed in charge of monitoring this area. Yang Kai was challenged every time, not once, not twice, and every single time she saw him being beaten to near death. Xia Ning Chang, began to pay attention to this tempered body third stage youth.</p><p>She was really curious, with his strength, how long could he endure before finally leaving Sky Tower. This type of talent, this type of training speed, he really was not fit to remain here. The ordinary world is his place.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>The people below had already long scattered, only Kai Yang was still there on the ground. Coming and going, time passed by.</p><p>Xia Ning Chang, disappeared from the branch in a flash.</p><p>When Kai Yang woke up, it was already three o’clock. There was nowhere on his body that didn’t hurt. Staggering, he stood up and looked up, only to be surprised. For the place in which he woke up from was under the shade of a tree and not where he fainted.</p><p>This was really surprising, was there a fellow disciple that was kind enough to carry him over? This had never happened before, causing Kai Yang to furrow his brows. He could vaguely remember there was a shadowy figure darting in front of him. But memory was too vague, thinking harder just made it more unclear.</p><p>But between his current position and the place he fainted, there was very distinct drag marks, clearly showing that he had been dragged over.</p><p>Once again he felt his back, immediately flaring hot pain spread out.</p><p>Kai Yang froze for a moment, becoming furious! The trace of goodwill he felt towards his benefactor had quickly disappeared. That person directly dragged him over, otherwise how could his back bled like this.</p><p>He might as just have left him there on the ground! Kai Yang thought to himself.</p><p>Being depressed, Kai Yang realised that in his right hand he was clutching something. Looking down in doubt, he was surprised to find a small, fine work of porcelain in his hand.</p><p>What is this? This was definitely not his, for the only things that Kai Yang owned were the clothes on his back and his broom. How could he have this?</p><p>The small porcelain bottle had a label. Yang Kau read it out: “Blood Clotting Cream”.</p><p>Blood clotting cream, Kai Yang knew of this.</p><p>This was the school’s cream to help heal wounds, although it was ordinary, its effects were very good. Generally, disciples will carry one bottle around for emergency uses. this one bottle of cream in Sky Tower Logistics,was very expensive.</p><p>Ten points of contribution was the bottle’s cost!</p><p>How much contribution points can Kai Yang earn for sweeping for a month? He can only earn ten points, in other words, this one bottle’s worth was equal to one month of work for him.</p><p>Who was it? At this moment, the resentment Kai Yang had towards this person was reduced greatly, but as he moved, the pain flared up again. He had already come to this Tower for three years, three years. Within this time, Yang Kai had already gotten used to the lack of compassion between disciples. But today, for this person to leave behind a bottle of blood clotting cream for him, greatly touched Yang Kai’s hearts.</p><p>Originally, he had thought all the disciples were cold-blooded people.</p><p>Perhaps this bottle of cream was not worth much to them, but to Kai Yang currently, he desperately needed it.</p><p>There was a saying, dripping water is grace, is hard to forget even when one’s teeth fall out!</p><p>(TLN: Meaning one small kindness must be remembered eternally and returned)</p><p>Kai Yang was both grateful and tried to remember who it was. It was becoming harder to remember. He could could only recall the thin strand of fragrance lingering around.</p><p>“Was this medicine this fragrant?” Kai Yang pondered.</p><p>Calming down and straightening his clothes, he carefully put the bottle away. Kai Yang re-picked up his broom and commenced his work.</p><p>Inside and outside all were swept, then at midnight, his work was considered completed. Kai Yang dragged his tired and hungry body back to his hut.</p><p>The morning’s battle wounds had yet to be treated. Even when Kai Yang was starving, he could only endure. First treat the injuries then deal with the hunger.</p><p>Taking off his clothes, he then carried over a tub of water to wash his body. If someone were to be by his side and look at Kai Yang’s body, they would cry out in shock.</p><p>Kai Yang’s bones, along with his ribs were all clearly visible. It was clear that his body didn’t have much flesh on it and lacked nutrition. There were also bruises and scars littering his body everywhere. There was practically no place that wasn’t scarred.</p><p>Every five days he was challenged, every time he lost, every time he was knocked unconscious. When old injuries had yet to fade, new ones were added. Switching to any other person, they would be unable to tolerate this pain, but Kai Yang did. Not only did he bear with it, but he continued his daily sweeping, not letting those injuries affect him.</p><p></p>'),(138,7,'Chapter 4  The Black Book',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Once his body was clean, Kai Yang picked up the bottle of blood clotting cream and sniffed it a little. He found that the medicine was quite refreshing and lost himself in it and then he shook his to clear it.</p><p>Kai Yang opened that bottle, and tried to smear the cream directly onto his injuries but stopped. He hastily went to fetch a new tub of water and then put some of the medicine into the water to dilute it. Stirring carefully, he began his treatment using the diluted formula.</p><p>(TLN: Ah, the life of a poor person. Too relatable…T_T)</p><p>Enough the effects of the blood clotting cream were good, after diluting it, the effects were also reduced. But Kai Yang only had this one bottle, so naturally he would have to use it sparingly.</p><p>After the tub of diluted was used up, Kai Yang had also finished treating his injuries. However, it also left him some doubts. For the paste’s smell was not the same as it was previously and also slightly spicy. </p><p>Putting his clothes back on, he went to get the dark coloured sweet potato and wolfed it down. Kai Yang then plonked down on his bed, and soon fell asleep.</p><p>The holes in the small roof, allowed some light to seep in, lighting up the hut. The hut was extremely sparse, there was no table or chairs. Only one small bed with a deerskin blanket and square shaped pillow. This was all of Kai Yang’s possessions.</p><p>The deerskin, was from a deer Kai Yang hunted previously. Although it was not thick, it was still warm. While his pillow was from his time outside the school when he was hunting, he happened to pick up.</p><p>Pillow was a square, a foot long and three fingers thick. It looked like stone, felt like one but didn’t bear the weight a stone should. Kai Yang didn’t know what it was, but used it as a pillow, and didn’t investigate further.</p><p>This blackstone pillow had already been with Kai Yang for a year already, yet he still didn’t know what it was. Nonetheless, it was a great pillow.</p><p>Fast asleep, Kai Yang dreamt of today’s battle. Time and time again he was hit flying away by Zhou Ding Jun. And time and time again he would stand back up, persevering and continuing with a blood crest on his chest.</p><p>As the dream continues the blood crest became more and more powerful. Kai Yang’s sleeping face was clench up in pain, but you could see it was resolute. He only had one goal in his heart; to succeed. Even if he was ordered to cut off his foot or fry his body in flames, he would not cower in fear.</p><p>The unconscious Kai Yang didn’t take notice that the pillow below his had started to exclude a clouded light that corresponded with his moods. This light became more and more luminous.</p><p>In the dream, Kai Yang continued with his early morning encounter with Zhou Ding Jun; repeatedly getting knocked to the ground. At his thousandth time of getting knocked and getting back up, with his unwavering will suddenly broke through. He rushed mercilessly towards Zhou Ding Jun, who immediately fell to the ground. Zhou Ding Jun’s figure then became hazy and morphed into his own figure.</p><p>At this moment Kai Yang’s mind calmed down, though it wasn’t due to him beating his opponent, but he winning against himself. Winning against his inner fear and yielding heart.</p><p>A faint feeling gradually rose up, there is no longer anything under the sky that can make him submit to them.</p><p>In reality, the black pillow under Kai Yang’s head suddenly burst forth a black ray. This black ray emerged from the black stone and hovered in the air for a bit before drilling into Yang Kai’s head. Instantly disappearing from sight.</p><p>At the same time, in an ancient and desolate place a strange presence descended. Like tidal waves, the collapse of snow, any person in front of him was insignificant that strange presence thought.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>Kai Yang suddenly opened his eyes, his whole body sweating and bursting with fear.</p><p>He was awoken by that strange presence.</p><p>Calming himself, he forced a smile. When was dreaming, he could actually scare himself like that, it’s ridiculous. Rubbing his face, he looked up into the night sky to determine the time, and was annoyed. He had only slept for two hours, seeing it was quite dark outside.</p><p>Hurriedly he got up, folded up the deerskin blanket and re-positioned the blackstone pillow. As he got up, he frowned and turned to look back at the pillow.</p><p>This feeling……his gut told him that it was not the same.</p><p>Under doubts, Kai Yang reached out towards the pillow and picked it up. He was correct, its weight had decreased a lot.</p><p>Strange, how can this block stone, suddenly become so light? Questioning this, more questions started to appear.</p><p>It was like a thick book was being thrown into the air, with the pages spread out as it landed. Kai Yang was flabbergasted, momentarily forgetting to catch it.</p><p>Pa, the blackstone pillow fell to the ground and opened up like a book. He couldn’t believe it, even though it was spread out in front of him.</p><p>Wasn’t this a stone? How could it suddenly turn into a book?</p><p>The Blackstone pillow had been with Kai Yang for over a year already, he was very clear. Did he not previously find a blackstone and not a book? Did an old turtle take off his shell and become a snake?</p><p>A while ago when he stooped down to pick up the book, and he immediately felt a connection with it.</p><p>Looking at it again, he really had to admit it was the pillow he was using. This thick book, left him speechless, though there were no words. It was empty. But the books pages couldn’t let him see through it. He gently tried to tear a page, but he couldn’t tear it at all.</p><p>It really makes him rethink. He had owned it for an entire year, and only just discovered its true colours.</p><p>But such an empty black book, what is its use? He inspected the book all over, and still nothing.</p><p>Mysterious. Kai Yang turned to the first page, and nothing. Staring at the blank book page.</p><p>With little effort, he still found little change to the page. Then he discovered there was a little change to the page. The strange presence that appeared in the desolate place of his dreamed had appeared again. A line of golden coloured characters had started to appear.</p><p>“Blood is cited, the golden body descends, not a miracle, but a golden immortal!”</p><p>This penetrated deep into the soul, which caused Kai Yang to slam the book shut, with his limbs shaking uncontrollably. Breathing deeply, he managed to calm his heart down a bit. </p><p>What secrets did this black book hide? He didn’t know at all, but he knew that this object he obtained from Black Wind Mountains contains great history.</p><p>After a long period of silence, he once again opened the black book. This time, he read the first line on the page.</p><p>Turns out………it wasn’t a dream.</p><p>Gradually, other lines slowly appeared.</p><p>“Proud golden body, rules the fence, indomitable spirit, will it descend!”</p><p>Eight lines and thirty-two words occupied an entire page. Giving one a dominating heavenly and earthly feeling, as if those words were imbued with domineering spirit.</p><p></p>'),(139,7,'Chapter 5  The Proud Golden Statue',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>These thirty-two words’ meanings were very easy to understand. Naturally Kai Yang understood.</p><p>But the black book’s history was unclear, thus he was a bit afraid. What if this was a trap of some sort? Thinking of this he laughed at himself, for currently he was only a trials disciple of Sky Tower’s. Who would go to the effort of taking care of him?</p><p>From just looking at the last couple of lines and their meaning, the reason why the blackstone pillow will turn into a black book was probably because of his dream tonight.</p><p>For over one year, the pillow didn’t change, then suddenly after that dream it turned into a book. They must be connected.</p><p>Is it because of his own change that also changed the blackstone pillow.</p><p>Since it was I who led to the book’s birth, then this black book was born for me! Thus, I am this black book’s owner!</p><p>Thinking of this, Kai Yang hesitated no more. The writing clearly on the book clearly states that he must drip blood in order to lead. Thinking of this, he bit onto his finger hardly and dripped a drop of blood on to the page.</p><p>Drip, drip. The blood went onto the page, but there was no apparent change. After a fair amount of time passed, from the page, black light started to emerge. His body immediately felt unwell, for the injuries from earlier today had started to sear in pain. His head had also started to hurt.</p><p>Biting down on his teeth, he continued to endure. His blood continued to flow, and the light on the book was becoming brighter and brighter.</p><p>After a large amount of time and effort, Kai Yang nearly fainted. But there had been substantial change to the book, and the black light had started to wiggle and contract. And from the center of the page, a tiny vortex had appeared.</p><p>Following that, from within the vortex a golden swirl could be seen. Kai Yang put great effort to maintain a clear mind, staring intently to the transformation in front of him.</p><p>Within the black vortex, a small, round, shiny, black object gradually came out.</p><p>He was shocked, for there really was something in the the book. Even though while he was dripping his blood, he had some expectations, he didn’t think that is was actually true.</p><p>But right now, right in front of him, the thirty-words from before were not false. </p><p>Blood is cited, the golden body descends!</p><p>So, what kind of golden body is it? Anticipation covered his pale face.</p><p>After a while, after the shiny, round thing had fully appeared in front of him, he couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva. How matter how rich his imagination was, he wouldn’t have thought that the golden body would be like this.</p><p>This thing was about 30 cm high golden skeleton, and to think the first thing that came out was this skeleton’s skull. The golden skull just floated on top of the book page, sitting crossed legged like it was mediating. Every bone lighting up Kai Yang’s tiny hut.</p><p>The black vortex on the page slowly began to recede and everything reverted back to its tranquil state.</p><p>Kai Yang had watched this strange golden skull appeared, for a time did not know how to react. On page said only how to get the golden body out, but didn’t say what to do after it came out.</p><p>Looking at it, he thought there wasn’t something right. The golden skeleton in front of him had no eyes, but he felt like it looked like his own. It obviously didn’t have any mouth but was clearly mocking its weakness.</p><p>Thinking of this, Kai Yang was furious and went to pick it up.</p><p>This small, insignificant skeleton dares to be arrogant!</p><p>He didn’t think that when he went to reach out for it, the golden skeleton flew out towards him. Flying past his hand and embedded himself on his chest.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>This was a bit of a horror. With a skeleton smashing onto his chest, he cried out and then the skeleton started to emit a fluorescent light, and penetrated deep into the pores of Kai Yang’s limbs.</p><p>Suddenly, pain exploded all over his body, but the pain was not an ordinary pain, but the pain from the depths of the bone! He breathed in painfully, fell to the ground, his body bent like shrimp, with waves of cramps.</p><p>His whole body’s bones shattered in that moment, and he couldn’t even lift a finger, for he had no strength. This was not an illusion, if you could see into his body, then you can see his bones being crushed, and next to each crushed bone, there was a layer of gold wrapped around. Continuously repairing the broken bones, but far slower than the damage speed. When the repair was finished, it was crushed again.</p><p>Human bones wrap around bone marrow and bone marrow nerve. Any small touch to them can bring great harm. One can only imagine his suffering at that moment.</p><p>In his body, not a single bone wasn’t shattered.</p><p>Even for others, even if their strength of thousands of times higher than his, they would have probably fainted now. But with Kai Yang, he could only feel the pain a thousand fold right now.</p><p>Tragic cry came from the hut, not far away a fellow disciple was out for a walk was frightened by the cry and quickly ran away.</p><p>Form somewhere, he received a message that came from this golden body: Destroy Kai Yang’s consciousness, and seize his body!</p><p>Did Kai Yang agree? Even if he was unable to move, but also struggled to maintain the awareness, he will never let golden body take over the magpie nest. The golden body felt fear, so over and over again crushed Yang Kai’s bones, tortured his nerves, so that he fainted thereon.</p><p>One is a proud golden statue, another with an indomitable spirit, who wins who loses, one cannot see the outcome.</p><p>Kai Yang knew that right now it was really important, unlike the previous challenges with his fellow disciples. If this was the past him, then he would have given up but now he will not. Even if it hurts like hell will endure.</p><p>His consciousness, the golden body’s destructive power, both commenced a hard tug of war. And the battlefield is the Kai Yang’s body, you pull, I pull, each not letting an inch go.</p><p>Over time, Kai Yang was surprised to find that the intolerable pain was slowly reducing, help lift his spirits and fill him full of energy.</p><p>It’s no wonder, after Kai Yang and the golden body clashed time and time again, the numerous crushing of his bones had strengthened them. With his bones becoming stronger and stronger, and the golden body’s powers becoming weaker and weaker, the pain thus naturally alleviated. The struggle will soon end.</p><p>With the scales tipping in his favor, the unbearable pain slowly became bearable. Transforming into light tickles, then becoming like splashes of cold water. This feeling was like applying cream, allowing his millions of pores to open and relax.</p><p>Aware of the golden body’s desperate struggle, made Kai Yang furious. Cursing loudly, he crushed that presence within him.</p><p>Inside his body, it had finally calmed down.</p><p>A sigh could be heard, a sigh full of comfort and trace of great relief.</p><p></p>'),(140,7,'Chapter 6  BMWs are a good ride and beauties go to heroes',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>He after quietly lying on the ground for more than an hour, Kai Yang stood up, for he had just used up all his strength.</p><p>An hour before, Kai Yang felt it was like a dream. He really could not believe this was true.</p><p>Quietly he punched himself and felt the pain.</p><p>“In the end what it is, what history does this black book have?” He muttered to himself in helplessness.</p><p>Waiting until his heart stopped beating, he suddenly found himself somewhat different from before. For he couldn’t eat three, fulfilling meals a day, and every five days he would suffer beatings. Thus his body bones are weak, but now he clearly perceived that his bones were full of vitality. A surge of energy, filled with warmth, slowly circulated inside and outside, his body.</p><p>Moving slightly, the bones burst out a crystal-clear sound. Making it seem like a melody being played. And he who was hurt today, couldn’t feel the pain anymore.</p><p>Aware of this, Kai Yang quickly roll up his sleeves, and opened his clothes. Looking closely, he found that his body no longer had any bruises and injuries. They had actually all disappear, even those old wounds were healed.</p><p>Feeling as unblemished as a newborn baby!</p><p>Rubbing the places that previously held wounds, dead skin fell. This revealed the new tender skin underneath, like a baby’s but far more healthier.</p><p>“I cry ……” He swallowed down a cold lump, thinking of that golden skeleton in his body had such a strong recovery ability!</p><p>Then feeling his own strength and found that he was still at the tempered body third stage with no change. This discovery somewhat made him a little disappointed.</p><p>Rivers and allusions, with secrets known only to insiders, this type of story Kai Yang heard much during his childhood. He knew in world there are many men eligible to jump past the dragon gate, becoming powerful and famous.</p><p>But after all it’s just a story. How many people can really be happy and gain such luck and results in this world? Those senior experts with greater strength, the more I could not bear to lower themselves with earth and buried. Always finding inheritor before death. I want to jump off a cliff drill a cave and encounter events, such unlikely things will happen?</p><p>But the current problem had happened to him. That black must have great background, and that old golden skeleton must be extraordinary.</p><p>This can be said as his good fortune. It could also be said as fate.</p><p>The four sentences on the black book’s first page: Proud golden body, rules the fence, indomitable spirit, will it descend!</p><p>If he didn’t pick up the black book, but another picked it up, they too will treat it was garbage. Unable to prise open like Mt. Tai. Precisely because he picked it up, and used it as a pillow for a year, it felt his body’s unyielding and tough nature. Unlocking the of the secret black book today.</p><p>In other words, this thing really is his first encounter, but it’s the first achievement that he obtained through his own hands. Thought of this, Kai Yang sudden burst comfortable, is called the BMW with a good saddle, beauty gifts hero</p><p>……</p><p>“That black book.” Thinking of it suddenly, this book that was his pillow for over year. He wasn’t anxious to find out what it was nor how he found it.</p><p>Between being anxious, and somewhat weakened in the body, the black book abruptly appeared in front of Kai Yang, and snapped shut, falling to the ground.</p><p>He was stunned. Picking up the book, he furrowed his eyebrows while thinking hard. Struck by with an idea, a move from his hands the book disappeared. And a further move, made it appear again.</p><p>This scene was like a magic trick. One could see that Kai Yang’s face was very solemn, because he truly felt, that the black book could escape into his body with a single thought.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>“This black book possibly……be made from a soulstone!” After saying it, he nearly gave himself a fright.</p><p>A soulstone! This was considered a legendary gem.</p><p>Only when hundreds of millions of ghost gather in the abyss and with the help of vast amounts of human vitality, will it start to form.</p><p>Rumor has it, that this is how is was formed.</p><p>Inside the blackstone, with misery of a hundred million lives, the living cannot enter, and green grass can’t think to grow!</p><p>Those words were somewhat exaggerated. But for a soulstone about 3.5cm x 3.5 cm to form, how many lives must be taken? The formation of this mythical rock was really cruel and bloody. What every life near it during its creation, will be dead within milliseconds.</p><p>Also the formation time is unimaginable, it could that up to a millennium or even ten millenniums.</p><p>Putting the formation process aside, this soulstone can be considered a supreme treasure. That is because it has a very unique ability, for it can be melded with one’s body and also open up a dimension. This space is quite flexible, storing things will be no hassle.</p><p>Even though Kai Yang is only a trial disciple, a humble position, his experiences were not lacking. Not to mention, the story of the legendary soulstone has been around more many years, anyone would know the story.</p><p>When he just obtained this black book, he didn’t think about this. Thinking about how the books went into his body, he thought about how the golden skeleton came out from the book. How could he not recognise the book’s material?</p><p>He immediately started sweating.</p><p>Soulstones were the things of legends, long extinct in the world. He didn’t think that he will be able to encounter one, let alone such a large one!</p><p>The legends only talked about 3.5cm x 3.5 cm sized soulstones, for it was only found that large. Even at that size, it was priceless. But the only in front of him, was somehow made into a black book, that was 30 x 7 cm!</p><p>It’s value……was immeasurable!</p><p>If this news were to spread out, even if it’s the entire Han Dynasty, not mention a mere martial school, they will probably be crushed overnight to obtain it.</p><p>Kai Yang couldn’t help but feel his hands heat up. This heart had not forgotten the terror, but luckily it could be taken into his body. Otherwise he would be in great danger.</p><p>His body hiding this treasure, he swiftly escaped back into his hut. He dared not to be carelessly, while his heart beated madly.</p><p>He was becoming more and more excited, whilst also becoming more and more uneasy.</p><p>HIs strength was currently too low, so how could he guard this treasure? Even though the black book could be taken into his body, eliminating chances of being discovered. This didn’t lessen the worry in his heart.</p><p>Only practise, only the strong will be able to protect what is theirs! Thinking about what happened three years ago, Kai Yang’s eyes gradually calmed down.</p><p>All on his, without any support he came to this school. What is not for practise and strength?</p><p>Even though he obtained this book, he took it into his hands. On the first page was the proud Golden Body. Even though he didn’t know what use it had, it couldn’t be useless. This book also had so many pages, it couldn’t only possess this one Golden Body?</p><p></p>'),(141,7,'Chapter 7  Breaking through stages is like being reborn',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Although Kai Yang is only fifteen this year, due to his experiences these past three years, he is far more mature than his peers. It is also because of this, that he forged this unyielding character. </p><p>So when he calmed down, sitting on his bed he carefully started to read the first page.</p><p>After confirming there were no extra things popping out of the first page, he started to read the second page. </p><p>With his previous experiences, his actions seemed more natural and knowledgeable. And then Kai Yang’s eyes slowly widened as golden words emerged on the dark pages</p><p> “Proud Golden Body: Tempered Body Record!”</p><p>Previously his mood had dropped but now it soared. Sure enough, as he suspected, every page had something hidden</p><p> Almost without thinking, Kai Yang’s entire mind was focused on the second page of the book.</p><p>Abruptly, the golden characters flew off the pages like a fish and swiftly drilled themselves in Kai Yang’s brain. The glow enveloped the darkness around him and then disappeared. After it was gone, he felt as if his brain had gained new information. This had all come from the golden characters.</p><p>Calming his heart, Kai Yang closed his eyes and began to digest the information.</p><p>In fact, he didn’t need to digest and absorb the information. For when the characters imprinted themselves into his brain, he was already able to comprehend their meaning with ease. A full mastery in another sense.</p><p>“This is the tempered body record.” Yang Kai muttered, for he found that it was a fist technique.</p><p>Though it may seem simple, in reality it was not. In order to perform it, there were strict requirements. For it is extremely profound. In order to cultivate it, you must be facing the rising sun, in the east, to learn it.</p><p>So at most, you could only practise for half an hour a day.</p><p>Currently it was night, so he had to wait at least five-six hours to start. This frustrated Kai Yang, for he had exerted himself all day and only ate one measly sweet potato. Nonetheless, he had obtained a priceless treasure, and was jubilant.</p><p>Aftering trying to sleep for half an hour, he decided to analyse the third page of the black book.</p><p>But it just let him down, no matter how much he checked and flipped, there were no changes to the page. While doing this, he fell asleep.</p><p>When Yang Kai then woke up, it was nearly sunrise. The pre-dawn darkness was clouded and stillness covered the whole area, with the occasional insect and bird noises.</p><p>With his heart looking forward to what was going to happen, Kai Yang quickly leapt out of bed, and went to the front of the cabin. Standing there, he took a few deep breaths and let his body slowly relax.</p><p>Oriental? A touch of gray dawn appeared, then he opened his eyes. The set of instructions on the fist technique was practised countless, hundreds of times.</p><p>His hands shaped into a palm. With a gentle, slow movement, pushing to the left, to the right, pushing forward. Embracing the world in his mind, everything in between the palm, the vast land, even the air covering the moon and stars.</p><p>Left foot forward, right next to the horizon, the right foot stepped powerfully like the king of the underworld. Between breaths, the world full was full of vitality, like spring flowers blooming.</p><p>The autumn wind blew, like a golden message. Then the cold wind whistled by, signalling the coming of snow, ice, cold snow.</p><p>Yang Kai’s look gradually deepened, slowly his fists pressed on the hefty rocks. In any case, the rock didn’t hint at opening any time soon.</p><p>With a burst of sound, Kai Yang with a pale face, suddenly staggered, nearly fell to his knees.</p><p>While exercising countless times in his mind, he discovered that this art was an absolute fist. Kai Yang never expected this record actually contained such mysterious quenching body technique.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>For just that short while, Kai Yang felt that the entire world was weighing on his shoulders. But he also felt that he could sense all things in the world, under this pressure.</p><p>This quenching body record, was not the practise of fist techniques. It was the practise of worldly transformation and the fate of the world. This practice was full of ups and downs, joys and sorrows. A slow punch and kick in, could affect the power of heaven and earth, but also was full of secret rules.</p><p>When he launched a six palms, it took three steps. This result wasn’t even one percent of the result recorded in the book. Just that, had been difficult to sustain. Then a crack emitted from his spine, making him believe that he broke his spine.</p><p>He Quickly inspected it, but only found that his back was in some pain. It wasn’t anything big.</p><p>Steeling his mind, Kai Yang once again started to practise according to the tempered body record.</p><p>Because he wasn’t psychologically prepared, Kai Yang‘s mind was in a trance. Feeling unclear, he held his breath to regain a clear mind. Accompanied by a slow dance of his fists, Kai Yang once again felt his mind had become clear and regained the atmosphere required to continue.</p><p>Then his body emitted several indistinct feelings, Kai Yang was uncertain as to what they were. Not only that, with the routine deployment, his fist was actually heavier, like being at the bottom of the ocean. With more hardships, there were more improvements.</p><p>Kaka sounds could be heard. Kai Yang’s every action, made his bones explode like firecrackers. Excruciating pain permeated throughout his body, but he was unmoved. His tenacity at this moment vividly appeared.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Kai Yang felt his hands and feet tremble like they were beaten to pulp. It was like heaven and earth both imposed themselves on his body.</p><p>Persisting, he didn’t falter.</p><p>Suddenly a warmth surged, alleviating the pain within his body in this moment. Spirits lifted, he restarted practise. He knew that this must have been due to the integration of the golden skeleton. After all, both of these things came from the same place.</p><p>In front the sun rising, near a cabin in a remote place of the school stood a sweating young man. Diligently practising, slow fists and discovering his future.</p><p>Half an hour passed when Kai Yang suddenly felt light. He no longer felt the heavy pressure on his body. Right at this moment, he could no longer continuing cultivating this skill.</p><p>The record was very clear, you could only cultivate for half an hour everyday at sunrise.</p><p>His effort seemed to have drained him. Thus Kai Yang fell to the ground in a heap and took a deep breath. A surge of purple gas accompanied his breath and disappeared. In an instant, he felt refreshed and energised.</p><p>Looking distracted, he couldn’t help but but be shocked.</p><p>Atmosphere sense! He had already developed a sense to the atmosphere. That is to say, he had broken through the tempered body third stage and was entering the fourth stage?</p><p>This news made him elated. Since entering Sky Tower, it took three years of practicing to reach the third stage. But after thirty minutes of practising, the mysterious quenching body technique had let him break through and enter the fourth stage.</p><p>The tempered body had nine stages. Until the third stage, it really just enhanced one’s physical capabilities. But after the fourth stage, it would generate a presence within the meridians.</p><p>Only with the birth of atmosphere sense, are you considered a true cultivator.</p><p>Although at this time you will have the atmosphere sense, the body will still have no real strength.

Kai Yang previously had experienced this, but never at this level.</p><p>Numerous ideas and joy lingered in his mind. Although he had successfully entered the fourth layer, he had made no real progress in the tempered body record’s fist technique.

Even though it wasn’t thorough, he could no longer be like how he had been, taking each step as it came. For after awhile, you couldn’t help but become impatient.</p><p>Then after eating something he continued to sweep the area.</p><p>Although he was a sweeper, it didn’t mean that he needed to sweep the entire school. He was only responsible for one tenth of the school. Even though it was cumbersome, it would only take an hour or so.</p><p>Within the trees, Xia Ning Chang had started to monitor the disciples and inadvertently saw Kai Yang sweeping away. To not have some emotions would be weird. Today, there was something different about him, but she wasn’t sure. For over half an hour, he hadn’t left that spot, sweeping it until it was shiny and spotless. It was so slick that if a mosquito were to go on, it would have a sprained ankle.</p><p>(TLN: Trying to express how clean it is. This author has a major issue with mosquitos I say.)</p><p>This guy……..Xia Ning Chang didn’t know what to do with him.</p><p>At that moment, Kai Yang was thinking about other things. Yesterday he had obtained a huge opportunity, so naturally he was considering his future. But no real options were found. He could only continue to practise at sunrise everyday, for now.</p><p>While he was pondering, rapid footsteps approached quickly from behind. He quickly went to dodge, but didn’t realise that the other party was making preparations to avoid him too. So they crashed into each other.</p><p>Though he didn’t sustain any major injuries, when he crashed into that person, it felt as if he had crashed into a steel wall. With a cry, he fell to the ground and the place he bumped felt numb.</p><p>Kai Yang quickly recovered and apologetically asked: “This fellow disciple, are you okay?”</p><p>The young man was annoyed and when he looked up to see that it was Kai Yang, that explosive anger dissipated. Holding anger for such person held no meaning and it was also his own fault.</p><p>Replying immediately while waving his hands: “It’s alright, it’s alright!”</p><p>While saying this and getting up, he then energetically ran away.</p><p>Kai Yang asked: “Fellow disciple, where are you going to hurriedly?”</p><p>The young man faintly shouted: “The Contribution Hall, where else?”</p><p>Listening to his words, Kai Yang realised that today was already the eighth day of the month. It was the day where the main gate distributed last month’s contribution points!</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>So every month of this day, the Logistics Department would be crowded with disciples flocking to collect their points. With these points they could exchange them for various cultivation pills, treasures and martial arts to improve their strength. So this day made all disciples all excited.</p><p>Some were excited, while others disappointed. Kai Yang was of the latter.</p><p>Startled, he couldn’t help but frown. Each month, the amount of points he received was quite meager.</p><p>Sweepers could earn ten points, but in the last month he was challenged six times, and each time he lost! With reductions after each loss, he was only left with four points.</p><p>This……this really made people cry.</p><p>Fortunately he was only a trial disciple. His status was the lowest, so if he lost, he would only lose one point. Normal disciples lost two!</p><p>Thinking of this, Kai Yang was thankful.</p><p>But even a small mosquito has flesh. And with his savings, he will one day earn enough to exchange them for something worthwhile.</p><p>(TLN: Again, what does the author have with mosquitos?)</p><p>There had been enough delay today he thought as he continued to sweep.</p><p>When he had finally finished the job, it was noon. Time to go to the hall to collect his points.</p><p>After the morning’s bustle, the hall was now deserted and quiet. Thankfully he hadn’t came in the morning, or the wait would have been too troublesome.</p><p>Waltzing into the hall, you could clearly see an old man dozing away.</p><p>This old man was the treasurer of the school. He was about fifty with thin white hair and a kind face. Looking at him, he looked harmless to animals and humans, but Kai Yang knew he was a sly fox!</p><p>There was once an elite disciple who dared to act arrogant here and was then pushed out of the hall a few hundred feet. His life was almost taken. Kai Yang was present, so he knew this and also knew that his old man held unfathomable strength.</p><p>Stepping into the view of the old man, Kai Yang could clearly see the old man snoring away.</p><p>This old thing! Don’t know which female Sky Tower disciple he is dreaming about again!</p><p>(ED: Doesn’t even give the old guy the benefit of the doubt O.o)</p><p>Holding a broom, he gently nudged the old man while softly calling: “Treasurer Meng!”</p><p>The old man’s surname was Meng, his first name Kai Yang didn’t know so he couldn’t call him that.</p><p>Tapping the counter a few times, the old man was finally awoken. He groggily opened up his eyes and saw that it was Kai Yang. Wrinkling his face as if he saw s**t.</p><p>(TLN: For young viewers, just in case.)</p><p>“What’s with that face?” Kai Yang asked indignantly.</p><p>Rolling his eyes: “Why didn’t you come in the morning?”</p><p>Confidently he replied: “There were too many people in the morning, and currently it’s peaceful!”</p><p>“Interrupting this old man’s rest. Do you know what respecting the elderly means?”</p><p>Leaning in, Kai Yang whispered: “Which young lady did you dream of?”</p><p>Suddenly full of energy Treasurer Meng replied to Kai Yang with eyes full of contempt and loudly proclaimed: “Your words just now, tarnished this old man’s reputation!

Full of shame, he just wanted to dig a hole and crawl inside to hide.</p><p></p>'),(143,7,'Chapter 9  Treasurer Meng',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Throughout his years at Sky Tower, the only person Kai Yang really knew was Treasurer Meng. After all, he needed to go to him every month.</p><p>Treasurer Meng had a nickname which most people referred to him as, Bully Meng. Even though his position is a treasurer, he still liked to extort contribution points from other disciples.</p><p>Take blood clotting cream for example, usually it would be sold around ten contribution points. He will sell two bottles for the price of three. Also the amount of cream that should go in two bottles, was put into three. It’s very simple he said, buy it or get lost!</p><p>Of course Treasurer Meng doesn’t always do it, only occasionally. He only targets richer disciples, for poor people like Kai Yang he doesn’t even bother. </p><p>Contribution points are hard to come by, so how can disciples stand by and be exploited? Every disciple that had been cheated by him would report him to the council. They have warned him numerous times, but he still continued, unmoved. Furthermore, his position is crucial, and there was no one who could replace him.</p><p>Due to this, all of the school’s disciples hated him to the utmost limit.</p><p>That old man was ruthless to everybody, except Kai Yang, to whom he could do nothing. That was because one time, he was peeking at a female disciple, and was caught red-handed by him.</p><p>No respect for the elderly! What a scandal! He was caught, so Treasurer Meng could only lower his head in front of Kai Yang.</p><p>It was exactly because of this that Kai Yang became very familiar with the old man.</p><p>The lecherous old man, with thick skin quickly adjusted his attitude and said: “Same as always?”</p><p>(TLN: For those who don’t know, thick skin is being very shameless)</p><p>“Yeah.” Kai Yang said earnestly while nodding his head.</p><p>Not saying a word, Treasurer Meng took out ten silvers from within the counter and recorded it down.</p><p>Taking the silvers, he asked: “How many contribution points do I have now?”</p><p>Rolling his eyes, the treasurer replied: “You earn four points each month and then use one point to exchange for 10 silvers. That leaves you with only three points to save, making a total of twelve points in your account. What, you want to exchange them for a bottle of blood clotting cream?”</p><p>“No, I was just asking.” He replied while muttering: “Twelve eh.”</p><p>Such a small amount, even if you just wanted to exchange it for a small medicinal herb, it wouldn’t even be enough.</p><p>With a serious face, Treasurer Meng whispered to him: “Little Kai Yang, you want to save up and exchange it for a tempered essence pellet. But to save up for it, and then to rank up with your speed, how long will that take?</p><p>“Won’t I eventually reach it?” He replied chuckling.</p><p>This left Treasurer Meng speechless. He thought that with his speed, by the time he makes it, this old man will have already been dead for many years.</p><p>“But Treasurer Meng, there is one thing I don’t understand.”</p><p>“Speak!” The old man said while putting on a ‘I am in a good mood so I will tell you’ attitude.</p><p>“The tempered essence pellet is a very precious medicine, how could it appear here?”</p><p>“He he……..” Speaking with a proud face: “That is because this pellet is this old man’s treasure, others don’t know about it.”</p><p>“Ah, it’s yours?” This left Kai Yang stunned. He had always thought that this pellet belonged to the school. No wonder this old thing set such an astronomical price.</p><p>“Now don’t be angry.” He joyfully said, while taking a drink from the teapot. “I won’t bully you, as long as you bring enough contribution points to exchange, Old Meng will give it to you. For my word is not nothing.”</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>“I will collect it.” He said nodding.</p><p>With his face downcast Old Meng asked Kai Yang: “I heard that yesterday you got a beating?”</p><p>Immediately Kai Yang turned around and left.</p><p>From behind Treasurer Meng shouted: “Let this old man ask, don’t be in such a hurry to walk away.”</p><p>He said, but really he was gloating inside.</p><p>Seeing that Kai Yang had no intention to stop, he straightened up and yelled: “Little Kai Yang, you should hurry up and leave. Sky Tower is no place for you to be, sooner rather than later you will be killed.”</p><p>Pausing but without turning around Kai Yang sighed: “I have no place to return to.”</p><p>He was finished if he left.</p><p>After holding the teapot for a while, Treasurer Meng said: “Then why did you come?”</p><p>Tempered essence pellet…….he he, this expensive treasure, how could this old man possibly own it? He only made up this lie to give you hope, he had never thought you would take it seriously.</p><p>Kai Yang then hurriedly went back to his hut and put the broom away, then briskly walked out.</p><p>He was going to the small village outside of Tang Lin to buy his food with his ten slivers, like he did every month. </p><p>For the first time this trip didn’t make him feel tired.</p><p>Previously, every time he walked down this path, he would get bad asthma attacks again and again. But this time, not only did this not happen, his body felt strengthened compared to before felt less strained walking down the path. Even if he walked a hundred miles, he felt that he wouldn’t tire.</p><p>Is it the golden skeleton? This made him think of something that happened this morning. While he was sweeping, another disciple had crashed into him, but on the contrary to what normally occurred he had held his ground very stably, while the disciple had fell to the ground.</p><p>Although this wasn’t much, in retrospect, it was unusual. With his weak physique, how could he not have fallen but the other party fell. It had always been him who fell.</p><p>Growing more and more excited, he thought about the changes the golden skeleton had brought to his body. Although these changes were small, gradually over the course of time they could culminate into great changes.</p><p>Thinking of this, Kai Yang recovered and soon walked to town.</p><p>Looking around, he went to the left hand side of the street. He was going to a rice shop. The shop wasn’t big and the owner is surnamed He, and was a local resident. He treated all customers the same this was one of the reasons why Kai Yang bought from him.</p><p>Such a small store could be found everywhere. The reason why Black Plum Village was very busy, was because in the surrounding area, apart them there was not only Sky Tower School but also the Windy Rain Sect. The relationship between the two could not be considered bad. The various other small schools couldn’t compare to these two main sects for they didn’t even own their own land.</p><p>It was precisely because of these two main sects that the village was able to sell many different weapons and maintain such a bustling environment full of many different wares.</p><p>Creating an environment just like the Han Dynasty’s Capital!</p><p>After walking around for awhile, Kai Yang inadvertently walked past an alley where some people were gathered. He didn’t know what they were doing, but they were pretty suspicious and gave Kai Yang an extremely vicious glare.</p><p>Chuckling lightly, he just followed the principle ‘if they don’t don’t harm me I won’t harm them’ he just ignored them. But among those three there was one who dressed in a similar fashion to Kai Yang.</p><p></p>'),(144,7,'Chapter 10  Money  Bankruptcy',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Kai Yang didn’t think much of this though, because they were in Black Plum Village, located close to Sky Tower, other disciples coming down to the Village was quite common.</p><p>A little while ago, Kai Yang arrived at the line for rice. The line was quite long, the length of two stalls. The business was very prosperous, but only has one waiter running around serving. The boss was calculating about money on an abacus at the counter, while the wife greeted the guests.</p><p>As more people finished ordering, the line gradually became shorter and Kai Yang joined the line.</p><p>“Madame” Kai Yang cried out, a 40 year old looking lady looked up to see who it was. When she saw it was Kai Yang she suddenly smiled and said, “Ah, young man, you came to buy rice again.”</p><p>“Yes.” He walked to the front of the counter, and pointed a bag behind the counter and said “Give me one bag please.”</p><p>While the lady was tying up the bag with a string she said “Young man, you buy just one bag a month, is this enough for you?”</p><p>Kai Yang replied, “It’s enough.”</p><p>“You’re lying!” The lady retorted while looking at Kai Yang ,”Look at you; such thin arms and legs. If you’re eating properly then what’s with the skinny arms and legs?”</p><p>Yang Kai smiled sheepishly, “I also go to the mountains to hunt, so therefore even with just one bag I won’t be hungry.”</p><p>While the boss concentrated on calculating the bill, he whispered to her: “Go fetch the old rice from the back and give it to this child.”</p><p>“We’ll listen to the boss.” Madame replied with a smile.</p><p>“How is this right? You are also trying to make a living here.” Yang Kai said out loudly.</p><p>The Lady immediately frowned her face, “What use is old rice? Leaving it there will only provide a place for insects to grow. Anyways, people won’t eat it. But the owner said that this rice still has some nutrients although less. You wait here I will go get some for you take home.”</p><p>As she was saying this she had already started walking towards the back room.</p><p>Kai Yang’s heart swelled, for he didn’t know what to say. Everytime he came to buy rice, the boss and his wife would always find various excuses to give him more. They say that insects will grow in old rice and the like, but in fact, it was always good rice they gave him not old rice. Their generosity gave Kai Yang hope in this sad world.</p><p>“Thank you Uncle He.” Yang Kai’s voice had a slight trembling to it.</p><p>The Boss smiled and looked up, “When living alone, don’t you have household problems? In the future, whenever you’re hungry just come to our shop, we may not have much, but we still have enough rice for you to eat.”</p><p>“Okay.” Yang Kai nodded his head, this world still had good people around.</p><p>Shortly, two enthusiastic people came to the rice store and kicked some people who were ready to order their meals from the line and away from the store front.</p><p>“Ahhhh…..” the second Little Brother fell, landed on his butt, and flipped over. It was a big problem because after he fell to the ground he couldn’t get up again.</p><p>“Why?” Boss He called towards the people who had kicked the little brother as he ran out from behind the counter and towards the two men. Kai Yang quickly helped second little brother up whilst intently glaring at the two evil faced men. One of the men, looked pale and thin, was clutching his stomach, while the other one was built like a bear, supported the pale one. These two were the ones who kicked the second brother.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>“Who’s the boss here?” The man people shouted out.</p><p>“I am, I am.” Boss He quickly replied. He was only an ordinary merchant, yet the two men who called him out had such fierce looking faces. The swords at their waist and the fierce faces that showed they were not easily trifled with. Boss He wondered what had happened.</p><p>“Well, well. So you are the black-hearted boss. You even dared to sell poisonous rice to my brother. Look at him! Originally he was a strong man, but after eating your rice he became this sickly. Normally he is as strong as a bear, but he can hardly stand now! You black-hearted person, worrying only about money and going as far as to take lives!”</p><p>At this outburst from the man, Boss He worriedly stammered out: “Ah, how could this be? How could it?”</p><p>The man then said: “How would I know? This morning my brother bought some rice from you, and made rice porridge, then he became like this after eating the rice he bought from you. I was lucky I didn’t eat any, otherwise I also would’ve become like him.”</p><p>Boss He’s forehead began to sweat, he took his sleeves and kept wiping his forehead and said “Respected customer, I fear there might be a misunderstanding.”</p><p>“Misunderstanding? Misunderstanding your mother! If it wasn’t your rice, then what caused him to become like this?” The Han man roared.</p><p>(TLN: Han people were a type of ethnic inside of China)</p><p>Kai Yang sat down and pondered the situation while all eyes were on the commotion. Boss He is such a nice person, Kai Yang couldn’t believe that this person who gave him rice, would put poison in it. Not to mention the fact Boss He couldn’t possibly have a black heart in Kai Yang’s mind, a black-hearted businessman wouldn’t be so stupid as to poison his own rice.</p><p>If these information spread how would he do business in the future? Who would dare come and buy his rice?</p><p>The two men’s poor excuses were really unbearable, and they couldn’t even consider a that it was something else.</p><p>Therefore, these two are definitely here to ruin others. But this move was a bit too evil, for they implied that the Boss needed someone to die just to earn some money.</p><p>Even though Kai Yang’s body was weak he was still a practitioner. And through these past years he had seen countless types of people, so he felt he could accurately judge Boss He. The man was also someone who he owed greatly and when Kai Yang witnessed this, it caused his face to fall. He stood up and said: “These two……”</p><p>“What?” One of the men threw him a glare, his anger evident.</p><p>Kai Yang didn’t speak, but Boss He immediately sprang in front of him. He slowly shook his head for Kai Yang to stop.</p><p>(TL: *Tear* Boss He, you’re too kind.)</p><p>“Uncle He…..” Kai Yang was stunned.</p><p>“Even in bankruptcy, avoid misfortunes!” Boss He whispered.</p><p>Kai Yang just helplessly sighed. That fact that the boss said this, signalled that he knew what the two Han men were on about. But in order to do business, one must have a good name. The earlier commotion had already attracted a lot of attention, if this continued, then the rice stand’s reputation would go down the drain.</p><p>Even if one knew what they said was false, one could only comply with them and hurriedly hope to end this fiasco before too much damage was done.</p><p>In desperation, Boss He faced the man: “Regarding your brother’s illness, I can say that it has nothing to do with me……”</p><p>After the two men heard this, one cried out in anger: “Even if it’s not related, I have already come to this rice stand. If I don’t make the truth clear, then my brother’s suffering would be in vain. He should be sent to the doctor immediately! But of course, if you are willing to shoulder the medical bills, then we are willing to drop the subject.”</p><p>After this statement it was clear the that you really needed to go bankrupt to avoid misfortunes. If people really wanted to extort money, they would do it over a period of time. The demands that these two men were making were too short sighted, if Boss He agreed to pay them off now his rice stands reputation would still suffer. For nothing is watertight and news of him selling poisoned rice would spread. This told Kai Yang that the men were either not interested in extorting Boss He for more money or that they had some other goal.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>Who would have imagined that these two Han men had not intention of compromising: “You black hearted boss. Who do think we two brothers are, to be exploited by you so freely? We two brothers were really unlucky to have bought poisoned rice from you! Where is your guilty conscience?”</p><p>That statement resonated quite deeply with Kai Yang. He curled his lip while sitting, thinking were they virtuous and living life a clear conscience?</p><p>Boss He was also stupefied. What? Weren’t these two men here to extort money?</p><p>While stunned and unsure what to do, more and more people had started to gather. A handsome boy similar to Kai Yang’s age had also appeared. From his looks, he was clearly far better off than Kai Yang.</p><p>That young man casually walked up to the men, and circled them with interest. Whilst doing so he constantly clicked his tongue.</p><p>Others may have not noticed, but with a glance Kai Yang recognised those three as the people he spotted earlier in the alley.</p><p>The crowd just stared at the boy, who had just appeared!</p><p>Weren’t these three men together? Kai Yang sensed an evil plot in the air.</p><p></p>'),(145,7,'Chapter 11  Do good and in the end you will be sent to heaven',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Suddenly the Sky Tower disciple walked out to the crowd and circled around. His expression slowly turned to one of mockery and arrogance.</p><p>But the two Han men were not easily mocked and creased their faces: “You little brat, walking around in circles has made this uncle dizzy. Do you want be the same?”</p><p>The youngster just snickered. Standing in front of the two men, watching the ‘poisoned’ man he said: “Your face is very pale. Looks like your poisoning isn’t simple.”</p><p>“Of course it’s not.” He viciously responded: “If it were not, why would I be here and with my brother, instead of at the doctor’s. We’re here to reveal this boss’ black’ heart and his true colours. Hoping that no one will buy from his store again and suffer as we have.”</p><p>This made Boss He’s face pale, for he didn’t know what the aim of these two men was. If it were extorting money then he would understand, but their motives were very puzzling and unclear.</p><p>Just when he was pondering this, Kai Yang softly inquired: “Uncle He, did you offend anybody during this time?”</p><p>Thinking hard, Boss He miserably wailed: “No one.”</p><p>“Then could it be that your rice shop prevented someone from earning money?” Even though Kai Yang was young, he had experienced many things. So this thought was not impossible.</p><p>“This is just a humble job to survive, how could I prevent others from their income?”</p><p>Now this was weird! Staring at the ground, Kai Yang thought hard, but was still confused.</p><p>Then, the Sky Tower disciple sneered and asked the two men a question. They shouted out: “Look, trickery!”</p><p>While shouting, the man resorted to a trick, to open the black heart of the poisonous apple.</p><p>(TLN: Saying for showing true colours)</p><p>This surprised people around, for the morning had been quite sluggish. The Han man was wildly hopping about, while his fists were clenched. Jumping, he went to expose the poisonous truth.</p><p>Moving like this, his once pale face became flushed and rosy.</p><p>This caused to crowd to gasp. Clearly they were shocked over this sudden change.</p><p>“Poisoned.” Looking that the two Han men, he sarcastically said: “Such skill. I respect them, respect.”</p><p>The two men couldn’t help but pale. Not only did the fallen man not turn white, he also looked like he wasn’t poisoned.</p><p>The surrounding people also started to boo. They weren’t stupid, how could they not be able to understand the situation? They didn’t know what motives these men had, but to slander Boss He’s Rice Stand was shameful. Luckily, that Sky Tower disciple had uncovered the truth.</p><p>More and more people had started to despise the men and started to praise that young man. This young man was naturally easy to like and with this incident, his reputation sky-rocketed.</p><p>While Kai Yang secretly confirmed his suspicions that they were all acting. They were acting out the play of a honourable knight uncovering foul play and protecting the weak, in order to gain reputation! If he hadn’t seen them together earlier in the alley, he was afraid he would have also believed them.</p><p>But why did they go to all that effort?</p><p>The two Han men could no longer keep up the accusations. Staring fiercely at the young man they asked: “Brat, who are you to interfere in my brother’s issues!”</p><p>Gracefully he turned around and arrogantly replied: “I am Sky Tower’s Su Mu!”</p><p>Hearing those words, one of the men became afraid: “No wonder, you are a Sky Tower disciple. A dragon within here. Today these two brothers have admitted defeat. If fate allows it, I hope we will meet again!”</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>This sentence felt like it was planned beforehand, making Kai Yang Laugh.</p><p>Su Mu just laughed coldly: “Leave safely, for I won’t escort you!”</p><p>With the situation like this, and if it were indeed no accident like Kai Yang suspected. Then the two men would leave and ‘Su Mu’ would then seek out the audience’s praise. Especially Boss He’s.</p><p>But Kai Yang didn’t want Boss He to be fooled. Before those two men left, he quickly said: “You can’t let them go, they are too despicable. Today’s victim was He’s Rice Stand, but if we don’t teach them a lesson, they may target Liu Shi’s Clothes shop or Jiang Shi’s Grocery.”</p><p>Most of people who heard this, couldn’t help but notice that what he said was correct. How could they let these despicable villains leave so easily? If they let them go today then tomorrow they might target another shop and leave them destroyed. If it came to that, then they may not be as lucky as Boss He.</p><p>Thinking of this, the people started to block off the path in front of the two Han men.</p><p>From his position, Kai Yang could clearly see the panic in Su Mu’s eyes. This in turn, lead Su Mu to source of the voice, to Kai Yang. While the two men exchanged glances and quickly readjusted their expressions.</p><p>Chuckling, Kai Yang added: “Fellow disciple, there is a saying that goes; Good people follow through to the end. Just like how Buddha went to the west, why don’t you and I both arrest these two criminals?”</p><p>(TLN: Saying that he should finish his job. Also the Buddha reference is to this. You guys should try it, Chinese folklore.)</p><p>Seeing Kai Yang’s thin and fragile physique, Su Mu couldn’t help but burst out in annoyance: “Who’s your fellow disciple?”</p><p>Kai Yang Replied: “I am also a Sky Tower disciple. I entered the Main Gate three years ago.”</p><p>This made Su Mu speechless, for he really was a fellow disciple.</p><p>“Now, without further ado.” Kai Yang came forward and said: “Throughout the land, it is important to be reasonable. While one must also be chivalrous, so brother you must not let only me take the benefit. Let both of us arrest these two cowardly men and help Boss He claim justice, while also helping Black Plum Village. ”</p><p>With this statement, the surrounding people began to applaud. This filled Su Mu with anxiety, for he felt as if he was dragged upon a pirate’s ship by this unknown brother. Even he wanted to escape, he couldn’t.</p><p>Those two men were also glancing continuously at Su Mu looking for guidance/help/assistance. Looking at them, Su Mu couldn’t do anything for them.</p><p>“Brother, let’s go!” Pulling on Su Mu’s shoulder, Kai Yang rushed over.</p><p>What is this! Su Mu was in tears, wondering where did this brother come from. This really ruined my plans! But it had already come to this point, so Su Mu could only charge over. While he was preparing to capture them, he was also signalling for them to look for a opportunity to escape.</p><p>The two men nodded, but Kai Yang saw the exchange and guessed what they were doing.</p><p>He was worried that Boss He would be tricked, so he took extra precaution and shouted: “Friends, fellow owners, don’t just watch. Come help us two brothers!”</p><p>Hearing this, Boss He also went to help. The rice stand’s youngsters joined in, their hands carrying empty rag bags. Boss He was previously abused by these two men, so naturally they would want revenge.</p><p>Seeing that Boss He had acted, the crowd couldn’t just watch and they all flocked towards the two men to capture them.</p><p>Previously the two men weren’t worried, but as they saw this scene, their faces paled. So they quickly yelled: “Don’t hit the face!” While protecting their face, they curled up on the ground.</p><p>(TL: Tsk, tsk. You’re men, and you say “Don’t hit the face!”, appalling.</p><p>ED: That’s their money maker. How will they make it as actors if they are beaten up. no mercy from you.)</p><p></p>'),(146,7,'Chapter 12  The Trick',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Bang, bang, bang, bang, the sound of the beating rang out. Even though the businesses on this street were run by ordinary people, they currently displayed a powerful fighting spirit that left others flabbergasted. These merchants, more or less did anything for money and were generally detested by others. And now, when they were given to chance to release their stress, how could they be lenient?</p><p>This was especially true for He’s Rice Stand’s waiter. With rag bags in his hands, he relentlessly beat down on the men.</p><p>Furthermore, with so many people hitting these men, they couldn’t identify who was hitting them. So these people didn’t have to worry about the consequences.</p><p>There is strength in numbers. Kai Yang only asked for aid, but before he could lift a finger, he was pushed aside by these merchants.</p><p>After a while, the beating gradually stopped and you could see the two men curled on the ground bruised all over. The rag bag had also disappeared. Looking at the men, Su Mu’s heart cried out in pain, and his leg started to cramp. For the men were beaten bloody and their faces so swollen, that even theirs mothers won’t be able to recognise them.</p><p>(ED: No mercy on their faces, crowd has the same attitude as you, so harsh</p><p>TL: Geez, just saying.)</p><p>This situation only occurred because the men didn’t have enough strength to protect themselves. Although they had swords, one could see that it was only for decoration. If they could use them would they suffer these attacks?</p><p>Though on the other hand, how could experts stoop so low as to perform such despicable acts?</p><p>Now, even though the beating was finished the merchants remained.</p><p>The two Han men with their horrendous faces, and hearts full of fear weakly called: “Su….” Their hands trembling.</p><p>Unfortunately, Su Mu’s expression changed and he loudly exclaimed: “What su, you want this young master to give you *pasty bones?”</p><p>(TLN: *Because his name is Su, a play a words with his name’s meaning)</p><p>Seeing this, Kai Yang smiled and proclaimed: “You two scumbags! I don’t know have many others you have framed, but it’s extremely hateful!”</p><p>His words words are an exaggeration, but for the merchants present, this seemed like the truth. That waiter who previously held the rag bag spat: “Pei, you trashes. You actually dared to act arrogantly at this rice stand.”</p><p>The waiter continued to let out his frustrations, but didn’t expect Kai Yang to expand on his statement: “Correct. These types of people should really die. Fellow disciple, why don’t you and I each kill one. That will teach them to break the law again and also be for the greater good.”</p><p>Hearing this remark, the two people on the floor started to break out in cold sweat and were terrified. They had never expected this frail boy to be so ruthless.</p><p>Su Mu just stared at him, trying to figure out whether or not he was joking. But Kai Yang’s face held no sign that it was a joke.</p><p>To tell the truth, although what the men did was cowardly, it wasn’t serious enough to die for. Undoubtedly Kai Yang’s punishment was a little too cruel.</p><p>Su Mu could only ask: “Brother, isn’t that a bit excessive? Right?”</p><p>“Excessive?” Kai Yang just shook his head: “If their little lie were to succeed today, then Boss He’s life would have been ruined. How would he maintain a livelihood? This is pushing people to the limits, so how is this excessive? You know, for every person, every action that they do, will have a consequence.”</p><p>Previously, when those merchant heard Kai Yang’s words, they had also thought this. But hearing his reasoning, they understood the sense behind his words and were conflicted. But the final decision wasn’t up to them, so they just stood on the sidelines. But when Boss He wanted to say something, he was stopped by a look from Kai Yang.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>“This…..this may certainly be the case, but we can’t just casually go killing people.” Now Su Mu was really worried. He didn’t think that this disciple in front of him was so ruthless and merciless. Originally he had planned it out quite well; Firstly, those two men would go slander Boss He and then he would go and stop them, saving Boss He. Then they would escape and he would receive gratitude from the Boss thus accomplishing his goal. But he hadn’t thought that such a vicious disciple would appear, so easily choosing to kill them.</p><p>This was far from good.</p><p>Su Mu could see that the two men were pleading him to save them. Within those gazes, were signs of threats. How could Su Mu not understand their meaning?</p><p>It was like being tied to the body of a grasshopper. If we are to suffer a tragic end, then you would not come out unharmed. That was their meaning..</p><p>At that moment, Kai Yang said: “Brother, there is no other method. Through my experiences, killing is a natural thing. Could it be that you haven’t killed before? Or you guys already know each other…….so you are unwilling to kill?”</p><p>This statement made Su Mu’s heart jump to his throat. Turning around to look at Kai Yang, he found a mischievous smile.</p><p>“Brother what do you mean?” With a cool face he questioned, while thinking whether or not Kai Yang saw through him. He hadn’t revealed any clues, so how could he know?</p><p>What he didn’t know, was that Kai Yang knew of his plan purely by coincidence. If not he would had also been fooled.</p><p>Boss He was also smart, he understood the hidden meaning in Kai Yang’s words and asked Su Mu: “Little brother, what tune are you singing?”</p><p>(TLN: Chinese phrasing of what are you up to/planning.)</p><p>Kai Yang had revealed a portion of Su Mu’s true colours, how could Boss He not be able to see?</p><p>Kai Yang just shook his head, he didn’t point out anything in particular but just continued to stare at Su Mu: “Brother, I think that you are a courageous person, but you are hesitating. Don’t worry, I am here to accompany you and the villagers too. So what are you afraid of?”</p><p>“What am I afraid of?” Su Mu laughed out loud, as if reassuring himself, he said: “What am I afraid of? Isn’t it just killing a person? Who hasn’t killed before?”</p><p>It was like he was unwillingly to admit he hadn’t killed before, in front of Kai Yang.</p><p>In the end, this person’s disposition shocked him. Su Mu hadn’t stepped down from the challenge.</p><p>Su Mu then directed a cold, ruthless intent towards the men lying on the ground. Looking into that young man’s eyes, those two men knew they were finished. This round, they were used too thoroughly.</p><p>“Brother, let’s do it.” Kai Yang continued to pour oil on the flame.</p><p>Breathing deeply, Su Mu slowly nodded.</p><p>Seeing this happen, the two men immediately knew their end was nigh. So how could they endure without doing anything? Jumping up, they pointed towards Su Mu and proclaimed: “Su Mu, you treacherous bastard. You asked us brothers for a favour, to slander Boss He’s stand so that you could come to the rescue and become a hero. But how do you repay us? Not only are we beaten like pigs, now we have to die for your crimes. You really are trash.”</p><p>“You lie!” Hearing his scheme revealed, Su Mu was furious.</p><p>“Hmph!” As if their injuries didn’t affect them, the men just sneered and the larger man shouted out loudly, informing all: “Everybody, young or old, today my brother and I came out and caused trouble for you. But this was all at the command of Su Mu. He had taken fancy to Boss He’s daughter, but sadly she rejected him. So he hatched a plan to obtain her.”</p><p></p>'),(147,7,'Chapter 13  Just you wait',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>When this was revealed, something clicked inside the heads of the onlookers. Many people could not help but turn to look at Su Mu with disbelief in their eyes.</p><p>So that was it! Kai Yang was satisfied that he had guessed correctly, Su Mu really had an ulterior motive. Though he had thought it was something related to profit or reputation. He hadn’t thought it was actually for his own sexual desires.</p><p>He had also met the Boss’ daughter, even though she wasn’t outrageously beautiful, she was still a work of art. Alluring body, delicate features, slim figure and the most beautiful girl in the entire village at only fourteen.</p><p>Such a young girl, unfortunately had caught Su Mu’s eye, provoking such trouble.</p><p>“What utter rubbish!” Su Mu’s face was as red as a tomato, trying to deny the truth.</p><p>Sneering the man continued to say: “I have said no lies. Even though us two brothers have our faults, and do some criminal acts,slandering Boss He and poisoning his rice this we would never do. Fellow people, you should know that sabotaging others’ livelihoods, is equal to sabotaging my own. So how can I survive? Everything was instigated by this little brat.”</p><p>This statement was very sincere, causing everybody to start laughing.</p><p>In a timely manner Kai Yang asked: “After this was over how much did he promise to give?”</p><p>“Fifty two silvers!” The man replied.</p><p>“Fifty two, that’s a lot.” Kai Yang softly said while nodding.</p><p>During this banter, Boss He was listening carefully. This made him understand the situation thoroughly, turning towards Su Mu he angrily said: “You despicable person. You actually dared to to use such dirty methods to get my daughter. Thankfully she has eyes and saw your true face. Ah, how could Sky Tower have such a degenerate disciple. You are ruining your school’s good name. You are vain and selfish, with a character completely opposite to brother Yang. I feel ashamed for your mother and father.”</p><p>Surrounding merchants also started to feel more contempt towards Su Mu’s outrageous acts.</p><p>Su Mu’s face was bright red, for he knew that he could no longer come back to Black Plum Village. For his mask had been taken away and his true face revealed.</p><p>And the source of all his misfortunes was in front of him…………this disciple! If not for him, he would have been able to win the boss’ favour and further his reputation. That would have made it easier to curry the daughter’s love for him.</p><p>But all that planning had gone to waste. Not only had he failed to gain any reputation, he had also lost reputation he had previously for being a disciple of Sky Tower.</p><p>Under that situation, Su Mu put on a calm face and turned towards Kai Yang and asked: “Brother, how may I call you?”</p><p>“You guess!” Kai Yang replied with a wink.</p><p>Taking a deep breath Su Mu said: “Though you may chose to withhold your identity, I will able able to find out. For you have already entered the school for three years, yet you are not a official disciple. That means you are a Trial Disciple and within the entire school, there are only a few of you. Finding you will be simple.”</p><p>When he finished he immediately turned around and left. In the end, he did have some strength. For those who blocked his path, he pushed them to the side. Waltzing away unhindered</p><p>When he had left, the people had only just remembered the two Han men. But where were they? There was no trace, for when Kai Yang and Su Mu were arguing, they had sneakily ran away.</p><p>The debacle had finally been resolved. Kai Yang was satisfied, for he had exposed the deceit, gained approval from the merchants and Boss He was especially grateful to him.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>That waiter also looked at Kai Yang in worship.</p><p>After the crowd dispersed, the Boss’ wife also came out. Taking Kai Yang’s hand, the more she looked, the more she came to like him.</p><p>On the contrary, Boss He’s he was full of worry: “Virtuous nephew Yang, today you have offended Su Mu. I’m afraid that in the future, this will cause you ceaseless trouble.”</p><p>After this incident, Boss He’s started to refer to Kai Yang more intimately.</p><p>“Afraid?.” Kai Yang just smiled. “The Main Gate has its own rules, so even if he hates me to death he can’t do anything.”</p><p>“Even so, you must be careful nephew. If because of your involvement in this matter you were to suffer misfortune then I as your Uncle would worry greatly.</p><p>“I will be careful.” He consoled.</p><p>Kai Yang was immensely grateful to the He couple for extending a helping hand. They even insisted he stay for dinner, originally Kai Yang wanted to, but was scared away by the boss’ wife.</p><p>“Little Yang, where are you parents? Where do you live? Have you married already?”</p><p>Looking at this, clearly the boss’ wife wanted to become his mother-in-law. Knowing this, Kai Yang hurriedly left.</p><p>When he left, he was carrying a bag of white rice, but it far surpassed the amount 20 silvers could get you. So for an entire month, Kai Yang didn’t have to worry amount his meals.</p><p>Originally, Kai Yang was worried that Su Mu would ambush him on his way back. For as innocent as Su Mu looked, he was a sinister and treacherous snake on the inside, this was not impossible. Though, even when Kai Yang returned, Su Mu hadn’t appeared.</p><p>He thought about it carefully, not attacking was the correct choice. Even though duels between disciples often resulted in death, the Main Gate didn’t allow the needless killing of others. In short, if Su Mu had attacked on his way back to the school, then when things leaked out, it would have resulted in his own doom too.</p><p>If he wanted to deal with Kai Yang, then he would definitely come to challenge him, while making a fuss too. As for the matter of Kai Yang’s identity, there is no doubt that he would be able to find it. In the Sky Tower, as long as Su Mu inquired a bit, then naturally he would find his identity.</p><p>Su Mu’s true strength, Kai Yang didn’t fully see, but he most definitely was at the peak of the tempered body. The only thing was he didn’t know what stage exactly.</p><p>Seems like he must focus more on his practises. Otherwise, Kai Yang truly couldn’t continue staying at Sky Tower.</p><p>Knowing this, Kai Yang swiftly returned back to his hut to practise.</p><p>At this hour, he was unable to practise the Tempered Body Record, but he could practise the basic skills that the school gave. These basic skills were to establish the foundations for the tempered body, to achieve spiritual consumption beyond his own body. This was the aim.</p><p>(TLN: It’s talking about things like qi/ki/spiritual energy)</p><p>Kai Yang’s previous usage of the Shaolin arts and the leg whip were all based around his foundation work. If not for this, then the skills couldn’t be considered true martial arts. They would only be considered as the basic of basic skills, essential for all schools and families.</p><p>To the left of Kai Yang’s hut, there a wooden figure. This was made, from a century old tree, by Kai Yang to practise on. Small dents were littered over it, there were even traces of blood. These were all made through Kai Yang’s many days of diligent training.</p><p>Assuming his position, Kai Yang started to hit the wooden man. He infused all his might into each strike, beating the wooden man relentlessly. Peng, peng rang out as he struck the wooden man. However, after a few strikes, he felt that something was amiss.</p><p>It was his own fists and leg so he clearly felt that they were stronger than before. From the strike and the sound it made, all of them were stronger and more stable, incomparable to before. And over time, his hand and the bones started to feel numb and warm. This clearly indicated that he was stimulating his meridians, increasing his atmospheric affinity.</p><p>Reaching the tempered body fourth stage, gives birth to the atmospheric affinity, developing your meridians further and allowing you to sense the energy more clearly. This warm feeling was Kai Yang’s meridians developing.</p><p></p>'),(148,7,'Chapter 14  Incense',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Kai Yang practised until the sun set, only then did he stop. Even after this period of time, not only was he not fatigued, he even felt more alive. Ever since he merged with that golden skeleton his strength seemed to skyrocket. Walking twenty miles today didn’t even tire him out, even with the added weight of the sack of rice he hadn’t become fatigued.</p><p>It was only when he was cultivating his tempered body, that he would truly feel pressured. Thinking about that morning’s practise, Kai Yang couldn’t help but shudder. That pressure was like the heaven and earth were crushing him, horrifying.</p><p>But with strain/pressure come development. Without extreme pressure, how could you possibly advance.</p><p>Only then, would a person’s true potential show. And only then would your strength grow, step by step, each time breaking past your limits.</p><p>Though currently, even after throwing large amounts of punches and kicks out, Kai Yang has yet to feel any fatigue. He doesn’t feel strained, how can he force out his potential and improve?</p><p>This made things difficult and made him depressed. That skeleton also gave him extreme recovery, making the basic skills of the school useless. Did that mean that he could only practise for half an hour each day at sunrise?</p><p>Daylight had around twelve full hours, and yet he could only practise for half an hour. What would he do the rest of the time? Sleep? This was obviously impossible, Kai Yang immediately rejected the idea.</p><p>(TL: wow getting stronger by only practising 30 mins each day while sleeping the rest? lucky.</p><p>ED: so glad he’s not following in the footsteps of contribution Hall Uncle)</p><p>While he absentmindedly cooked, Kai Yang thought about how he should train to exhaustion. If anyone else knew of this, they would have laughed to death.</p><p>Other practitioners may have wanted to take it easier, but Kai Yang wanted to push himself to the limit.</p><p>In the end, he still couldn’t think of any good methods. Though the main reason was Kai Yang needed elixirs to help boost his training. There were also other methods, but in the end, all of these had one thing in common, they required—- money.</p><p>In Sky Tower, contribution points were the currency. Alas, Kai Yang was poor and only had a measly twelve points.</p><p>After the rice finished cooking, he wolfed down a few bowls. Although there were no sides dishes, and he could only eat plain rice, Kai Yang was very satisfied. That was the only meal in the past few days, which made him full.</p><p>After dinner, he couldn’t go train, so he went to take a bath. After that he lay down and went to bed. Continuing his practise, there would be no result, so he might as well try to solve that problem. Consider the solutions, to hasten the work speed.</p><p>After thinking for awhile, he suddenly remembered; the black book.</p><p>One of the pages had something inside, so Kai Yang figured that the other pages would be the same. So if he had enough strength, he could unseal each page.</p><p>The first page contained the Golden Skeleton, which was also the cause of his current predicament.</p><p>While the second dealt with the methods to cultivate the tempered body with Golden skeleton.</p><p>However the third page remained blank. He had already tried to decipher it, but Kai Yang concluded he wasn’t strong enough yet.</p><p>With the first and second pages unlocked, Kai Yang could start to study them. But after good half day he still couldn’t figure them out. Until he accidentally turned to the third page and went into a trance.</p><p>Eh? Kai Yang frowned as he started to read the third page.</p><p>Almost instantly, countless gold words started to appear on the page and jumped into his mind. Then a small whirlpool started to appear in the center of the page. From it, arose an antique incense burner.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>This turn of events left Kai Yang in shock, but quickly he started to rejoice.</p><p>Ah right, didn’t he break through into the fourth stage this morning? Last night he was still in the third stage, but today he’s in the fourth. So that’s why he couldn’t access the third page before?</p><p>Although it was only one level, it had still hindered his ability to comprehend the third page.</p><p>After he thought about this, Kai Yang couldn’t help but feel regret. If this morning he had discovered this, then he wouldn’t need to waste time now thinking about it.</p><p>Calming his beating heart, Kai Yang held the incense burner and carefully inspected it.</p><p>This burner wasn’t large in size, and was a common item used by people. But it was half sealed, with a lid on the mouth and a few holes. It was also antique and of outstanding quality, but it wasn’t attention grabbing at all.</p><p>Gently he sniffed, but there was no odor and slowly he lowered it.</p><p>What is it made of? Even after a while, Kai Yang still didn’t know but could only go on the information imprinted in his mind.</p><p>After a short pause, Kai Yang opened his eyes with a strange look in them.</p><p>According to the information in his mind, this incense burner could aid him during training. The burner itself has no special properties, however if you were to gather herbs and burn them in it, the fragrance released would aid you during training.</p><p>Different herbs were needed for different stages.</p><p>Unfortunately, Kai Yang had some doubts. The plants needed to aid him at his current level were the Three Leaved Destruction/Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass.</p><p>According to his understanding, the value of these two herbs were not high but they were very hard to find. They also possessed small amounts of toxins. Inhaled over a short period of time these toxins would do no lasting damage, but over many years the accumulation in your body would really injure you.</p><p>Would these two herbs really be effective in helping him?</p><p>These herbs were definitely available in the Contribution Hall, but with Old Man Meng’s personality, he would definitely charge high prices for them. And with only a few points in his possession, how could he spend them like that?</p><p>There was only one option left. He would have to venture into the Black Wind Mountains to look for them himself. Kai Yang had already hunted in there before, so was quite familiar with its geography and perhaps the herbs were there.</p><p>Tomorrow into the mountains he shall go! With his problems currently solved, Kai Yang slowly drifted to sleep. But before he fell asleep, he checked the fourth page so as to not repeat this morning’s embarrassing action. Unfortunately nothing appeared, it seemed that Tempered Body Fourth Stage was not sufficient for this page.</p><p>The next morning, Kai Yang got up early.</p><p>Yesterday’s practise had already had such a large impact on his cultivation, so naturally he would make full use of the short time he had to cultivate. Not to mention, he was not a lazy person.</p><p>While immersing himself in the purple eastern air/gas, that slow but with the might of heaven and earth infused, Tempered Body Record fist’s might gradually unfolded.</p><p>While he was a stage stronger than yesterday, Kai Yang still didn’t make much progress on the fist. You could only perform it twenty times and when he touched his back, torturous pain responded. His back, hip and bones all ached, they felt like smashed beans.</p><p>Inhaling a mouthful of purple gas, his bodily senses as energy became clearer. His meridians all opened up and began to expel the impurities in his body.</p><p></p>'),(149,7,'Chapter 15  Looking for Medicine inside the Mountain',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>With his daily training finished, he started his sweeping, which since absorbing the golden skeleton he had been able to complete in only one hour. After he finished sweeping he ran to the Contribution Hall.</p><p>Although Kai Yang had decided to go into the mountains to find the herbs, he had no knowledge regarding herbology. He had only heard of the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass, and didn’t know what they looked like.</p><p>Most of his preparatory work for his journey into the Black Wind Mountain was done. To avoid an embarrassing situation, Kai Yang hurried to the Contribution Hall to write down the herbs’ appearance.</p><p>Originally he had planned to ask Treasurer Meng to teach him, he hadn’t expected Treasurer Meng to give him a book on herbs instead.</p><p>Looking at the book, Kai Yang found that it had an introduction to herbs and their medical properties, habitats and illustrations. Though it would give create a feeling of disappointment in those who read it. As it merely contained information on ordinary grade herbs and nothing on the herbs of a higher grade, but it was quite suitable for Kai Yang’s current needs.</p><p>Just as practitioners were classified into different ranks, so to were herbs, weapons and medicinal pellets. They were divided into, Ordinary Grade, Earth Grade, Heaven Grade, Mystery Grade, Spirit Grade and Saint Grade. Each of the Grades were then divided into the lower, middle and peak level. </p><p>Luckily the herbs that Kai Yang needed were both Ordinary Grade, Lower class herbs so they were in the book. And since they were such a low grade, their value wasn’t high.</p><p>After he left the Contribution Hall, Kai Yang went to the General Affairs Office. Afterall he was still a sweeper of Sky Tower’s and this roundabout journey to Black Wind Mountain would take more than a day. So he had to ask to be excused from his work.</p><p>The General Affairs Office didn’t make things difficult for him. They gave Kai Yang three days of leave, with his obligations taken care of he set off…</p><p>Black Wind Mountain was only twenty miles away from Sky Tower by foot. Since it wasn’t that far, Kai Yang frequently went there to hunt for his meals, making him quite familiar with the terrain.</p><p>In this mountain was a vast and diverse range of herbs. But since it was his first time collecting herbs, Kai Yang made sure to be fully prepared. Carrying his water, food supplies, a shovel and a bag, he hit the road.</p><p>Rushing over, Kai Yang came to Black Wind Mountain and surveyed the area. The Mountain was like a prehistoric monster, lying down between the heavens and the earth. Imposing, with no end in sight, the mountain with its lush forests, jagged edges proudly stood against the horizon. Standing there, Kai Yang felt a cool breeze blow through his hair.</p><p>Within Black Wind Mountain lived many ferocious beasts. Some high levelled ferocious beasts could even make martial practitioners flee with no chance of victory. So generally when people ventured into the mountain, they wouldn’t go too deep. The first thirty or so miles were classified as the safe zone, the next ten miles were the dangerous zone. And the area beyond that, was the life-threatening zone. Basically the deeper you went, the more dangerous it was.</p><p>Since Kai Yang was only looking for ordinary grade lower level herbs he didn’t need to venture too far in. So naturally he didn’t have to worry about his safety as he would only be searching within the safe zone.</p><p>Currently it was still in the early hours of the morning and Kai Yang was trying to recall whether or not he had stumbled upon those herbs in his previous trips to the mountain. But it didn’t matter whether he had or not, as he was prepared this time to find them equipped with the knowledge from the book.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>Thinking back, Kai Yang remembered that there were many potential places for herbs to grow in. In his current situation he didn’t even know the locations of the herbs he wanted to find.</p><p>But filled with anticipation, Kai Yang followed the familiar track into Black Wind Mountain.</p><p>After half an hour Kai Yang spotted his first harvest hidden within the thicket next to the track he, was a bunch of Li Chi/Sharp Teeth herbs. Harvesting them, Kai Yang put them into his bag and continued his search, thinking to himself this was a good start. Walking down the road, Kai Yang looked at the various vegetation scattered about, and memories of the forest came flooding back, informing him of his location. With his knowledge of the Mountain, gained from hunting, he could accurately create a mental map of where he was in relation to Sky Tower, preventing him from getting lost. By evening Kai Yang had collected four different types of herbs.</p><p>When searching for herbs it is naturally very hard,not to mention that many people like to come here to collect herbs, making it even harder to find them. Although Kai Yang only found four herbs, he was still pretty satisfied.</p><p>Unfortunately Kai Yang didn’t need these four herbs, to make matters worse their grades were only at Ordinary Grade, lower level too. Nevertheless if he were to take them back, he could exchange them for contribution points, so they were of some value.</p><p>At this time the sun had already started to set. Hurrying, Kai Yang finally arrived at an area which was suitable for the growth of many herbs.</p><p>This area was very strange, for all its bountiful vegetation it was devoid of any living presence. Especially for an area of thirty feet around around the area of herbs the land was completely dead and nothing grew, not even weeds.</p><p>Though in the center of the this wasteland, there were three bunches of grass. They fluttered in the wind, Kai Yang saw that they were brown coloured, and thought that is was just necrosis. But this was just the grass’ natural colour.</p><p>After looking at it in more detail Kai Yang recognised them as a type of herb and with a sigh of relief, rushed over. Smiling widely, he quickly dug them all up.</p><p>A little while later, these three herbs were collected.</p><p>As he held these herbs, Kai Yang took out the herbology book that Treasurer Meng gave him earlier and checked it to see where he had seen them before. They were indeed the Dead Jedi Tree Grass. The illustrations, growth and environment all matched up. </p><p>Dead Jedi Tree Grass grew from dead trees, which made it quite easy to find. Basically in the mountains, any place that had dead land, you could find it growing nearby.</p><p>Carefully, Kai Yang placed the grass in his bag and took out some water and food, then took out his water and food and looked for a place to eat and rest.</p><p>This time when he entered the mountains his main goal was to find the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass, now that he had found the Dead Jedi Tree Grass he need to switch his focus to the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower. Not only did he need to find the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower but he also needed a large quantity of it.. Kai Yang decided he must double his efforts.</p><p>Though right now, it was already evening and the sun had set. This was naturally an inconvenient time to search for herbs so Kai Yang decided to find a spot to rest and continue tomorrow.</p><p>Previously when he entered/forayed into the mountains, he had never stayed overnight, however as the saying goes “Even if you hadn’t tasted pork, you have at least seen a pig before”. On that note, he naturally knew the dangers of the mountains at night.</p><p>(TLN: I think it’s pretty self-explanatory. But for those who are confused, it means that even if you haven’t experienced some things, you should have some knowledge of them.) Man even got to edit the comments, no rest for the wicked</p><p>After he found the nearest tree, Kai Yang climbed up and looked for a suitable place to sleep, after locating a place he immediately laid down and closed his eyes.</p><p>(ED: Trees are so hard to locate in a forest on a mountain)</p><p>By one-thirty am, Kai Yang had yet to fall asleep, so he took out the black book and turned to page three. With a thought, the incense burner floated out.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>This was also a little mystery that Kai Yang had solved about the black book. Anything that was stored inside could be called out and returned at will. It was afterall a storage book, and the burner had obviously been placed in there before so this function didn’t come as a complete surprise.</p><p>(TL: Our MC isn’t very bright. It’s a storage book, if you could take things out, why couldn’t they be put back in? How did the burner end up in it in the first place? A mystery……..ಠ_ಠ)</p><p>What Kai Yang didn’t understand was that apart from the incense burner, other things could not be stored in the book. This made him wonder, was the black book a soul stone? Do soul stones normally have restrictions on what to accept and reject?</p><p>After playing with the black book for a while, Kai Yang fell asleep. He had just spent the entire day walking around the mountain after all.</p><p>After a peaceful night, Kai Yang got up early the next morning and practised the tempered body record for half an hour. In order to gather a good harvest, he must work very hard for the next two days. He also felt that he was on the brink of a breakthrough, not only did he feel that his atmospheric sense was at the utmost limit, he also felt his body was as well. Kai Yang just needed a final push in order to breakthrough.</p><p></p>'),(150,7,'Chapter 16  Tempered Body 5th Stage',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The discovery that he was near a breakthrough left Kai Yang ecstatic. For it took him three years to make it to the tempered body third stage. But on the second day of obtaining this book, he had broken through and now once again he will break through again. This training speed also made Kai Yang somewhat scared.</p><p>Practising the tempered body record consumed a large amount of stamina. So Kai Yang rested afterwards and slowly regained his stamina . After he had regained his stamina he ate some of the remain food and continued his search for the herbs.</p><p>Yesterday he had travelled to all the places from his memory that could potentially grow his required herbs. Today he would have to rely on luck. Fortunately, the value of these herbs were not high, so the chance of finding them today was still high.</p><p>(TL: Trust me Kai Yang, luck is the only thing you don’t need to worry about.)</p><p>After an entire day of searching, Kai Yang had found a total of seventy eight herbs and two Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flowers. This time he had finally found the herbs he required to activate the incense burner, but the quantity he had was still lacking.</p><p>Time passed by, and soon darkness came. Kai Yang was still awake though, it was not because he wasn’t tired but rather that he was too hungry to fall asleep.</p><p>(（＊〇□〇）……! &amp; (O.O) )</p><p>Originally he had planned to hunt some wild game, but had not even seen a single rabbit. Unfortunately he could only find some fingernail-sized berries which were very sour. When he finished eating them it only made him feel even more hungry.</p><p>Ah! If I knew that this was going to happen, I would have brought more rice balls! Kai Yang repented. There is no shop in these desolate areas, where is he going to find food?</p><p>This hunger was a real embarrassment. Kai Yang then saw in the distance, a hint of a fire. Instantly his energy came back, picking himself up he walked towards it.</p><p>They dared to light a fire in a forest; these people were either idiots or they had nothing to fear. This time, these people belonged to the latter.</p><p>When he approached, a person near the fire thundered: “Who!”</p><p>(TL &amp; ED: T^T, Kai Yang you’re finally going to make some friends)</p><p>At that moment, Kai Yang felt his muscles tighten and his spine shiver. The two people by the fire were vigilant. One was tall and the other was short.</p><p>One had a burly physique and held a bow with an arrow notched he pointed the arrow at Kai Yang. The other was a young boy, aged about eleven and his eyes were bright and held no trace of fear. In this boy’s hand was also a bow, and he also had notched an arrow back, but it was much smaller.</p><p>(TL: Maybe not……..</p><p>ED: How can you doubt our MC, have some faith)</p><p>Although Kai Yang was faced with the two arrows, he didn’t have the slightest intention to retaliate. Walking around, he acted as if their threats were nothing big.</p><p>“Take it easy. I only entered the mountain to collect herbs.” Kai Yang quickly said.</p><p>After they heard this, the two people looked at each other. The burly (I really want to say buff) slowly lowered his bow and arrow down. He then signalled for the boy to relax and laughed: “I had thought that the fire had attracted a wild beast, but it was just a false alarm.”</p><p>“Sorry, I’m sorry.” Kai said slightly embarrassed and laughed.</p><p>Touching his forehead, the burly man waved towards Kai Yang: “Come, the nights are cold and surviving alone here will not be easy.”</p><p>When he heard this, Kai Yang walked up and sat next to the fire. Beside him, the burly man kept looking at Kai Yang and couldn’t but feel pity when he saw Kai Yang’s thin, boney body.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>Now that they were sitting together it would be natural to talk to each other. From this chat, Kai Yang learnt that this father and son pair lived at the foot of the mountain, and came here to hunt and earn a living. Although they weren’t rich, it was enough to maintain adequate food and clothing. The boy, although he was young, was a veteran at hunting. And along with his father, they had come to Black Wind Mountains many times to hunt. Thus their knowledge of the mountain was far greater than Kai Yang’s.</p><p>Kai Yang also told them a bit about himself. After he told them that he was a Sky Tower disciple, the burly man was taken aback. While the little boy became more interested in Kai Yang and kept on glancing at him with his glossy, black eyes.</p><p>The Han man said: “My son also wanted to train to become a practitioner, but his talent was not enough and he was refused. So he practically worships you people.”</p><p>This statement made Kai Yang recall the past three years and his experiences. Not only did it move him deeply, it also made him softly rub the boy’s head with affection.</p><p>When he was about to say something, Kai Yang’s stomach grumbled loudly. The little boy stared blankly and suddenly laugh out loud, from his bag he took out some dry rations and gave it Kai Yang.</p><p>This once again made him very moved, but he didn’t accept. Kai Yang looked at the burly man and he smiled: “Eat it. It seems that you did not eat anything today.”</p><p>This time Kai Yang didn’t reject the offering and quickly wolfed down the rations.</p><p>After chatting some more the three then went to sleep around the fire. Though Kai Yang didn’t dare sleep too heavily, if any danger were to approach the father and son, he would be able to react. He also considered this to be returning the favor for giving him the rations previously.</p><p>Fortunately the night passed peacefully and nothing happened.</p><p>When the morning arrived Kai Yang didn’t wait for the father and son to wake before quietly leaving. But before he left, he left two herbs behind as a thank you for last night.</p><p>If these two herbs were crumpled they had a healing effect. Since they were constantly in the mountains, these herbs were bound to be useful to the father and son pair.</p><p>With the eastern purple gas increasing in volume, Kai Yang trained the tempered body record for half an hour. When he finished his practise, Kai Yang took in a large breath of the purple gas causing his meridians to suddenly shake. A warm feeling then began surging through his body, with the energy in his meridians swirling endlessly</p><p>The tempered body fifth stage! His intuition was correct, he indeed broke through today. After practising for half an hour he really broke through to the next stage!</p><p>Kai Yang was extremely happy, and felt more and more grateful towards the golden skeleton in his body.</p><p>Although it had not been very long since he obtained the proud golden skeleton, he had broken through twice thanks to it and the tempered body record. This speed was simply unmatched. And this was practising under quite a number of restrictions. If he could practise all the time, what speed would he reach then?</p><p>This thought left Kai Yang somewhat speechless. Though after all, the tempered body was only the foundation to becoming a true warrior. Training the early stages were easier, the higher the realms, the greater the difficulty to train in.</p><p>After a quick rest Kai Yang continued to search for herbs.</p><p>Today he had yet again gained quite a harvest. He had collected more than a dozen herbs and caught a plump rabbit, solving his food problems.</p><p>This was already the the third day of his mountain journey and he had reached the end of the ten mile safety zone. Any further and Kai Yang dared not to enter inside, for with his current strength his only option was to become food for the beasts within.</p><p>Although he did not go too deep, his harvest was still quite good. He had collected more than twenty different types of herbs, and counting the previous two days he had forty different types making his journey here very fruitful. Unfortunately the two main herbs that he needed were very small in quantity.</p><p>To find forty different types of herbs in three days was no small harvest. Even if they were all ordinary grade, lower rank herbs, he was still able to exchange them for a fair amount of contribution points. But this greatly reduced his training time, doing more harm than good.</p><p></p>'),(151,7,'Chapter 17  Battling the Demonic Beast',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>It was now the afternoon and Kai Yang had started to walk towards the track that would lead him back to Sky Tower.</p><p>Kai Yang was only given three days of leave, so he had to return before tomorrow morning, otherwise there would be harsh punishment waiting for him.</p><p>Kai Yang felt he had plenty of time and was certain that he could return before dark. Afterall, he was only hundred miles away, not a long distance.</p><p>In his heart he held great anticipation with regard to the black book’s third page. Thinking about the results it would bring for him made him delighted and put a bounce in his steps.</p><p>Halfway through his journey back Kai Yang heard an unexpected, piercing cry not to far from his position. There was the sound of a child screaming/crying mixed in.</p><p>When he heard this he paused his footsteps and strained his ears. Soon after, his face changed and Kai Yang swiftly ran towards the direction of the sound.</p><p>When he was listening to the sound, he recognised it as the sounds of the father and son pair from the night before. And that child’s crying sound was from the little boy.</p><p>Those two probably had encountered some sort of trouble, or why would they make such a ruckus. Last night they had given Kai Yang some of their rations, and even if were for their past kindness, how could he just ignore their trouble?</p><p>As he ran towards them, the father’s roaring became increasingly desperate and the boy’s grew softer and softer.</p><p>Kai Yang’s face gradually hardened and he started to have a bad feeling.</p><p>By the time Kai Yang arrived, the father’s roar could no longer be heard and he only saw a dark cave in a high hill. To the side of the cave in the midsts of some bushes, tangled between some spiderwebs was a silver bow. This bow the same one the little boy had been holding the previous night.</p><p>Without thinking, Kai Yang threw this possessions onto the ground, heightened his senses and plunged straight into that dark and sinister cave.</p><p>Although the light inside the cave was not bright, it was still enough to see.</p><p>When he looked around, Kai Yang was shocked to discover that the cave was covered in webs. On the walls and the ground, they crisscrossed each other and varied in thicknesses. Layer upon layer, the road ahead was blocked by the multitude of webs.</p><p>Not only that, the cave was damp. The water dripped down at a steady pace, and when Kai Yang took a step forward, his foot sank into the ground.</p><p>Steeling his nerves, Kai Yang walked to the sound of deep breathing. Only he saw a large human sized cocoon spun from a spider’s thread in a chrysalis-like state. At the top, it revealed a human face, that face belonged to the burly man from the night before.</p><p>Worriedly, Kai Yang dashed over to the trapped hunter, his worry eased upon discovering that he was only unconscious.</p><p>Hearing Kai Yang calling to him, the hunter groggily awoke and called feebly: “Save the child! My son was dragged further inside. I beg of you, please save my child!”</p><p>“Got dragged inside?” This shocked Kai Yang, as he struggled to free the hunter from the web. Sadly the web was too strong for his current strength, being unable to break it he could only temporarily give up. Diving into the hole, he chased after the little boy.</p><p>From behind the hunter warned: “Be careful! That is a Demonic Spider Beast!”</p><p>When he heard the words, Demonic Spider Beast, Kai Yang’s heart thumped loudly. These demonic beasts were not like ordinary wild animals; they loved to slaughter. They were true ferocious beasts and Kai Yang was not a match for even the lowest among them with his current strength.</p><p>In the Black Wind Mountains, the reason why the first thirty miles were deemed a safe zone, was precisely because there were no ferocious beasts. Unfortunately it seemed, one had appeared. This was seriously outside one’s expectations.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>Now that he knew it was a ferocious beast, Kai Yang movements became more and more cautious and soft. Slowly, he groped his way through the tunnel and after about ten feet, he spotted the little boy.</p><p>The son was in a similar situation to his father, wrapped up in a cocoon which was suspended in mid air by a larger spider web.</p><p>At the side of the little boy, there was an enormously, large flower patterned spider sucking on a straw. The straw was inserted in the little boy’s arm, and you could clearly see the dark red blood streaming out from the straw and into the spider’s mouth.</p><p>On the ground of this hillside cave, were various bones of all different types of beasts piled up like mountains. One could only imagine the amount of time the Demonic Spider Beast had spent living here and the number of poor souls, humans and animals alike, that had fallen prey to it.</p><p>Kai Yang had no time to spare to think about this spider’s capabilities and form an appropriate plan. Every second he delayed, increased the chances of this little boy ascending straight to heaven. After a moments silence, he suddenly charged forward.</p><p>The enormously, large, flower patterned spider did not expect to be disturbed at that moment. Shortly after Kai Yang charged forward, a large amount of force was applied to the side of the Demonic Spider, and a large hole was torn in the web. The flower patterned spider fell alongside Kai Yang. The little boy also fell through the hole and onto the ground.</p><p>Being attacked so suddenly caused the flower patterned spider to be furious. It’s eight long, hairy legs stamped the ground, and all of its eyes focused on Kai Yang.</p><p>Before he even had to time to get up, he was pinned down by a single single pounce from the flower patterned spider.</p><p>Kai Yang snarled, a steel fist flew out and landed squarely on the throat of the spider. This momentarily stunned it, Kai Yang took the opportunity to kick the spider, sending it flying away.</p><p>With a single roll, Kai Yang got to his feet and crouched down, his eyes fully focused on the movements of that flower patterned spider.</p><p>After that small confrontation, Kai Yang’s furiously beating heart had calmed slightly. For that demonic beast’s rank was not that high, otherwise he would even be able to struggle against it. It’s most likely that it’s only a first realm demonic beast.</p><p>However even if it was only a first realm demonic beast, given Kai Yang’s current strength it was still a difficult opponent.</p><p>As both sides were sizing up their opponents, the flowered patterned spider started to show signs of impatience, and it wasn’t just him Kai Yang began to exhibit them as well.It seemed that the little boy had lost too much blood, and was showing signs of poisoning. If the current situation could not be resolved quickly, then there would be no time to save him.</p><p>Abruptly, the flower patterned spider opened its mouth to spit out a long, gem-silk thread. It spat the thread towards Kai Yang, signalling the start of its attack.</p><p>Previously, Kai Yang had learnt about this thread’s durability, so naturally he was wary to not be trapped by it. At once, he rolled to the side and narrowly dodged the attack.</p><p>The flower patterned spider didn’t show much reaction to his dodge and continued to spit out other thread pieces. By the time Kai Yang noticed the spider wasn’t aiming at him it was already too late, the entire cave had been covered by in a web of these threads, sealing off his exits and trapping him inside.</p><p>“Is it forcing me to fight to the death?” Kai Yang laughed at that thought, any fear he had previously harboured was quickly expelled by the arrogance seeping out from his bones, pumping adrenaline through his body.</p><p>With the current situation, if he didn’t kill the spider, he would not be able to leave. Since it had come to that, he could only fight to the bitter end; either you die or I die.</p><p>With time ticking, Kai Yang could not afford to delay. Firmly planting both feet on the ground, he sprinted towards the flower patterned spider. Out flew another strand of thread, fortunately Kai Yang was on guard, so how could he not avoid it?</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>After dodging three of these threads in succession, he had finally closed the distance between them. But before he could throw out a punch, that flower patterned spider raised its front two legs and drove them towards him.</p><p>Kai Yang could only lift up his arm to block, the spider’s forelimbs pierced through his arm.</p><p>Kai Yang roared out in pain, his blood boiled out. Not only was he not in a fearful panic, instead he had an indescribable feeling of excitement and anticipation in his heart. All of his bones clanking together caused a warm feeling passed through his entire body.</p><p></p>'),(152,7,'Chapter 18  Good men will be rewarded',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Throwing out a punch, Kai Yang’s fist whistled through the air and smashed into the eyes on the left hand side of the flower patterned spider’s head. The moment his fist hit, it pulverised two eyes.</p><p>The flower patterned spider was horrified. Even with its limited intellectual capacity, it knew to fear that human with blood dripping from their arm. When it went to retract its two legs that were lodged in Kai Yang’s arms, the spider found that the arm muscles had tightened around its forelimbs so the spider couldn’t pull them out.</p><p>Kai Yang’s second punch followed shortly after his first, pulverising another two eyes.</p><p>The flower patterned spider screeched out in pain, incessantly trying to retreat, but it’s hind legs could only scratch at the ground. In desperation, it lashed out at Kai Yang, leaving many shallow wounds on his arms. Although they weren’t deep, they still drew blood.</p><p>But, the pain only served to increase Kai Yang’s excitement, his whole body bubbled with overflowing strength. The corners of his mouth curved into a cold and merciless smile, his fists flew endlessly towards the spider’s forehead. Under the unceasing barrage of attacks, the flower patterned spider’s forehead cracked open, and its bodily fluids oozed out.</p><p>A dismal whimper escaped from its mouth, the flower patterned did not wish to sit and wait for its death. From its mouth, it spat out streams of its web, and at such close proximity, the web wrapped Kai Yang up.</p><p>However at that moment, the flower patterned spider was in a horrible state; its head was disfigured so much that it had nearly burst. If it hadn’t become a demonic beast, and gained the tenacious vitality that is associated with it, it would have already died many times over.</p><p>Since this was the case, even though it had trapped him with its web, under Kai Yang’s relentless fists, it soon ceased all signs of struggling.</p><p>Kai Yang would have never imagined he could win a fight with a demonic beast. Furthermore, not only had he survived, he had also killed it.</p><p>Even though it was a first realm demonic beast, it was still not something a cultivator at the tempered body fifth stage should be able to defeat. Although Kai Yang’s wounds weren’t considered light, he didn’t feel much pain from them; as if they nothing at all.</p><p>After certifying that the flower patterned spider was truly dead, Kai Yang went to extract the leg that had pierced into his arm. When he pulled it out, a gush of warm blood followed.</p><p>(TL: O.O, you just casually pulled something that was stabbed into your arm? Oh it’s stuck, let’s pull it out.)</p><p>Without even pausing to inspect his injuries, Kai Yang tore apart the spider web that was binding him and rushed to the little boy’s side; gently cradling his body he brought him out of the cave.</p><p>The little boy’s father had managed to finally escape from his web cocoon. And just as he was preparing to run further into the cave, he saw a blood-drenched Kai Yang carry out his son. He quickly inquired: “What happened to him?”</p><p>“He has lost too much blood and has also been poisoned.” Kai Yang replied.</p><p>After reaching the cave’s entrance, Kai Yang placed the little boy onto the ground and raced towards his fallen bag. Taking out some of the herbs inside, he began chewing on them. Without hesitation he called over the hunter: “Chew on these herbs to soften them, then feed them to him.”</p><p>The hunter was already scared out of his wits, so when he heard Kai Yang’s orders, he didn’t hesitate. Swiftly, he placed the herbs into his mouth and began to chew them diligently.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>In that moment, Kai Yang’s mind was all too clear; his understanding of each herb’s medicinal properties began to appear in his mind within his mind. Which herbs could detoxify, which herbs could help with healing, which herbs could help staunch blood flow, the knowledge flowing through his mind was comparable to that of a veteran pharmacist.</p><p>After a short period of time, Kai Yang took out the herbs he had been chewing on and smeared them over the little boy’s arm. The hunter followed his actions and began to feed the chewed up herbs to his son.</p><p>Under the nervous gazes of the two people, colour gradually returned to the boy’s pale face and his breathing steadied.</p><p>The hunter could finally release the tension in his heart and fell on his buttocks. Crying out loudly he said: ”Fortunately nothing happened, fortunately nothing happened……..”</p><p>Kai Yang poured cold water on his new found hope: “Not yet, my herbs are only low levelled ones and can only alleviate his symptoms.You have to leave the mountain and find a doctor, otherwise I’m afraid that the poison will become incurable. ”</p><p>The hunter could only listen to Kai Yang’s advice. Immediately he said: “Then I shall go take him to find a doctor now.”</p><p>“There’s no hurry.” said Kai Yang as he held out his hand to stop him. “Allow your son to stabilise first then move him.”</p><p>“Oh, what the saviour says is correct.” With such a great catastrophe befalling on the hunter, he had long since lost his nerve. So whatever Kai Yang said, he would follow.</p><p>After replying, he remembered that his saviour was also injured. His injuries were not light, so he worriedly asked: “Saviour, do you not want to also treat your own wounds.”</p><p>Kai Yang replied: “Not need.”</p><p>“But you have shed such a large amount of blood, how is that alright?” The Hunter looked at him in shock.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Standing up, Kai Yang jumped up and down vivaciously. “Even I don’t know, but I feel great.”</p><p>He not only felt great, but also excited. Kai Yang suspected all this was somehow related to his golden skeleton, but how could he explain it to a simple hunter? As he thought back to the recent fight, Kai Yang’s blood began to boil once again.</p><p>That was the very first time he had ever been in a life or death situation. But he had not experienced even the slightest amount of fear, instead he had only felt enjoyment at the feeling of blood splattering all around him. Like it was the most common occurrence.</p><p>(TL: The birth of an asura/bloodthirsty demon/demon king???)</p><p>“That’s right, please wait a bit. I will return soon.” As he picked up his bag, Kai Yang once again rushed into the cave.</p><p>The hunter thought he had gone to sort out the demonic beast’s corpse, but that was not it.</p><p>Although the flower patterned spider was a demonic beast, it’s corpse didn’t hold any value; it was too low levelled.</p><p>Kai Yang’s goal was to pick herbs growing inside the cave!</p><p>Before he had begun his battle with the flower patterned spider, he had discovered a large amount of purple coloured flowers. Previously he didn’t have the time to examine them, but now that he thought back to them, his spirits couldn’t help but rise.</p><p>If he didn’t see incorrectly, those purple coloured flowers were actually the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flowers that he desperately needed.</p><p>(TL: here comes his xianxia luck!!!!)</p><p>Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flowers grew in dark and damp places with a lot of corpses. Making this cave an ideal environment for them to grow in.</p><p>With his heart full of anticipation as he entered the cave, Kai Yang nearly laughed, such was his joy.</p><p>Helping others will really reward you well. It seemed that this saying was true! If he had not come to rescue the father and son pair, then he would never have found the herbs that he was looking for.</p><p>The vast expanse of purple flowers in front of him truly were the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flowers. Plus, there appeared to be a vast quantity of them; a quick count showed there were at least thirty to forty of these flowers. These small purple flowers, all bunched together would make anyone who saw them feel delighted.</p><p>Without further ado, Kai Yang hurriedly took out his shovel and started to harvest these herbs.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>While he busied himself, Kai Yang’s heart was more than content. Just as he was preparing to leave the cave, Kai Yang discovered a red, mushroom like plant in the corner of the cave.</p><p>His curiosity piqued, Kai Yang walked towards it to carefully examine it. This thing was about the size of a bowl, dark red and was like a mushroom or fungus. Kai Yang didn’t recognise this thing, for it was not mentioned in the little book that Treasurer Meng had given him.</p><p>Could it be a priceless treasure? Rolling up his sleeves, Kai Yang went to pick the mushroom like plant. As for the matter of its identity, he could work it later; it wouldn’t take much space up anyway.</p><p>By the time Kai Yang exited the cave, his bag was filled to the brim.</p><p>“Let’s go, I will descend the mountain with you.” Kai Yang told the the hunter, treating him like an equal.</p><p>“Many thanks to the saviour.” The hunter was moved to tears, for he knew that Kai Yang was worried they would encounter more danger on the journey out. That’s why he was following them.</p><p>“We just happen to be travelling the same path, no need for thanks.” Kai Yang replied humbly, and the three of them quickly descended the mountain.</p><p>By evening they had arrived back at town, and in the dark, they searched for the doctor’s home.</p><p></p>'),(153,7,'Chapter 19  Su Mu comes looking for trouble',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Even after settling the little boy, Kai Yang wasn’t in a rush to leave. Afterall, that night, the little boy had given him some of his rations. So he had to stay until the boy opened his eyes; only after that would his heart be at peace.</p><p>Inside, the hunter was paced around restlessly, worried about his boy. Before long, the doctor shooed him out — saying he was too noisy.</p><p>“Doctor Chu said it is fortunate we did some emergency treatment. Otherwise my son would have truly lost his life. Saviour, your mercy and kindness I will be forever unable to repay. Even if I worked hard my entire life, I will be unable.”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the hunter knelt down in front of Kai Yang.</p><p>Kai Yang did not help him up but smiled and said: “Big brother Zhang, men only kneel before gold. With you kneeling, you have harmed our good relationship, you do not need to kneel in the future. I also ate some of your child’s rations, if you are talking about owing, then I owe you too.”</p><p>After finishing his sentence, he went to help hunter Zhang up.</p><p>Hunter Zhang was moved to tears: “Saviour, you truly are a good person!”</p><p>As they were speaking, the doctor walked outside and said to hunter Zhang: “It is no longer dangerous, so you need not worry. But because he has lost a large amount of blood, he will be asleep for a while longer but once he wakes up, he’ll be fine.”</p><p>When they heard those words, Kai Yang and hunter Zhang both let out sighs of relief.</p><p>Once he relaxed Kai Yang felt a wave of exhaustion flow through his body. Today had been far too exciting, he had also received many wounds and lost a lot of blood. Even with his previous energy, his body had still received damage, so when he relaxed himself, he fell asleep; sleeping until the sun rose.</p><p>Early in the morning, Sky Tower.</p><p>Many of the disciples woke up early, with high spirits. Together they gathered in a certain region, waiting in anticipation. Thirsty eyes, craned necks, a unruly state of mind; these things were consistent throughout the crowd. Together they surrounded the house like a housewife who had waited many years for her husband to return home. Exemplifying that devotion and expectation.</p><p>With the passing of time, the number of people who gathered gradually increased. It was like they were telepathically connected, everybody turned their heads at the same time to look at one place.</p><p>That place was the path that lead to the residence of Kai Yang, a small little hut.</p><p>Today was the day when they could once again challenge Kai Yang! This was equivalent to a free contribution point box, how could these disciples give up this golden opportunity? Some people pitied Kai Yang’s predicament, for every five days he was challenged and beaten to a pulp. This was really a bit too brutal.</p><p>However sympathy alone could not help Kai Yang. Even if they did not challenge him, many others would gladly take their place. In the end, he will still be beaten to a pulp, so they might as well do it themselves, at least they could take it easy on him. When they thought about it like that, they all came to try their luck.</p><p>En, if he chose me, I will definitely hit lightly, so he will not be injured too badly. Many people were making excuses like this in their hearts.</p><p>Typically Kai Yang was already awake and had begun to sweep the area by this time, but it was really strange today. Even after waiting quite a while, they still had not seen Kai Yang. Even when they tiptoed over to look around, they could not find him.</p><p>“What’s with Kai Yang? Did he oversleep? How come he has yet to come out?”</p><p>“I don’t know, thinking about it, has anyone has seen him in these past few days?”</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>“Could it be that he has already left Sky Tower?”</p><p>“Impossible, it’s not like you don’t know about Kai Yang’s stubbornness. Even if you killed him, he would not leave. If he really wanted to leave, he would have left a couple months ago, when he was made into a trial disciple. Why would he wait such a long time just to leave in the end anyway?”</p><p>Surprisingly with all the discussion going on, no one knew that a few days prior, Kai Yang had asked for leave to enter the Black Wind Mountains and had yet to return. Though this was no surprise, for during normal days, Kai Yang did not interact much with others, and so naturally no one knew of his whereabouts. </p><p>While this group were making a ruckus, a person had started to walk towards this crowd. His face was flawless like jade, and his body also like jade, he really was a handsome youth. But no one knew why at that moment, this youth’s expression was very gloomy. As he walked, he was gnashing his teeth and cursing someone.</p><p>Following behind this youth, were a large number of Sky Tower disciples. Surrounding him, they made him the centre of attention.</p><p>While the youth was surrounded he showed a very unpleasant face. He said in doubt: “Why is it? Why are there so many people here?”</p><p>In response to his request someone hurriedly came up to him and informed him in a lowered voice: “Master Su, today is the day when we can challenge Kai Yang. So many fellow disciples have gathered here today to collect some contribution points.”</p><p>The youth that was called Master Su furrowed his eyebrows before laughing heartedly. “Looks like our fellow disciple Kai Yang is in an abyss of suffering.”</p><p>His words were full delight at Kai Yang’s misfortune.</p><p>“En. Basically he is challenged every five days. Not only that, he will not admit defeat unless he can no longer stand properly.” The person who had spoken earlier further explained.</p><p>Master Su laughed again: “En, this young master feels that the resentment in his heart has decreased greatly. But this is not enough, I must make him leave Sky Tower. For as long as he is not a Sky Tower disciple I can do whatever I please with him and no one can say a word.”</p><p>“Master Su is right. That brat dared to tarnish your good name, he really cannot differentiate between a noble and a horse. He doesn’t even bother to inquire as to Master Su’s identity. He is too arrogant!”</p><p>This ass-kissing made Master Su feel much better, causing him to repeatedly nod his head.</p><p>Master Su, whose reputation Kai Yang had tarnished, was exactly the same Su Mu he had met in Black Plum Village. It was the same Su Mu, along with the two Han men, upon whom Kai Yang had enforced justice. Because of this, Su Mu had flown into a rage, enquiring around Sky tower on the identity of Jai Yang.</p><p>In the end, he had found out about the ins and outs about Kai Yang in less than a day. Afterall, he did have his own network of connections and channels. But under the iron rule of the Main Gate, he could not easily move his hand and had waited until this day to bring a bunch of people over to cause trouble for Kai Yang. Unfortunately he didn’t expect that so many other people would also come for Kai Yang.</p><p>This made Su Mu somewhat displeased, Waving his hand, he said: “Make them leave. Tell that today, Kai Yang will only be mine today.”</p><p>This statement made Kai Yang sound like some sort of young girl, or like an available prostitute, ready to be brought. </p><p>The person next to him promptly walked into the crowd, cupped his hands and said: “Fellow disciples, today’s battle with Kai Yang, Master Su has already reserved it. So I ask my fellow disciples to please line up at the door and watch. I am sorry any inconvenience.”</p><p>This announcement took many by surprise. They all turned to Su Mu in confusion and asked: “Why should we? Everytime, Kai Yang would use his broom to choose the opponent, so for what reason should we allow you to fight him? Even if he did not choose, shouldn’t it be first come, first served?”</p><p>After that was said, someone pulled at the speaker and whispered to them: “That is Su Mu. Do you know who Su Mu is?”</p><p>“Who?” This person had just been accepted, so he really didn’t know who Su Mu was.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>“Idiot! There is an Elder who is surnamed Su, there is also a core disciple within the top ten surnamed Su. Why don’t you say who he is?” That person spoke.</p><p>Although the one listening didn’t nod his head in understanding, he still understood the meaning behind those words. He had been temporarily stunned by the information. When he heard that Su Mu had such powerful people backing him, how could he dare make another sound?</p><p>“Winning against Kai Yang will not even earn me many contribution points, so it’s best not to offend him.”</p><p>“Yes yes yes.” The person replied while cold sweat dripped down his back.</p><p></p>'),(154,7,'Chapter 20  Burn the house',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Su Mu was very satisfied with the reaction to his demand, but witnessing this made him snort softly in disdain.</p><p>Although today’s battle with Kai Yang had been secured by Su Mu, the crowd had yet to disperse. They didn’t know what Kai Yang had done to offend Su Mu, so of course they wanted to stay behind and watch the show.</p><p>After waiting for some time, Kai Yang still hadn’t appeared. Su Mu impatiently asked: “Where is he?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Usually, he is already out sweeping the grounds by this time, so I don’t why he has yet to come out. Master Su, should we check his hut?”</p><p>After thinking for a bit, Su Mu nodded and replied: “That’s a good idea. He is just a small and insignificant sweeper, yet he dares to make this Master Su painstakingly wait for him. I will make him pay for this later!”</p><p>The location of Kai Yang’s residence was no secret, so the people around Su Mu swiftly lead the way.</p><p>The ones who had stayed behind to watch the show also followed, creating a grand procession of disciples.</p><p>A short while later, the procession of people had arrived at Kai Yang’s small hut. When they saw the pitiful and wretched state of his hut, with holes littering the hut walls, they were not surprised. For no apparent reason, Su Mu lifted his hand pointed at the hut: “That brat lives here?”</p><p>“In response to Master Su’s question, because Kai Yang is a trial disciple, he must provide for all his own clothing, food, housing and training materials. The Main Gate will definitely not provide them for him. This hut was probably built by his own hands.”</p><p>“Good good good.” Su Mu laughed happily. Thinking about how drenched Kai Yang would become on rainy days elevated his spirits.</p><p>Sighing, Su Mu controlled his smile and strode confidently, like a dragon or a proud like tiger, forward. With a loud voice, taking care to clearly articulate each word he called out: “You, Kai Yang. Get your arse out for this Master Su and prepare to receive a nice beating!”</p><p>That loud shout was powerful, like a storm and yet unlike a storm it was not detached and uncaring it was filled with utter hatred.The hatred and bloodthirsty desire, made everyone present shiver in their shoes. This clearly displayed the level hatred between Kai Yang and Su Mu to the crowd, evidently it was not a small issue.</p><p>Su Mu stood their, exuding a majestic presence, in this moment it appeared that not even the eight winds could move him. After he finished shouting, he waited expectantly outside the door for Kai Yang to coming running out, while pissing his pants, and crying to beg for mercy. The more he thought about it, the more arrogant be became.</p><p>But no matter how long he waited, there was not a even a hint of movement within the hut.</p><p>Su Mu’s face was now full of rage, snarling he called out again: “Kai Yang, be a smart one and get your arse out here. Otherwise we will come inside and drag you out.”</p><p>Yet, there was still no reply.</p><p>Su Mu now felt there was something odd, for if Kai Yang was really inside, there should be at least sounds of him breathing. Could it be that he was not inside?</p><p>Su Mu signalled one the people around him exaggeratedly. That person promptly sprang forward, forcefully kicked down the wooden door and rushed into the small hut.</p><p>Not long after they had entered, that person ran out again and reported to Su Mu: “Master Su, there is no one inside. There is also a small accumulation of dust. Looks like this trash knew that a calamity was approaching, so had fled already.”</p><p>“Fled?” Su Mu nearly vomited blood in anger. He had racked his brains, scheming for many days all in preparation for this day, the day he would get to exact his revenge and make up for the shame he suffered at the hands of Kai Yang. He had even brought many disciples to come and watch the show, yet that Kai Yang had unexpectedly fled?</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>This was like a powerful punch had been let out, but landed on a piece of cotton. It made Su Mu feel gloomy and depressed.</p><p>“Speaking about it, these past fews, we haven’t seen even a hair of Kai Yang.”</p><p>“A wise man will submit to the circumstances. Since Kai Yang had offended this Su Mu, he probably knew that all hell would break loose. Forcing him to leave the Main Gate.”</p><p>“No wonder even after waiting such a long time, he had yet to appear.”</p><p>“Ah! Now that Kai Yang has left, we will no longer be able to obtain easy contribution points.”</p><p>The crowd muttered softly, none of their mutterings escaped Su Mu’s ears.</p><p>Although he was pleased by the respect they were showing him, he hadn’t been able to extract his revenge. Thus Su Mu’s heart was still unsatisfied.</p><p>After thinking for awhile, with a gloomy face, Su Mu could only accept the fact he would not get to extract his revenge on Kai Yang today. In a fit of rage he said: “That trash really got lucky, however my anger will not dissipate, I will get something. Burn down this pitiful hut.”</p><p>This demand alarmed everybody present, even the people Su Mu had brought with him were stunned. One asked: “Master Su, is it a good idea to start a fire inside the school?”</p><p>“What are you afraid of?” Su Mu eyed him: “Even if the sky falls down, I will be there to catch it. Furthermore, it isn’t even important to the school. So what if it is destroyed, it wouldn’t be much of a loss. Also, leaving this ragged hut standing will harm this younger master’s eyes.”</p><p>Hearing him say that, dispelled the concerns within their hearts. With the Master Su as backing them, burning this hut is nothing.</p><p>Before they lit the fire, some went to look for dry grass to use as kindling.</p><p>After awhile, everything was prepared. Grinning, Su Mu lit a torch, its flames distorted his face greatly making him appear evil?.</p><p>“Kai Yang, I warn you never to let me see your face in the future. Otherwise I will not let you live or die!” Su Mu said while grinding his teeth. Just as he was preparing to throw the torch into the hut, a person to his side tapped his shoulder and whilst releasing a bloodthirsty aura enquired of him: “What is this for?”</p><p>Su Mu didn’t even need to think before replying: “Burning a house.”</p><p>“Why are you burning my house?” That person’s voice carried a hint of anger.</p><p>“Your house?” Su Mu curled his lip ferociously and turned his head. As soon as he saw the speaker, he immediately jumped to the side like a frightened rabbit seeing a wolf. Then with an exaggerated movement, he assumed a defensive posture. His face was filled with alarm and the hairs on the back of his neck all rose.</p><p>It was because the appearance of the person who had spoken was too frightening. Not only were his clothes all tattered, his hair was messed up, with plants sticking out all over the place and dirty beyond compare. His body also displayed numerous bloody marks, his clothes were bloodstained and a bulging bag was tied around his back. God only knew what was in there.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew past, causing his tattered pants to flap revealing a strong and sturdy leg covered in leg hair. </p><p>The wind carried with it the stench from Kai Yang’s several dirty body, Su Mu was unable to stomach that smell. That appearance, coupled with the blood and smell made Su Mu want to vomit up his three meals.</p><p>That posture, that manner, was strangely familiar.</p><p>If he were to hold a broken bowl in one hand, then he would look exactly like a beggar.</p><p>But…….why did he feel that this horrifying person looked familiar?</p><p>Su Mu looked more closely, becoming more and more confused. After he thought for a while he cried out: “Kai Yang!”</p><p>If it’s not Kai Yang, then who could it be? Even though his body shape had changed and his face was covered in filth, how could Su Mu, who hated Kai Yang deep down in his bones, not recognise him? If he could he not recognise him then who could?</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>Kai Yang also recognised Su Mu. Grinning widely, he revealed a set of ivory white teeth. “If it isn’t fellow disciple Su who brazenly tried to frame others in Black Plum Village?”</p><p>The voice that said so was full of ridicule, turning Su Mu’s white face a deep red. Stamping his foot Su Mu retorted: “Kai Yang, you did not choose to walk the path to heaven but chose to walk through hell’s gates! You are destined to die today!”</p><p>“You want to find issue with me?” His brow creasing, Kai Yang asked.</p><p>“Nonsense!” Su Mu cried proudly. “You thought I came to see you?”</p><p>“If you have something to settle with me, come and find me. Why do you need to burn down my house?” Kai Yang questioned.</p><p>Su Mu promptly threw the touch away and rushed to step on it; like he was stamping on Kai Yang directly. Venting on the torch, after a while, the torch was finally stamped out.</p><p>This moment of pause allowed the people present to understand what was happening. They finally realised that Kai Yang had not run away from fear of Su Mu, but rather that he had only left to complete some business.</p><p>But what business did he have to complete which had caused his appearance to become so appalling? Such bloodiness, isn’t it a bit too much? Also the tears in his clothes were obviously made by some sort of sharp weapon. Who did he go and fight with? And was it a life and death type of fight?</p><p></p>'),(155,7,'Chapter 21  I will give you three moves',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Those bloody wounds naturally came from the fight with the flower patterned spider. Back then he didn’t have enough time to treat them, because he had to bring the little boy back to the village to see a doctor and then he had collapsed from exhaustion and immediately fallen asleep once he knew the child was safe.</p><p>Kai Yang had slept until the next morning without waking. And after he saw that the little boy was awake and well, Kai Yang had hurried back to the Sect. When he drew near, he saw a hoard of people surrounding his home. They all held torches and looked like they were going to burn down his home. But how could he allow this? Naturally he would go and ask why they were doing this, but he didn’t expect it would be Su Mu who came to look for trouble.</p><p>Just as the owner of the house appeared, Su Mu who had intended to burn it down, did not even feel the tiniest bit guilty. Instead he felt excited and pointed towards Kai Yang: “Kai Yang, don’t you dare say that this young master did not give you a chance. So if only you will……”</p><p>“Wait a moment.” Kai Yang lifted his hand to stop him, and then leisurely entered his hut.</p><p>“Hey……..” With his words stopped halfway, Su Mu felt like he ate a fly; the ones that liked to appear before dung piles. He felt extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>“Master Su, this person doesn’t give one face at all.” Someone cried out seeking justice for Su Mu.</p><p>“Humph!” Sneering Su Mu said: “Later, help me beat him ruthlessly, for I heard that this brat never surrenders. So no need to be soft with your strikes. Today, I must teach him the consequences for offending this young master.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>When he entered his hut, Kai Yang took off the bag on his back. Inside this bag were herbs, his precious harvest from the three days he spent on the mountain. If he didn’t secure their safety first, his heart wouldn’t be at rest.</p><p>When he put the bag safely away, Kai Yang exited his hut and said to Su Mu with a serious face: “What was it that you wanted to tell me?”</p><p>Su Mu looked at him, his face a picture of abhorrence. His face full of bitterness, like he was going to spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Previously, before he could say his perfectly rehearsed lines, he had been interrupted by Kai Yang. But now that Kai Yang had asked him what he wanted to say, he couldn’t wait and yelled out: “Kai Yang, don’t you dare say that his young master did not give you a chance. So as long you are willing to kneel down and kowtow for me in front of all the fellow disciples present and call me your grandfather, I will spare your life! Or else…….humph, humph, humph…….”</p><p>The message was very clear, explicitly implying the threat unsaid.</p><p>When he finished, Su Mu’s face was filled with his desire for revenge; it really showed how he felt about Kai Yang.</p><p>Slowly Kai Yang nodded his head, grievingly he looked at Su Mu.</p><p>“What?” Su Mu was unsure, for Kai Yang’s face was calm and composed. This made him somewhat restless, for he had been played around with by him before in Black Plum Village. He was still a bit traumatised from the experience.</p><p>“Unfilial!” Kai Yang sighed.</p><p>The crowd was stunned, Su Mu was stunned, they were all thinking how was this unfilial?</p><p>“What do you mean?” Su Mu viciously asked.</p><p>“Isn’t clear? Let me teach you!” With a face of good intent, Kai Yang earnestly said: “Let me ask you, do you have elders in Sky Tower?”</p><p>“Looks like you really do have eyes!” This made Su Mu’s tail rise up into the heavens.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>Kai Yang smiled. For it was just like he guessed; Su Mu had someone to back him up. Otherwise how would he dare to act so brazenly as to burn his house.</p><p>“Your elder must have no small amount of power within the Main Gate right?” Kai Yang asked again.</p><p>“He’s an elder!” Su Mu snorted out. “I also have an older sister who is a core disciple! As long as she wishes for it, a single finger will be able to kill you!”</p><p>Kai Yang understood, he had a general understanding about the ins and outs of Su Mu’s character. Patting his back he said: “That’s right, so unfilial!”</p><p>“What is right or wrong?” Su Mu was furious. He was pulled around in circles by Kai Yang and now his mind was a mess. And he still didn’t know what he meant.</p><p>“Such an easy affair and yet you still don’t understand. How has your mind developed?” His brow creasing, Kai Yang looked at Su Mu pitifully and patiently explained: “With your older sister’s position, then she would be my senior. If I were to really call you that, then how would your older sister call you? Then what would that elder call you? Unfilial. How unfilial! If I were that elder, I would you lock you up in the Destitute Dragon Stream. So that in this life, you can’t even dream about leaving it.”</p><p>Su Mu’s entire body shook and his face paled. Destitute Dragon Stream is a region in Sky Tower that was the most frightening place in the entire school. In the hundreds of years since the school’s founding, any disciple that was found to have broken rules or committed heinous crimes was thrown into that region and never seen again. As long as you were thrown in Destitute Dragon Stream, you were a dead man.</p><p>Destitute Dragon Stream; these three words were well-known in the surrounding thousand of miles. It’s infamy was spread far and wide.</p><p>Su Mu wasn’t afraid of Kai Yang, however those three words struck fear into his very soul.</p><p>One of the people that Su Mu brought with him sensed something was off with Su Mu and hurriedly said: “Master Su, this brat’s mouth is very sharp, making him this confident. The reason why we came today, was to help you vent your anger.”</p><p>“En.” Regaining his senses, Su Mu shouted indignantly to hide his embarrassment: “Kai Yang, don’t talk about nonsense. If you will not kneel down and beg for forgiveness, then this young master will make you wish that you were never born in this life.”</p><p>His eyes glinting coldly, Kai Yang held up his fists: “Disciple Su, why don’t you come and exchange some blows with me?”</p><p>Su Mu replied in contempt: “I would like to, unfortunately you don’t live up to expectations. You are not qualified! This master is at the tempered body ninth stage!”</p><p>Hearing this, Kai Yang understood. The Main Gate rules state that if you want to challenge other disciples, the level difference must not exceed more than three levels. Su Mu really couldn’t duel Kai Yang, their level difference was far too large.</p><p>This was also the reason why Su Mu had brought people over with him, they weren’t just here to watch the show.</p><p>With a face full of loathing, a cold smile, Su Mu tilted his head towards Kai Yang: “Everybody, this Yang disciple has reached the tempered body third stage. So which brother here is willingly to fight him?”</p><p>“Tempered body third stage, what a high stage!” Everybody roared in laughter, for none of them had entered earlier than Kai Yang. Yet which one of them was not higher than him?</p><p>“Allow me to Master Su, for my cultivation is within the limit. Though I am only at the tempered body fifth stage. It should be enough to play satisfy disciple Kai Yang!” A disciple said while walking through the crowd and looking disdainfully at Kai Yang.</p><p>Kai Yang looked back at him laughing; their information was already long outdated.</p><p>If it were five days earlier, he really would be at the tempered body third stage, but it is now longer the same story.</p><p>But of course, these types of things Kai Yang wouldn’t publicise. To advance two stages in five days, this speed was far too strange, such a monstrous thing would only attract unwanted attention.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>A person who had come with Su Mu said: “Yang disciple, I am called Zhao Hu. You must remember who it was, that beat you today!”</p><p>“I have remembered it.” Kai Yang replied seriously.</p><p>Looks like that Zhou Hu was intentionally trying to give Su Mu face thought Kai Yang. Walking to face Kai Yang, he exaggeratedly waved his fingers: “Yang disciple, in order to not allow you to say I didn’t give you face, I will allow you three moves. As long as you can make me take one step, it will be your victory. If not, please don’t think of this disciple’s strikes as ruthless.”</p><p>This act of provocation contained the red fruit of contempt. To Su Mu, who was watching this, his heartbeat quickened in anticipation. This child Zhao Hu, he really knew how to thoroughly humiliate others. His choice of words wasn’t bad.</p><p>Although the difference between the tempered body third stage and the tempered body fifth stage consisted of only two stages, there was a large gap between each stage. Between these those two stages, there was a gap as large as a river separating them. And the strength that could be released when comparing the two were on completely different levels, like heaven and earth for these low level practitioners.</p><p></p>'),(156,7,'Chapter 22  Utterly defeated',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Oh by the way</p><p>Atmospheric sense → Atmospheric energy (Didn’t make sense anymore so we changed it.)</p><p>Besides, currently Kai Yang was in a very sorry state; with one look you could see that he had experienced some sort of tribulation. How much strength did he have remaining to fight? Additionally he was very skinny and malnourished to begin with, easily allowing others to look down upon him.</p><p>Practically everybody present believed that Kai Yang would be unable to escape the calamity today. Even Xia Ning Chang who was situated in a nearby tree felt the same way.</p><p>Xia Ning Chang, who had become a Dark Hall disciple, had come once again to record the outcome of Kai Yang’s battle.</p><p>“How is this allowed. I cannot allow my fellow disciple to be disadvantaged.” Kai Yang asked, hesitating slightly.</p><p>“There is nothing to worry about.” Insisted Zhou Hu. “Since I became a disciple, allowing you these three moves is something I should do! Ha ha!”</p><p>“Okay then.” Kai Yang replied, looking somewhat reluctant: “Since Zhou disciple said so, then this senior will not be impolite.”</p><p>“Bring it on!” Zhou Hu bellowed loudly, while he steadied himself and planted his two feet firmly onto the ground. His body’s muscles bulged and his blue veins popped out all over his body.</p><p>On the other side, Kai Yang walked forward step by step, his thin arms and legs tensed. Zhou Hu sneered internally and thought: ‘Just with your weak physique, merely one breath from me and I will be able to blow you away. So what strength could you possibly reveal?’</p><p>Leisurely strolling forwards, Kai Yang walked up to Zhou Hu. He balled up his fist, slowly waved it in front of him. Smiling he cautioned: “Zhou disciple, I senior will now really hit you.”</p><p>“Come then!”</p><p>Just as those words came out, Kai Yang’s fist had already been released; striking right into Zhou Hu’s abdomen.</p><p>“Bang!” That sound rang out, however none of the people present saw Kai Yang act; that fist which strangely hit Zhou Hu.</p><p>As his face paled, Zhou Hu couldn’t help but clutch his stomach and had to take a few steps backwards.</p><p>“Bang!” The second fist had already arrived before he could recover. It landed on his abdomen once again. Zhou Hu bent over clutching his stomach, as he felt his stomach acids rising up.</p><p>“Pa!” Kai Yang kicked out and hit Zhou Hu’s chin. He cried out once before falling to the ground, motionless.</p><p>He won!</p><p>A great silence ensued, it was so quiet that you could have even heard a pin drop. One by one, everyone looked at Kai Yang, the shock apparent on their faces. Su Mu’s eyes were especially wide, so wide that they looked like they were about to fall out of their sockets.</p><p>Two punches, one kick was all it took to send Zhou Hu, who was at the tempered body fifth stage, flying away. Fu*k! Is this really the strength of someone who is at the tempered body third stage?</p><p>Although from the start of the battle to the end, Zhou Hu did not retaliate, this power was far too much. A person who weighed about one hundred pounds was struck so hard he fly a few feet out. If you didn’t exert some serious effort, how could this occur? Not to mention that speed was unparalleled. One moment Zhou Hu was smiling arrogantly, and the next he was unconscious.</p><p>They could not believe the battle that had just occurred before their very eyes. Not to mention Xia Ning Chang, who was sitting in the tree and needed to record the battle.</p><p>In her small book, it clearly stated that Kai Yang won the battle. In the past two years, he had been in one hundred and forty-seven battles and had lost them all. Unexpectedly he had changed this record today!</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>He had also won the battle in a swift and efficient manner. Originally, Xia Ning Chang was gracefully standing on a branch, channelling her energy to balance herself. But due to the shock of his victory, she momentarily lost her concentration and fell off the branch, plummeting to the ground.</p><p>A Masked female could be seen crashing down from a thirty foot high tree. As she fell butt first down to the ground, you could hear her screaming “Ai~ya!”.</p><p>Thankfully she had fast reflexes and an equally fast reaction speed. At the last moment she channeled some energy into her body to cushion the fall. Otherwise she would have come out with far more serious injuries. Though her buttocks still burned in pain causing her, muscles to tense; hot enough to make water steam.</p><p>As she stood and enduring the pain,one could see her two beautiful legs shaking. Xia Ning Chang looked around nervously, but realised there was nobody present and released a sigh of relief.</p><p>If this scene was seen by others, then she would have lost much face.</p><p>Activating her internal energy, she dissapitated the pain on her bottom. Her eyes glinted, for Xia Ning Change could not wrap her head around Kai Yang’s strength. He was just gone for a few days, so how did his strength increase this much?</p><p>Those people who had witnessed the scene naturally could not be compared to Xia Ning Chang. Their cultivation was far lower than hers, so they couldn’t see the truth of the matter.</p><p>In that moment when Kai Yang had struck out, Xia Ning Chang clearly felt the atmospheric energy within Kai Yang’s channels had been aroused. This clearly demonstrated that he was at least at the tempered body fourth stage, additionally it even looked like his actual strength surpassed this stage.</p><p>But wasn’t he only at the tempered body third stage a few days ago?</p><p>That damn disciple! He unexpectedly hid his true strength, and not only did he give everyone a shock, he also made some fall out of trees. This was hateful to the extreme!</p><p>Unconsciously, Xia Ning Chang had placed all the blame upon Kai Yang for her sore bottom.</p><p>Kai Yang glanced over to the place where Xia Ning Chang was hidden. When she had fallen, Kai Yang managed to hear her short scream, but because the distance between them was too large he hadn’t been able to spot her. Since he didn’t find anything abnormal he didn’t investigate further. He then wrinkled his eyebrows, as he looked down at his clenched fist, he felt somewhat unsatisfied.</p><p>Of course Kai Yang was unsatisfied, for it was his very first battle with another human since he had obtained the golden body. Due to the fact that he hadn’t controlled his strength properly, Zhou Hu was sent flying away. Originally he had only planned to send his opponent back a few steps, but it looked like his power was a bit greater than what he had imagined.</p><p>At the scene, Su Mu was the first to recover. As he pointed his finger to Kai Yang, he yelled loudly: “You cheated!”</p><p>Kai Yang turned around and calmly looked at Su Mu: “Su Disciple, you can eat whatever you want to, but you cannot say words recklessly. When did I cheat?”</p><p>Su Mu was at a loss for words. It was true, when did he cheat? Zhou Hu had intentionally stood there and declared that he would take three strikes. Unexpectedly he was truly defeated in three moves. Under the numerous gazes of the crowd, how could he possibly cheat? How could he cheat?</p><p>“Master Su, it seems that our information was not correct. This brat is not at the tempered body third stage! I’m afraid that he has already ranked up, otherwise how could he possibly defeat Zhou Hu?” Someone who had keen eyes and a shrewd mind quickly realised, whispering in Su Mu’s ear.</p><p>“So it was like this.” Su Mu nodded, his face darkening. “Zhou Hu was too arrogant. If he had retaliated, how could he lose?”</p><p>In Su Mu’s mind, he thought that the reason why Zhou Hu lost was because he had underestimated his opponent. For he believed no matter how much Kai Yang ranked up, he would have only gone up to the tempered body fourth stage. With that large gap in mind, if Zhou Hu had retaliated, then Kai Yang would have been the one to be utterly defeated.</p><p>“Brother Kai Yang, you have done well to hide your strength!” Su Mu said coldly and gloomily to Kai Yang. Today he had failed to extract his revenge, so the suffocating feeling within his heart was not gone</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>Kai Yang shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>“Let us settle the score later. Next time, you will not be so lucky!” Su Mu coldly declared to Kai Yang. Then with a wave of his hand, he started to lead the people back, while also motioning for some to carry the unconscious Zhou Hu. But before he left, he directed one final bitter glare at Kai Yang.</p><p>This enmity has been sealed for now, though Kai Yang didn’t mind. In any case, in the Main Gate, there was only the Main Gate’s rules. So if you wanted to cause any trouble, you could only do it in the form of duels.</p><p>Moreover, he still needed to spar with others, otherwise he wouldn’t know the true extent of his growth. With that in mind, Kai Yang thought that the feud between Su Mu and himself was a blessing disguise.</p><p>Today’s battle was not exciting enough, ah, Kai Yang was left feeling unsatisfied.</p><p>With Su Mu gone, the entertainment gone, the crowd naturally dispersed. Though many of them still replayed the recent miracle in their minds, of that two year trial disciple Kai Yang. He had obtained his first victory. Although it was very fast, he had still won.</p><p></p>'),(157,7,'Chapter 23  An incredible thing',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>News of this battle was soon a hot topic between fellow disciples, with others seeking out those present to hear the details. If not for Su Mu’s status, then the news would have long since been spread to the ends of the earth. However since Su Mu was involved, the disciples could only hide it within their stomachs, discreetly talking about it.</p><p>In Kai Yang’s small hut, it had finally calmed down.</p><p>Looking at the sky, Kai Yang became depressed. Because Su Mu had come to cause trouble, he had lost precious time to practise the tempered body record. It was truly regrettable.</p><p>Taking out his spare pair of clothes, Kai Yang then went to the small pond beside his hut. Taking off his tattered clothes, he prepared to take a bath. These past few days he had been wondering the mountain and then he had fought the flower patterned spider, these two things combined had really made him smell funny.</p><p>Stealthily, Xia Ning Chang tip toed to the side of the hut, for she wanted to learn the true level of this fellow disciple. Yet when she turned the corner, all that met her eyes were a pair of white buttocks. Kai Yang had already become stark naked, not a stitch of clothing remained and he was in the position to dive into the water.</p><p>Xia Ning Chang’s small face immediately flushed a bright red. Although her cultivation was very high, she was still an innocent female. Not even mentioning buttocks, she hadn’t even seen a male’s thigh. How could she possibly endure this scene?</p><p>Too provoking! Xia Ning Chang’s heart had begun to thump erratically and she quickly hid herself.</p><p>How…. she today………why did they have this fate? Tears streamed down that pitiful girl’s face, there was no time to find out his secret. Stamping her foot, she disappeared in a flash.</p><p>That stinking disciple. Those entrance examinations conducted by the teachers were too lax. Disciples stripping stark naked in broad daylight is too shameless. Far too shameless!</p><p>In the pond, Kai Yang was washing his body and inspecting it.</p><p>He had discovered that ever since he started to practise the tempered body record, his muscles had become sturdier and more robust. Although he was still thin, he was thin in the right places.</p><p>Additionally, the wounds from yesterday’s battle with the flower patterned spider had already become scars. Only the arm wound from the flower patterned spider’s leg had yet to fully heal; it was still a bit painful.</p><p>After all, it had penetrated through his arm, so it couldn’t possibly heal that quickly. But it wasn’t as severe as he had imagined, give it a few days and should be completely healed.</p><p>Thinking over that life and death battle with the spider, caused Kai Yang to be excited. Not knowing why, the more dangerous the situation he was in, the more enthusiastic and excited he became. He unexpectedly had this type of character, was he unconsciously a masochist and after living a bit more than ten years, he had suddenly awakened?</p><p>When he thought of that, he promptly inhaled a large breath and submerged himself in the pond; not resurfacing for awhile.</p><p>Although there were many things for him to complete, Kai Yang still went to take a shower. After dressing himself, he began his sweeping.</p><p>Afterall, this was his assigned work in Sky Tower. And since he was assigned this job, he must complete it to the best of his ability.</p><p>While sweeping, Kai Yang clearly felt that the gazes from his fellow disciples were strange. They were full of doubt, for they were the ones who had witnessed his battler earlier in the morning. They didn’t understand why Kai Yang had been able to knock Zhou Hu unconscious.</p><p>Kai Yang calmly and honestly continued with his work.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>Completing his sweeping, Kai Yang returned to his wooden hut and opened his bag. From within, he took out the herbs he had collected, keeping the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass out and placing the other extra herbs back into the bag.</p><p>These extra herbs were completely useless to Kai Yang, but he can sell them to the Contribution Hall for some contribution points.</p><p>Wrapping up the herbs he started to leave before stopping. Thinking again, he went back and changed his clothes, wearing his tattered, bloodstained ones he also dirtied his face bit before leaving again.</p><p>In the Contribution Hall, Treasurer Meng was sitting behind the counter while holding a teapot. Crossing his legs while sipping the tea he merrily hummed a tuned.</p><p>Suddenly a human figure could be seen at the hall entrance. Old man Meng boredly lifted up his head to see, and just as he was about to scold that brat which dared to come here his eyes widened. So early in the morning and someone dared to disturb his peace and quiet. Yet when he saw Kai Yang battered and exhausted walking in. His tattered clothes which could no longer be considered clothes, his two legs were clearly seen, and so were his leg hairs.</p><p>(TL: Yea, I’m confused as you are, leg hairs……O.o)</p><p>The two female disciples at the entrance saw this and shrieked out in shock at this vagabond, quickly retreating.</p><p>How was Treasurer Meng’s self control? After entering the mountain, then descending into the seas, he would remain impassive. Even if there was a massacre of ten cities. Yet at that moment, he sprayed out his mouthful of tea; you could imagine the scene.</p><p>“Little Kai Yang, what is with your appearance?” Old man Meng nearly went into a frenzy, quickly standing up. Dumbstruck, he looked at Kai Yang.</p><p>Rushing to the counter, Kai Yang then inhaled a large gulp of air before replying: “I have returned!”</p><p>“Experienced many hardships right?” Treasurer Meng felt pity for Kai Yang. Just a few days ago when he had come to his place, he was still healthy, yet from a single trip to Black Wind Mountains, he had become like this. He was not like a human or even a ghost, this was too tragic.</p><p>“En, I was in danger.” Nodding his head, Kai Yang didn’t waste anymore words. Hurriedly he opened up his bag and pointed to the herbs inside: “But my harvest was not bad, Treasurer Meng, will the Contribution Hall accept these herbs?”</p><p>Looking at the herbs, Treasurer Meng’s eyebrows rose.</p><p>They were only ordinary grade lower level herbs, and practically had no worth. These herbs were too plentiful in the Contribution hall, even if he accepted, there would be no place to put them.</p><p>Just as he was about to reject the herbs, Treasurer Meng saw the expectation in Kai Yang’s eyes and then looked again at his attire. Seeing this his hearten softened: “Oh, we will accept. For every two herbs I will give you one contribution point.”</p><p>“Okay, then please count them.” Without bargaining, Kai Yang pushed the bag forward.</p><p>Treasurer Meng went to count the number of herbs. There were thirty-two herbs, a total of sixteen contribution points. Immediately he went to record this into his account book.</p><p>“You were in Black Wind Mountains for an entire three days, yet you only found this much?” Treasurer Meng causally asked.</p><p>“Being able to obtain this is considered good.” Kai Yang said while carefully looking around.</p><p>“Keke, it’s not bad.” Treasurer Meng couldn’t bear to pour cold water on Kai Yang, after all he knew of the difficulties he faced. Although this child’s natural aptitude was not good, he was willing to work hard. Nowadays, these types of hardworking youngsters are a rare sight. It’s such a shame, his aptitude was so poor that it was a fatal downside, for it destined him to have no major achievements.</p><p>As he was thinking about this, he saw how Kai Yang’s eyes were darting around and couldn’t help but ask he curiously: “What are you looking at?”</p><p>Mysteriously, Ki Yang leaned forward and said in a low voice: “Treasurer Meng, in this trip to the mountain I seem to have found some incredible thing.”</p><p>Seeing Kai Yang’s cautiousness, Treasurer Meng also felt that this thing was something uncommon. He also became more serious and said in a low voice: “What thing?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I have brought it back to let you see it. You are experienced and knowledgeable, so you should definitely be able to recognise it.” As he said this, he went to touch his butt and took out a another bag. Carefully he placed it on the counter.</p><p></p>'),(158,7,'Chapter 24  Earth Grade Lower Level Blood Mushroom',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Treasurer Meng looked up and saw Kai Yang’s face held both anticipation and nervousness. He couldn’t help but become cautious too. Softly and gently he opened the bag, squinting his eyes at the contents inside.</p><p>It was about the size of a bowl, dark-red coloured, shaped like a mushroom, like a fungus. It really looked unordinary, with a heaven and earthly type aura.</p><p>“Ke…….keke……..” Treasurer Meng couldn’t help but cough a couple of times.</p><p>Nervously Kai Yang looked at him and questioned him: “What thing is this?”</p><p>Treasurer Meng looked at him queerly, and instead of replying, he asked: “Where did you find this?”</p><p>“Inside a cave in the mountain. There was also a first realm demonic beast guarding it. But instead of me being killed by it, it was killed by me, so I took it with me.”</p><p>Treasurer Meng’s heart jumped out: “You met with a demonic beast? Didn’t I tell you not to go past the safety boundary?”</p><p>“I didn’t go past the safety boundary. I didn’t know why it was in the safe zone area around Black Wind Mountain either.” Kai Yang replied in grievance.</p><p>Treasurer Meng sighed, he had thought something like this must have happened. It was just he was afraid that with this child’s strength, defeating a demonic beast, even one at the first realm must have been a very arduous task.</p><p>This pitiful one, at such a young age he has already suffered so many untold hardships while in Black Wind Mountains for only three days. And this work had only earned him sixteen contribution points. He even met with a first realm demonic beast, an encounter in which he nearly lost his life. If he was to tell him that his thing was, this things was…….ah this is too wrong, too wrong.</p><p>Anyway, this old man rarely does a good deed, just think of it as karma.</p><p>When Kai Yang saw Treasurer Meng’s face changing, yet Treasurer Meng not replying, it made him somewhat anxious. Just as he was about to ask him again, Treasurer Meng picked up the teapot and drank from it. Afterwards, he squeezed out a smile and said: “You little brat, your luck isn’t bad!”</p><p>As soon as he heard this, the worry in Kai Yang’s heart immediately dissipated. He was worried that when he went to ask, this thing would end up being worthless, that would have been embarrassing.</p><p>“Treasurer, what is this exactly? How many contribution points is it worth?” Rubbing his hands together in expectation Kai Yang asked.</p><p>“Oh………this thing is called a blood mushroom! It is a rare medicinal ingredient, it is an ordinary……..” Before he finished what he was saying, he looked at Kai Yang’s falling face and hurriedly went to correct himself. “No no no, it’s an earth grade lower level herb. En, it’s really earth grade lower level! That’s right!”</p><p>Such a firm tone was used that Treasurer Meng nearly fooled himself into thinking that it was true.</p><p>“Earth grade lower level?” Kai Yang was pleasantly surprised: “Treasurer Meng are you sure you didn’t see incorrectly?”</p><p>Straightening his face, Treasurer Meng replied: “You must be joking. In this old man’s life, he has inspected many women…..keke, inspected many herbs. This pair of experienced and knowledgeable eyes, how could they possibly be wrong?”</p><p>“How many contribution points can it be exchanged for?” Kai Yang was only interested in this.</p><p>“Let’s make it twenty.”</p><p>“That’s so little.” Kai Yang was somewhat disappointed. Even though its ranks wasn’t that high, he thought it was at least high enough to make it worth at least twenty to forty contribution points.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>“It’s not too little child.” Treasurer thought to himself that he had given him too much already. He then found a good reason for this: “Even though this blood mushroom that you found is an earth grade lower level herb, it is too small and its age isn’t that high. So that’s why it’s only worth twenty contribution points.”</p><p>“Oh.” Without refuting he accepted: “Then twenty points it is.”</p><p>Nodding his head, Treasurer Meng recorded down the transaction down in his account book again.</p><p>This trip to the mountains had already satisfied his goal of obtaining the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass. Apart from that, it had earned him thirty-six contribution points. If he added his already obtained points, then he has a total of forty-eight contribution points. Kai Yang momentarily felt himself become rich and powerful.</p><p>Although this trip into the mountains earned him quite the contribution points from the herbs, it had delayed and wasted precious time to cultivate. He had also needed luck to find the herbs and the whole trip had made him very tired. Kai Yang decided that other than as a last resort, he wouldn’t do it again.</p><p>(ED: How did it waste time to cultivate… he only needs to do it for 30 mins in the morning and he managed that just fine in the mountains…..)</p><p>The reason why he was collecting contribution points, was to aid him in his cultivation. Between these two things, contribution points and cultivation, Kai Yang still knew which was more important; he didn’t lose sight due to greed.</p><p>Now he has collected a decent amount of Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower. He had collected around thirty-forty of them in the cave, however the amount of Dead Jedi Tree Grass he had managed to collect was very small. He only had around five-six of them. If he really wanted to cultivate with them, then he must exchange some points for them at the Contribution Hall; he was well prepared for this.</p><p>With his plan in mind, Kai Yang said: “Treasurer Meng, please give me ten Dead Jedi Tree Grass herbs.”</p><p>Old man Meng looked at Kai Yang and wondered why he needed these herbs, however he didn’t ask any questions. He only sat and stated: “Ten ordinary grade lower level herbs, ten contribution points. Are you sure you want them?”</p><p>Scrunching up his eyebrows in suspicion, Kai Yang asked: “That’s not right. Didn’t you just say two herbs needed to be exchanged for one contribution point?” </p><p>“The buying price is the buying price, while the selling price is the selling price. They are not the same.” Treasurer Meng smile was especially wide, the demeanor of a businessman was coming out.</p><p>Furious, Kai Yang pointed towards Treasurer Meng’s nose: “You are completely trying to buy at a low price and earn a profit. To reap a profit, this is too shameless. Did you let a dog eat your conscience?”</p><p>Waving his hand old man Meng replied: “It is not I who wants to reap a profit, but these are the prices assigned by the Main Gate. This is unrelated to me. All the prices within the Contribution Hall are unaffiliated with me, this old man is only in charge of selling and buying. How else do you think the Main Gate is able to provide for all three thousand of you disciples?”</p><p>Kai Yang was stunned, for there was some sense in his words. Afterall this was a business, without any type of profit by Sky Tower, how could all three thousand disciples in the Main Gate survive? Even if there one were suspicious that it was for a profit, at the end of the day, no one was forcing you to buy them. No one was forcing you.</p><p>“Then, do you still want the Dead Jedi Tree Grass herbs?” Seeing Kai Yang’s face full of pain caused Treasurer Meng’s mood to soar.</p><p>“I want them.” declared Kay Yang, as he clenched his teeth together. Sooner or later he will need to use these herbs and since he had decided not to go find them in the mountain, he can only buy them.</p><p>Turning around, Treasurer Meng went to the back hall and soon returned with the Dead Jedi Tree Grass. Kai Yang counted the number of herbs while Treasurer Meng recorded the transaction down.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>“Humph!” After eating such a big loss, Kai Yang turned around and immediately left the hall unhappy.</p><p>“Please come again when you have time.” Treasurer Meng called out warmly from behind.</p><p>Come often to be killed by you. Kai Yang finally knew where Meng’s nickname came from.</p><p>Three steps, two steps, Kai Yang frantically rushed outside. On his way out, a figure rushing outside nearly crashed into him.</p><p>These two people’s reactions were fairly fast, Kai Yang stopped immediately and so did the other person. A sweet and pleasant fragrance drifted over to Kai Yang.</p><p>Lifting his head, Kai Yang saw a pair of clear moon-like eyes staring at him, but he couldn’t see her face clearly. This was because this person had their face covered with a veil.</p><p>This was a female. Although he couldn’t see her face, judging from her skin’s condition, she wasn’t very old. She was probably his senior.</p><p>Nodding his head and apologising, Kai Yang then turned his body to the side; clearly signalling for her to enter first.</p><p>The opposite party looked distracted and suddenly turned red. Seeing this made his own gaze become evasive.</p><p>Seeing her flushed face, Kai Yang thought that this senior was quite shy. Swiftly he averted his gaze, as to avoid offending her.</p><p>Xia Ning Chang was embarrassed to death.</p><p>She didn’t expect to bump into Kai Yang in front of the Contribution Hall. When she saw his face, she immediately thought of her……</p><p>And recalled his……..</p><p>Suddenly her face became red and her temperature rose. Hastily she rushed into the hall, she didn’t even dare to lift her head up.</p><p>Seeing this scene was somewhat laughable, for such shy females were quite rare. Although there are many females disciples in Sky Tower, they were martial practitioners and were therefore more open-minded than normal. For someone like her to become red just from looking at his face, it was no wonder she wore a veil.</p><p>This senior was a little bit cute, it was just why was her body’s fragrance vaguely familiar, like he had already smelled it before?</p><p></p>'),(159,7,'Chapter 25  The incense burners magical effect',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>After she entered the Contribution Hall, Xia Ning Chang glanced back. When she saw that Kai Yang had already left, she let out a sigh of relief, for she still felt a little bit guilty due to the morning’s incident.</p><p>While her feelings were in a mess, she heard Treasurer Meng let out an ai~o sigh from the counter.</p><p>“What’s the matter master?” Xia Ning Chang asked.</p><p>“You were just pitying that child.” Treasurer Meng sighed out sobbingly. “He’s a good child; willing to endure hardships, he’s hardy, has a good personality, his character’s not bad…….”</p><p>When Xia Ning Chang heard the way her master was praising Kai Yang, she immediately grew angry. In her heart she thought that he had yet to learn of Kai Yang’s actions this morning. Not only had he striped naked, he had also sullied this disciple’s eyes and given this disciple of yours the fright of her life.</p><p>On and on Treasurer Meng went, causing her to be more and more infuriated. Unable to bear it any longer, she slapped her hand onto the counter.</p><p>“Pa!” The sounded resounded like something had been broken.</p><p>As he looked at her, his face contorted and he wailed out: “That was my earth grade lower level blood mushroom worth twenty contribution points…”</p><p>“This was a blood mushroom?” Looking at the already powdered mushroom on the counter top, Xia Ning Chang asked herself whether or not her master’s eyes were failing. How is this a blood mushroom?</p><p>“It’s not, it’s not. How could your master mistake it.” Treasurer Meng replied as he let out a soft breath. The powder on the countertop then floated outside, like an invisible hand had scooped it up and scattered in the wind.</p><p>“Oh that’s right. Why did you come to find me today?” Fixing his face, Treasurer Meng showed a rare face of solemnity.</p><p>“I broke through.”</p><p>His expression changing, he went to inspect Xia Ning Chang’s cultivation. Soon after he nodded: “Good, good. It seems like I didn’t see incorrectly, for only people of your physique are suited to this cultivation method. Come, eat this pellet to help stabilize your cultivation.”</p><p>“En.” After she took the pellet, Xia Ning Chang hesitated slightly before asking: “How is your injury?”</p><p>Laughing softly Treasurer Meng answered: “You don’t need to worry about your master. After so many years, there is not big hinderance.”</p><p>Brimming with anticipation and excitement, Kai Yang returned home to his small hut.</p><p>Today the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass were all gathered and ready to be used. The amount of each was also not small, so it should last awhile.</p><p>Now he had everything prepared, Kai Yang really wanted to verify, whether or not that incense burner could truly aid him in his cultivation.</p><p>The location of the wooden hut was in the most empty and desolate area of Sky Tower, practically no one paid any attention to it. Since this was the case, Kai Yang didn’t worry about having his secret exposed. Walking inside, he called out the black book and turned to page three. Then he extracted the incense burner and placed it on the bedside.</p><p>He then took out the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass. Afterwards he stuffed them into the burner and put the lid back on.</p><p>All of a sudden a faint scent, akin to a rare perfume started to disperse in the room. Breathing in deeply, Kai Yang began to analyse the perfume. Although the smell was a bit unique, there was nothing special about it.</p><p></p><div></div><p></p><p>However, from the holes of the incense burner, the perfume steadily poured out and entered Kai Yang’s nostrils. It was like small, snakes were purposely entering his body via his nose.</p><p>Within his body, it was like there was something more. In his flesh and blood, in his meridians and even in his bone marrow a feeling of numbness spread.</p><p>Kai Yang didn’t dare tarry. Carrying the incense burner, he ran outside to begin his cultivation.</p><p>Stepping out of his hut entrance into the light took him by surprise. For his foot felt like it was made of lead, it was far heavier than normal. In combination with this step, Kai Yang felt his strength rapidly decreasing.</p><p>Taking another step, he began to feel dizzy and wanted to collapse; perspiring madly, his muscles tensed. The recently cultivated atmospheric energy in his meridians bubbled about and his bones cracked.</p><p>Taking his third step out of his hut, his legs became soft and he fell to the ground. As he fell, Kai Yang’s hands let go of the incense burner and it rolled far away.</p><p>Hands on the floor supporting his body; immovable like a mountain, he gasped for breath. His chest heaved up and down as he took several deep breaths, his body continued twitched uncontrollably. His tendons, organs and bones expanded and contracted causing the pain to intensify as time past. Although Kai Yang wanted to howl in pain, he kept his mouth tightly shut.</p><p>His current condition was one of excessive exhaustion; one he had experienced many times previously. Thus Kai Yang was quite familiar with it.</p><p>But, he had only walked three steps out of his hut, so how did he exhaust all his energy? Not only was his physical stamina gone, his mental strength was also exhausted. It was like he had not slept for many nights, even his eyes had started to feel drowsy.</p><p>At this point, his three energies were all exhausted to the limit, and he couldn’t even move a single finger.</p><p>By this time, the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass’s side effects had started to take effect in Kai Yang’s brain.</p><p>The toxicity of these two herbs wasn’t very strong. They were weak enough that normal people could resist them easily, but the prerequisite was that they were healthy. Given the hardships Kai Yang suffered daily combined with his current condition, Kai Yang had trouble withstanding them.</p><p>He was afraid that inhaling the incense burner’s perfume was the reason this type of situation had occurred. Though, regardless of the toxicity of the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass, such strong side effects was something they were unable to produce. The mystery originated from the incense burner; it was able to amplify those two herb’s toxicity.</p><p>Ever since he had obtained the golden body, every time he practised he never became tired or exhausted. And since he was never tired, Kai Yang was unable to reach his limits. Being unable to reach his limits, he was unable to improve.</p><p>Though it appeared this was no longer the case anymore. He only took three steps, yet his all his strength had been consumed. But the effect of this incense burner was not as simple as enabling him to reach his limits at this stage, for in the future will there ever be any fear he wouldn’t able to train to his limits again?</p><p>Kai Yang always believed that a person’s potential was unlimited, and the important thing was how one uncovered it. Although natural aptitude could help a person mature, one’s own effort was crucial! So after all these years, even he knew his own talent was lacking, he diligently struggled and never gave up his drive to cultivate.</p><p>Thinking this, Kai Yang’s spirits were greatly lifted!</p><p>Gradually and with much effort, he used his hand to push his exhausted body up; his thighs strained so much that his veins popped out. Gritting his teeth, he slowly pulled himself up.</p><p>Almost all of his physical strength had been drained, his consciousness had started to become fuzzy once again. Yet his heart refused to give in, giving him a ferocious burst of strength and energy. In his entire life, he had never been this adamant about anything, he was adamant he would beat this!</p><p>Stand up! For the place you fall, will also be the place from which you rise! If he stood up he would have broken through his limits, he would have won!</p><p>Time had never flowed as slowly as it did now, both his feet had already been planted firmly on the ground. Legs slightly bent, fighting against the trembling, his desire to stand had not diminished in the slightest, he would do it even if it meant taking it as slow as possible.</p><p>Finally Kai Yang bellowed/roared out, for he had finally stood up straight. Staggering forward, he steadied himself and anchored his feet to the ground.</p><p></p>'),(160,8,'Chapter 1 - Prologue',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>I open my eyes, seeing a familiar ceiling, and turn my face to look at my computer that was on my personal desk, \"When did I get home?\" rising from my bed I start to think. My memories were scrambled and I couldn\'t remember anything...</p><p>\"Victor!!\" Suddenly I hear a woman\'s voice. It was an angelic voice, a wonderfully beautiful voice; and she sounded very worried.</p><p>\"Ugh... Who?\" I put a hand to my head when I feel it start hurting badly.</p><p>I lean on the bed and try to get up, but all of a sudden I feel my hand sinking into the material of the bed. I hear the noise of wood breaking and look in the direction of my hand; I see that my hand has gone through the mattress and broke the wood that supports my bed...</p><p>I quickly pulled my hand away and I looked, confused, at my mattress that had a hole in it \"What\'s wrong with me?\" I asked aloud, stunned.</p><p>I don\'t remember being so strong; did something happen to me?

It was like I ran a marathon and needed a drink of water! My throat was parched!</p><p>I quickly get up, ignoring the sounds of wood creaking from the floor and grab my bathroom door handle, attempting to open the door, but something amazing happens...</p><p>The door is literally ripped off the wall. I was shocked at this show of force but I don\'t have time to admire it, or even question how I was able to do it. I quickly walk into the bathroom and try to turn on the water tap.</p><p>As before, the tap broke when I tried to open it and the water started to spew out; I ignored it, and put my mouth into the water trying to drink as much as possible. I looked like a man who was lost in the desert and found an oasis for the first time in days.</p><p>I feel the cold water from the tap entering my mouth and seeping down my throat, but the water doesn\'t seem to satisfy me; I needed more. I needed something to satisfy my thirst, the water didn\'t seem to be working.</p><p>\"Calm down,\" I hear a woman\'s voice, it was the same voice that called my name when I woke up.</p><p>Suddenly, as if it were a misleading lie, the thirst I had been feeling earlier disappeared.</p><p>I fall to the ground and start to inhale and breathe heavily, \"Who\'s there?\" I asked out loud, but I didn\'t hear an answer. I take a deep breath and sigh, \"Just what in the name of God is happening?\"</p><p>I look at the overflowing water and realize I couldn\'t leave it like this. I carefully turned off another valve that was located near the floor and soon the water stopped pouring.</p><p>I sigh in relief and get up off the floor. I turn to look at myself in the mirror, and what I see surprises me: \"Is that … me?\"</p><p>I look a little taller, I have a well defined body with muscles in the right places, six-pack abs and muscular arms. What stood out the most in my appearance is the incredibly pale skin, it\'s like I\'m missing most of the blood in my body. I used to look like a dead creature from a disease that gave me anemia, an extremely inconvenient disease and in some cases deadly... But, this is another level... I look like I don\'t have any blood in my body, I also noticed that my face is more defined; and my blue eyes and black hair have gained more shine?</p><p>Did the former 21-year-old who was skinny and looked like a teenager, grow up to be an athletic looking man in just one night?

Why all the noise?\" I look towards where I hear another voice and I start to breathe heavily; my throat starts to get thirsty again. I look through the wall and see the image of a human, and I can see her heart beating in a very attractive rhythm...</p><p>I could see the person\'s entire body with a red vision, it was like the world around me had changed; and I could see the heart that was glowing a more vibrant red.

What was that noise?\" Hearing my mother\'s voice, I woke up from my inebriated state.</p><p>\"M-Mother...?\" I responded in the most normal voice I could muster; but, it was obvious that I failed.</p><p>\"Victor!? Open the door, what\'s going on?\" I look at my reflection in the mirror and notice that my eyes have changed to blood red.</p><p>\"Oh... Shit.\"</p><p>Realizing what happened to me changed me in many different ways, I started to think rationally.

If you have one of course.\"</p><p>Oof, I feel an arrow in my chest for some reason but, strangely, it helped me calm down. I grow a little smile; my mother has no mercy and speaks her mind, she\'s very honest. That\'s the quality I like most about her. Though, I won\'t deny that I am often irritated with her honesty; but living 21 years of my life under her roof, you get used to it.</p><p>Anyway, I look at the clock and see that it\'s morning. I need to go to college, but I don\'t think I\'m able to go out on the street right now, and...</p><p>I look at my room and see the mess I made, the floor was broken, the door was ripped out, the bathroom was flooded... \"I need to organize this mess\"</p><p>...</p><p>Two hours later.</p><p>When tidying my room, I found out several things about my new self. I had more strength, much more strength than I had previously.</p><p>Because of this change, I\'m having trouble controlling myself. Before I used X force and I could open my bedroom door without breaking anything, but if I use the same force now, the bedroom door will literally be ripped off the wall.</p><p>My senses like hearing, smelling, sight, etc. They\'re much more sensitive, my hearing isn\'t on the level of the comic book scout friend who wears blue and red and has the S symbol on his chest; that guy could hear the entire planet...</p><p>As far as I\'ve tested, I can hear everything that\'s going on in my house and in the surrounding neighborhood. It\'s annoying, I hear multiple voices at the same time and I can\'t discern who\'s who.</p><p>Because of that, I tried something. I focused all my attention on a porn video that I opened on my computer called \'The hardest game in the world\'.</p><p>Do I look stupid? Yes, but it worked. Men are easy creatures to grab attention from.</p><p>My sense of smell has also improved, but the only thing I can smell from several kilometers away is blood, I can\'t differentiate the scents either.</p><p>Another thing I learned is that I have another kind of vision. When I switch to this vision, the world turns red and I can see everything around as if there were no walls. And, in this world, I can see human silhouettes. When I focus on these beings, I can see their hearts glowing bright red.</p><p>I just tested this for a few seconds; I don\'t want to risk getting thirsty again.</p><p>And yes... I know shit happened to me... I became a vampire, or something like a vampire...</p><p>The features are very obvious, pale skin, red eyes, better physical conditioning, and an insatiable thirst...</p><p>Knowing this, I have a starting line in my reasoning.</p><p>First, let\'s see what weaknesses I have.</p><p>The most obvious weaknesses from vampire books are garlic, the cross of Jesus (or something related to god), sunlight, and I can\'t enter someone\'s house uninvited. Also ... running water?</p><p>Some weaknesses may seem stupid, but I need to test them all. First the cross of Jesus. I look at a necklace that is hanging on my computer screen, on that necklace there is a cross; I slowly touch the necklace and I feel ... nothing.</p><p>Hmm, next. Running water... Well, I drank tap water, I guess that counts as a no? I don\'t know. I need to go to a pool or river that has running water and test; let\'s leave this weakness for another time.</p><p>Next on the list is garlic, I remember I bought garlic pizza two days ago. I walk towards the small fridge in my room and pick up the garlic pizza I had bought. Smelling the pizza with my nose, I feel like throwing up, but I also don\'t feel anything else; like a sudden weakness or something.</p><p>I think the urge to vomit was because my appetite changed? I try to put the pizza in my mouth and as expected, my body instantly rejects the food.</p><p>I ran towards the bathroom and spit the pizza into the toilet.</p><p>\"How disgusting,\" I said with a nauseous face, \"Why do I feel like I\'ve eaten an out-of-date fish?\"</p><p>My stomach churns, and I feel like throwing up. I quickly started to inhale and take deep breaths, a few minutes later repeating this process, the urge to vomit passed.</p><p>In the future, I must test whether whole garlic has any effect on me. Thinking about it now, that was stupid... What kind of vampire would have weakness to garlic pizza?</p><p>Anyway, the next weakness is the sun...</p><p>I walk towards my bedroom window, which is located on the wall where my bed is positioned; I climb onto my bed and open a small gap in the curtain for the sunlight to enter.</p><p>I swallow my saliva, I am a little scared of disappearing. After all, the biggest weakness of vampires is sunlight, but, I need to know; and I think just putting my finger in the sun shouldn\'t cause any problems, right?</p><p>Slowly, I bring my finger closer to the sunlight. When there was only 1CM left until sunlight touched my finger, I stopped... No, I need to know; don\'t be a chicken, Victor!</p><p>I put my finger in the sunlight and... nothing happens. I don\'t feel my finger disappear, and I don\'t feel that intense pain that I expected...</p><p>I sigh in relief, I look at my window curtain and open it. As soon as the sunlight enters my room, I feel the sun bathing me in warmth and touching my entire body; yet, I feel nothing.</p><p>For some reason, I felt like I should praise the sun right now, but I\'m not going to do that. What if someone saw me?</p><p>I lie down on the bed and look up at the ceiling. \"With no other obvious vampire weaknesses, I don\'t want to try to decapitate myself or rip my heart out; I\'m not crazy enough for that.\"</p><p>\"... What am I?\" I say to myself out loud. This morning was weird. For some reason, I don\'t remember what happened yesterday and I woke up with the characteristics of a vampire. But, I also didn\'t have the obvious weaknesses of a vampire... Am I reading too many books?</p><p>\"But, Hey, at least I don\'t glow in the sunlight.\" I laugh at my own lame joke. I close my eyes, and slowly, I drift off to sleep.</p>'),(161,8,'Chapter 2 - Awakening',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>Night...</p><p>I open my eyes and get up from my bed. I hold my throat, feeling an unbearable thirst. This time I felt like I couldn\'t control myself; I feared for my family\'s life, that I would do something myself, an action I would regret forever.</p><p>I open the window, position myself at the edge, and jump.</p><p>I don\'t know how much force I put in, but I felt the window frame crack a little, and soon I was in heaven...</p><p>At night, I felt stronger, my senses increased. Before, I could hear my whole neighborhood, but now I don\'t know what the limit is. I also had no control over my feelings. I actually tried to control myself, but the bloodlust was holding me back; it was like I tried to drive a car, but I was too drunk to achieve any control.</p><p>I was freaking out from the smell of blood; I need blood... I need blood!! Without me realizing it, sharp fangs started to grow in my mouth.</p><p>I fell on top of a building, and felt the crash of concrete breaking, but I ignored it and ran towards the stronger smell of blood.</p><p>I don\'t know how long it took, my consciousness was almost fading, but I did my best to keep my consciousness active. I refuse to become an animal overpowered by thirst! Soon, I was in a dark alley. Slowly, my world starts to change to the color of blood, and soon I see four silhouettes.</p><p>Three men, and one woman, two men are holding the woman\'s arms, and another man is holding a knife to the woman\'s neck. I looked at the hearts of the three men as if watching prey; they looked just like my mother\'s, with the only difference being that the light of their hearts was weaker.</p><p>\"Hey, who are you? Get out of here!\" They said something, but I didn\'t care.</p><p>I looked at the woman, and realized she was weird. She didn\'t have a red light in her heart. Did she have a red light in her neck? For some reason, women attracted me more than men.</p><p>One of the men walks towards me with a knife in his hand, he approaches me but stops walking when I look at him. Without my noticing, a predatory smile appeared on my face, and in that smile, they could see that my teeth looked sharper than a normal human. My teeth looked like a shark\'s, teeth that could easily tear through flesh and bones, and that sight startled the three bandits.</p><p>The bad guys\' faces started to change, they looked like they saw their worst nightmare manifested in front of them.</p><p>\"M-Monster\" The thug who was holding the woman spoke, he tried to run away, but he couldn\'t; he was paralyzed.</p><p>My smile grows abnormally when I feel the fear of the bad guys. I walked calmly towards them, they couldn\'t get away. By the time they looked into my eyes, they were already trapped like pigs being brought to the slaughter.</p><p>With a display of supernatural speed, I appear in front of the bad guy with the knife. With a speed that he can\'t react to, I pierced his chest with my hand and pulled out his heart.</p><p>Holding the man\'s heart in my hand, I felt the heart beating in an attractive rhythm; but for some reason, the man\'s blood didn\'t interest me. I opened my hands and the man\'s heart dropped to the ground.</p><p>\"H-Huh...?\" The movement I made was so fast that the bandit\'s own body didn\'t have time to react to what happened. All the bandit saw at the end of his life was the predatory smile and red eyes of the freak that attacked him.</p><p>\"Hiii~!!\" The thug who was holding the woman screamed like a scared little girl and tried to get away, but like his friend, he couldn\'t run.</p><p>This time, I disappear in front of the thug and appear behind him and soon his vision starts to spin, it was as if he had lost his balance, but before the thread of life faded from his eyes, he realized that his head had separated from his body.</p><p>I grab his head and use my tongue to lick the blood off his face. After all, I was curious about the taste, though I didn\'t feel like drinking his blood, but soon my expression distorted in disgust. \" disgusting.\"</p><p>I spit on the floor in disgust, it feels like I\'ve eaten a bad hamburger. Now, I understood why I wasn\'t interested in these men\'s blood.</p><p>I look at the last bandit left, using my arm like a sword, I cut the bandit in half. The bandit looks down and sees his body falling towards the ground. In the end he can\'t even say anything.</p><p>I was intoxicated by the pleasure of killing and the smell of blood in the air, my consciousness was in a state in between wakefulness and sleep, from my perspective it felt like I was dreaming.</p><p>\"Hahahahaha\" I hear a woman\'s voice laughing, I look at her.</p><p>My vision slowly returns to normal, and I see a beautiful pale woman with long white hair that is tied in a ponytail that reaches the floor. She has vibrant violet eyes, a nice figure, modest breasts, and an ass big enough that it can\'t be hidden by the black dress she\'s wearing. Was she wearing a dress with a tie? Her outfit looked like goth cosplay.</p><p>She\'s also tall, just a little under my height. I don\'t know how tall I am now, but before my transformation I was 175CM, I look around 180CM now.</p><p>\"As predicted, you exceeded my expectations, Victor.\" Hearing her voice again, I suddenly remembered the voice from when I woke up this morning.</p><p>\"You-\" When I was going to question her about the doubts I had, she put her finger to my lips: \"Shhh.\"</p><p>\"You must quench your thirst first, my blood will tell you everything you need to know, Darling.\" Suddenly, she reached for the buttons of the dress she was wearing and started to undress, slowly she showed some of her neck.</p><p>Seeing that pale skin and smelling her a lot stronger than before.</p><p>I swallow hard… My senses were going crazy, all I wanted was to sink my fangs into her neck.</p><p>While keeping the flirtatious smile on her face she said: \"Come.\"</p><p>I hug her with all my strength and bite her neck. \"Ahhh~! You are being very violent.\"</p><p>I ignored what she said and started drinking her blood, it was the most delicious thing I\'ve ever tasted in this life. I felt like I was eating a 5-star dish made by the most renowned chef in the world; but it wasn\'t just that, I felt a connection forming, I felt her whole existence, it was a euphoric feeling, it was like a drug you couldn\'t stop taking. Her blood tasted so good.</p><p>\"Looks like you like my blood, that\'s good.\" She spoke with a flirtatious smile, I suddenly felt a bite on my neck.</p><p>Everything I was feeling from drinking her blood suddenly intensified. The blood tasted 100x better, our connection increased and we became one? It was weird, but it wasn\'t bad. Actually... It was really good!</p><p>Suddenly a set of memories started to enter my mind. I was in a place that I know well, this was the market I always go to when my mom needs to buy supplies. Apparently, I was seeing this woman\'s point of view.</p><p>\"Are you sure?\" A woman\'s voice asked, she sounded quite unsure.</p><p>\"Yes, I will make him my \'Darling\'.\" The white-haired woman spoke with a loving smile.</p><p>Suddenly the vision changed and I was in an abandoned building? Looks like the woman took me to some abandoned place.</p><p>She bites her finger with her fang, and soon the blood starts to drip, when the blood falls to the ground something like a magic circle forms. When she looks at the ground, I see my old body lying there, and, did I look hurt? My arm had a big cut like a wild animal had clawed me. I could tell that I would have died from blood loss at any moment.</p><p>When the circle formed on the ground, she bit her wrist. As soon as red blood started coming out of her arm, she brought her arm closer to my body, and let her blood fall into my mouth.</p><p>She sits on my body, lifts me off the ground, hugs me, then she says: \"Victor, you\'re going to be reborn; I\'m sorry about this.\" Suddenly, she breaks my neck!?</p><p>It stays connected to my body, and soon something happens. My body starts to regenerate at an unbelievable speed and the magic circle starts to spin on the ground. When my body stops regenerating, the magic circle suddenly disappears.</p><p>The woman displays a satisfied smile, \"Success.\"</p><p>Suddenly, I open my eyes, and I realize that they are blood red. I get up quickly and hug the woman, then I bite the white-haired woman\'s neck.</p><p>\"Ahhh~~!\"</p><p>I finish biting the white-haired woman and the memories of the other person disappear, or she just stops sharing?</p><p>Before I can figure out what happened next, the world around me starts to crumble and I wake up in the dark alley I was in earlier.</p><p>What happened after I disappeared?</p><p>\"Victor, do you want to kill me? You are already satisfied, right?\" She spoke with a playful smile.</p><p>I stop biting the white-haired woman and look at her, I have a lot of questions on my mind now, but first: \"What\'s your name?\"</p><p>The woman displays the most beautiful smile I have ever seen, \"Violet... Violet Snow\"</p><p>\"The violet ice flower? Fancy name, huh\", I commented with a small forced smile.</p><p>\"My family is quite peculiar.\" She laughed.</p><p>\"I bet it is\" I commented with the same smile, so I give my name too:</p><p>\"Victor...Victor Walker\"</p><p>\"The walking victor? That is very simple,\" she commented with a small laugh.</p><p>\"Well, my family are simple people\" I commented with a shrug.</p><p>Now that I\'ve calmed down, I look at the corpses and feel my stomach churn at the sight. I feel like throwing up, but at the same time my body refuses to let anything out, after all... I was just nauseous. It was like I had taken a long 24-hour car ride, and I needed some air.</p><p>I had mixed feelings about the situation, internally. I didn\'t care about the death of strangers, even though those deaths were caused by myself, but my rational mind knew that was wrong. But, honestly, I was just confused by everything that was going on, and I didn\'t care about those dead men.</p><p>Violet, seeing my confused face, proposes: \"Let\'s change locations.\"</p><p>I nod in agreement, she approaches me, and says: \"Try to follow me, I\'ll slow down.\"</p><p>Violet suddenly, with a small impulse, jumps towards the building\'s roof. I try to do the same, but the ground around me ends up breaking. Looking at this, I realize how I have no control of my strength; leaving it aside for now, I start following Violet.</p><p>I know she was the woman who made me what I am now; I should be suspicious of her, but for some reason, I can\'t do it. It\'s just a feeling, but I feel like I\'ve met this woman once in the past, I just don\'t remember when.</p><p>Well, baby steps...one baby step at a time, I know absolutely nothing right now to make a decision. For now, let\'s follow this beautiful vampire.</p><p>…</p><p>Info:</p><p>The sociopath is a term used to describe someone who has an antisocial personality disorder. People with this disorder, also called sociopathy, lack empathy. They cannot understand the feelings of others</p><p>The functional Sociopath designates a person who, despite suffering from sociopathy, has this situation under control, ie, the effects of sociopathy do not greatly affect their interaction with other people.</p>'),(162,8,'Chapter 3 - Violet Snow',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>I accompanied Violet to a mansion similar to those you would only see in movies, the place was absurdly huge; how many rooms does this place have? Just from the size of the garden and the statue of a woman in the middle of the garden, I realize this place must have cost a lot of money.</p><p>The moment I tried to enter Violet\'s house, I was prevented from entering? Soon I remember the weakness of vampires who can\'t enter other people\'s houses without being invited… It seems I have that weakness too.</p><p>Violet looks at me for a moment just as a woman who was dressed as a French maid appears, the moment the woman enters my vision, I realize she\'s not a vampire.</p><p>She has blond hair tied back in a ponytail, blue eyes and a modest body, she looked to be between 21 and 30 years old. Her height was a little short, I think she was 170 CM?</p><p>\"Miss Violet, I see you have brought a guest.\" The maid spoke in a neutral tone that held no feeling.</p><p>\"Natalia, can you invite him in?\" Violet spoke in a friendly tone.</p><p>\"Yes, Miss Violet.\" She said while looking at Violet.</p><p>\"You can enter.\" When the maid spoke these words, I felt as if a force that was preventing me from entering had disappeared.</p><p>\"Come on, Victor. You must have a lot of questions, right?\" Violet spoke with a gentle little smile.</p><p>I nod in agreement, I walk towards Violet and start to follow her. While I was walking towards Violet, I felt the maid look at me like she was sizing me up or something.</p><p>Passing the maid, Violet and I walk towards a living room, she points to a plush-looking sofa and asks me to sit down.</p><p>I nod my head in agreement; as I take a seat on the couch, I see Violet walking up beside me and sitting down next to me.</p><p>Hmm, her scent... Her scent is very alluring... I shake my head several times in an attempt to control my impulses.</p><p>\"Heh, you are controlling yourself very well despite being a newborn.\" She commented with a small surprised smile. \"I was thinking you would jump on me and ravage me on this couch for all the servants in this mansion to see... too bad\"</p><p>This woman... I feel my eyes twitch a little when I hear what she says.</p><p>\"Although I find that offer attractive, I\'m not an exhibitionist, and I want answers\"</p><p>\"You\'re honest, huh?\" She blinked a few times as she responded with a pretty smile.</p><p>\"Try to live with a woman who only speaks her mind for 21 years of your life, you will inevitably pick up on some of her traits.\" I spoke with a shrug, for some reason I felt the temperature around Violet start to warm up?</p><p>\"Heh, I wonder who this woman is\" She spoke as her eyes were hidden by her hair.</p><p>\"She is my mother, of course\"</p><p>Suddenly the temperature around her started to return to normal, and Violet looked up smiling. \"Oh, she\'s your mother; of course, she\'s your mother, I forgot you had a mother.\" She nodded her head several times as if she understood something very important. \"And you\'re also a virgin so, of course, you don\'t have a girlfriend!\"</p><p>\"How do you know I...?\" I looked at her in disbelief, how does she know I didn\'t have girlfriends?</p><p>\"Oh, only humans who are virgins can be turned into vampires, that\'s why I know you\'re a virgin.\"</p><p>That\'s not what I wanted to know, but whatever.</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>This is new to me, I thought vampires could turn any human into a vampire, but there is this restriction. Huh?</p><p>Realizing I was silent thinking about something, Violet starts talking. \"Before I start explaining, you know what we are, right?\"</p><p>I honestly answer: \"A vampire... Or something like a vampire\"</p><p>\"Oh? Why do you think that?\"</p><p>I organize my thoughts and respond, \"First of all, I don\'t have the weaknesses of movie vampires like for example; garlic, sunlight, running water, the cross of Jesus, etc.\"</p><p>For some reason, Violet opens her eyes wide when she hears what I said.</p><p>\"And I\'ve never seen a vampire with the ability to see the \'red world.\'\" Of course I was talking about the movies I\'ve watched, but Violet seems to ignore that.</p><p>\"Red world?\" Violet asked.</p><p>I elaborate, \"For some reason, when I\'m excited by the smell of blood, the way I see the world changes and turns red. In this world, the walls seem to cease to exist, and I just see a plain with various silhouettes of the humans. And, when I look at the hearts of humans, I can see their red hearts beating like they are inviting me to drink that person\'s blood. For lack of better names, I call that world the red world.\"</p><p>I guess I should call it vampire vision in the future? But that\'s not right, after all it seems to be my power alone... Hmm, I\'ll think about that later.</p><p>I look at Violet, precisely speaking, I look at Violet\'s neck, \"But you\'re the only one who is different, when I look at you with that vision, I can only see your neck glowing red.\"</p><p>Violet looks at me like she\'s looking at a rare animal. \"As I thought! It seems like it was the right decision to turn you into a vampire; you are more special than I thought! And, you also inherited my characteristics.\" she said, excitedly, as she hugged me.</p><p>\"Woman, explain to me what\'s going on!\" I said as I pulled her face away from my neck, this woman is thirsty for blood!</p><p>Cough!</p><p>Viole pretended to cough and leaned away from me, she assumed a noble woman\'s posture and started talking; this posture would be more convincing if she wasn\'t in my lap, but I\'m not complaining: \"Let\'s start at the beginning, there are two kinds of vampires in this world, the noble vampires I\'m a part of, and the plebeian vampires that you\'ll one day meet.\"</p><p>\"The two species are the same, but at the same time different. For example: noble vampires can have children and, without exception, the noble vampire\'s child will have the same characteristics as his noble father or mother, with the only difference being that the characteristics of the child will be much stronger.\"</p><p>\"The Snow family has the fire trait, we can control fire and we have full immunity to the sun. Normally this trait wouldn\'t be passed on to other vampires my family has raised, but you seem to be different.\" she said in a happy tone.</p><p>I opened my eyes a little... \"That means I inherited...\"</p><p>\"Yes, you inherited my trait, all vampires without exception have a weakness to the sun. Only a few families have a certain resistance to sunlight, but only my family has full immunity to sunlight.\"</p><p>I swallow hard for a moment when I think of the bullshit I\'ve done: \"Just out of curiosity what happens when a normal vampire is bathed in sunlight?\"</p><p>Violet smiled gently. \"They turn to ashes.\"</p><p>Jesus Christ... That was close, really. I almost turned to volcanic ash... But \'Snow\', huh? The characteristic of her family is the opposite of the meaning of her name.</p><p>\"Just like I said before, my family\'s characteristic is to control fire.\" She raises her hand and a fireball appears in her hand.</p><p>\"My family is very feared in the vampire world. After all, with a small ball of fire, we can burn a vampire to ash.\" She spoke with a predatory smile full of shark-like teeth.</p><p>\"What\'s the difference with \'plebeian\' vampires?\" I asked.</p><p>\"They can\'t have children, and they get characteristics according to their personality. The plebeian vampires are usually the vampires that the noble vampires have created.\"</p><p>\"...So, I\'m a plebeian vampire?\" I asked, confused. After all, I wasn\'t born a vampire.</p><p>\"Yes, and no.\" Violet spoke.</p><p>\"You were born a plebeian vampire, but since you inherited my trait, that makes you a noble vampire.\"</p><p>\"Remember that red world you talked about?\" She spoke in a sensual tone as she breathed close to my ear.</p><p>\"Yes\" I reply in a flat voice trying to ignore her teasing.</p><p>\"That\'s your plebeian vampire trait, you gained that trait when I turned you into a vampire. Do you remember your immunity to sunlight?\" She asked as she licked my ear.</p><p>When Violet licked my ear, it felt like a surge of electricity went through my entire body. Feeling Violet\'s panties rubbing against my little brother, I can\'t help but get excited.</p><p>\"…Yes\" I replied a little breathlessly, I didn\'t even realize I had held my breath.</p><p>\"You inherited this trait from me, normally that\'s not possible, but you\'re special; your blood is special.\" She licked my neck.</p><p>\"Just because you have full immunity to sunlight, that makes you a noble vampire of House Snow.\"</p><p>Am I special? Is my blood special? What the hell is this woman talking about?</p><p>Despite being aroused and my urges freaking out telling me to bite Violet, I could still think somewhat clearly.</p><p>\"Let\'s save the boring explanation for later\" Violet pulls away from me, I look at her face and see that it was a little red and she was breathing heavily. She was clearly turned on and felt bloodlust, she put her hand on my shirt and rips.</p><p>She opens her mouth and I can see her teeth transforming, they got sharper, just like mine. Her teeth seemed capable of tearing flesh easily, she bites me with those teeth that look like those of a shark.</p><p>I only feel the pain for a moment, but soon a wave of pleasure spreads through my body and I grab Violet\'s ass. I get up from the couch holding us and throw her back onto the couch, while doing all these moves, she hasn\'t stopped sucking my blood.</p><p>I rip off her goth dress and soon an elegant black bra appears, I open my mouth and I feel my teeth change and my vision shift to blood red. As I look around the mansion with my eyes, I see all the people hiding behind the mansion wall. It made me lose the urge to bite Violet, and a wave of annoyance began to spread through my body.</p><p>Doing the math, I see 4 female silhouettes and 2 male silhouettes, only one silhouette had their heart glowing red. I assume this is the maid I saw when I entered the mansion, the rest must be vampires.</p><p>For some inexplicable reason, I was annoyed, I was extremely annoyed. I know I\'m not an exhibitionist, but these emotions don\'t make sense to me, it\'s like a little problem is going up 500x because of my emotions.</p><p>I look at a silhouette that has a red glowing mark on its neck, I see that person\'s silhouette shiver for a moment.</p><p>A bloody atmosphere began to leave my body, and I spoke with an irritated growl, \"Leave!\"</p><p>I\'ve seen the silhouette shake several times, but the male silhouette clenches his fists tightly and remains in place.</p><p>Is it that annoying because he didn\'t leave? Annoying, irritating...</p><p>Noticing the irregularity in my emotions, Violet stops biting me and looks up to where I was looking with glowing red eyes. \"Leave.\"</p><p>As soon as she orders, the people behind the walls disappear.</p><p>\"Ignore them, they\'re just protecting me; my family is overprotective, you know?\" She giggled a little with her lips full of blood, she pushed me down on the couch again, and showed her neck, \"Eat\"</p><p>The feeling of annoyance begins to subside, and soon my impulses start to trigger again, and soon I bite Violet\'s neck.</p>'),(163,8,'Chapter 4 - An incredibly beautiful woman',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>\"I don\'t understand,\" I said out loud with my head in Violet\'s lap. After our blood-sucking session, I lay in Violet\'s lap while she stroked my hair.</p><p>\"What do you not understand?\" She spoke in a maternal tone.</p><p>\"My emotions…\" I said, then continued: \"I\'ve always been a calm, rational person… My mom always taught me to use my head in any kind of situation, but I don\'t understand why I\'m losing control of my emotions; it\'s a very strange feeling\"</p><p>Violet, who was still wearing a black bra, looks at me and flashes a small maternal smile: \"You\'re doing better than most newborns, don\'t worry, this is normal\"</p><p>\"This is normal?\" I questioned confusedly. In the vampire movies I watched with my dad, vampires always seemed to be in control of their actions. I guess I shouldn\'t take knowledge of movies to reality, huh? Well, I can\'t help but list them considering I watched a lot of movies with my dad; he was a hardcore movie fan.</p><p>\"Yes, vampires feel things more intensely than a normal human, it\'s because of this problem that we live in isolation with other vampires.

Vampires seem to be a problematic race.</p><p>Come to think of it, I accepted this situation too easily, huh? Well, it\'s no use crying over spilled milk. At least now, I won\'t suffer from constant anemia because of my blood type.</p><p>Suddenly, I hear footsteps approaching; I look in the direction of the steps and see the blonde maid again.</p><p>\"Miss Violet…\" The blonde maid looks at me and Violet for a few seconds, she looks at Violet again: \"Miss Violet, please dress appropriately, we have a visitor\"</p><p>Violet looks at the maid with an annoyed look, I realize she wasn\'t upset with the maid, she was upset with the guest.</p><p>I get up from Violet\'s lap and my eyes turn red, as I look toward the mansion\'s entrance I see the silhouettes of a man and a woman, and both their necks are glowing red.</p><p>\"Vampires, huh?\" I commented in a neutral tone.</p><p>Violet looks at me with her eyes shining, \"That skill of yours is quite useful, how far can you see?\" She looked like a child who found something very interesting, her eyes sparkled with curiosity.</p><p>\"I don\'t know, I\'ve never tested the limits of my abilities yet\" I spoke honestly.</p><p>Violet nods, a little disappointed, and gets up from the couch. The maid approaches a wall and gently pushes a part of it, soon a wardrobe of black clothes appears. But, for some reason, there are men\'s clothes too, and the men\'s clothes are also black...</p><p>\"Choose any outfit and get dressed, Victor. I had prepared the clothes for you beforehand, ahh~! I\'ve wanted to say those words for a long time.\" She speaks with an excited smile.</p><p>Choose any outfit? But it\'s all the same...</p><p>I look at Violet with a neutral face, when she gets close to the wardrobe, I can\'t help but think; A long time, huh? Just how long have you been watching me, Violet?</p><p>Suddenly a woman who is wearing a modern maid\'s outfit appears at my side: \"Lord Victor, please dress appropriately for the visitors; they may be lesser beings, or maybe insects, they may even be pigs who came here to be downcast, but you, as a noble vampire, must always dress appropriately.\" The maid spoke in a neutral tone that held no emotions, but I could feel her contempt for her guest.</p><p>I look at the maid, she has short black hair, black eyes, and her expression is always set with a poker face. Looking at the maid\'s features, she looks oriental and she\'s very short, she must be around 160 CM?</p><p>\"What\'s your name? And Lord Victor? Why are you calling me that?\" I ask confused.</p><p>\"This maid\'s name is Kaguya; and you are Lady Violet\'s husband so, of course, we, as servants, should call you with respect.\" she spoke as if it were obvious.</p><p>Hearing what the maid said, I open my eyes wide and quickly turn to Violet who is being dressed by the blonde maid. Seeing my questioning eyes, Violet displays the most beautiful loving smile I have ever seen, and says:</p><p>\"Unlike the movies you\'ve watched in the past, vampires have several restrictions on turning other beings into vampires. The first restriction you already know, the human must be a virgin, the second restriction was created by our ancestors, when creating a new vampire a ritual must be done. When the ritual takes place a magic circle appears on the ground, at this moment the vampire responsible for the ritual must choose whether the human they will transform will become the husband or slave of this vampire.\" She pauses, slowly her eyes begin to change to blood red, then continues:</p><p>\"When I turned you into a vampire, I chose you to be my \'husband\'.\"</p><p>So it was that magic circle I saw in the memories, huh? Unconsciously, my eyes start to change to red as I look at Violet and I can feel something I can\'t explain, it is like I\'m being filled with another life? It\'s a really weird feeling, but it\'s really good. It\'s the same feeling I get when I feed on Violet\'s blood, but at the same time different; I can also feel emotions that aren\'t mine?</p><p>I feel happiness, love, and obsession coming from Violet; these emotions are so intense that I feel overwhelmed for a moment.</p><p>\"Can you feel it?\" She spoke in a loving voice as she touched the area where her heart was, she was breathing erratically and I could see that the air around her was starting to heat up.</p><p>\"...Yes\" I said honestly, I try to focus on that feeling and I can feel Violet, I can feel all the emotions she is transmitting to me, but... unconsciously, I turn my head and look in a different direction than Violet and I can feel something incredibly faint? It was like I felt a connection somewhere else, an extremely weak connection, but I couldn\'t pinpoint the location of this connection I was feeling.</p><p>\"This is proof of our connection… From the moment I turned you into a vampire, you became my husband for all eternity, you became my \'Darling\'.\" I turn to look at Violet.</p><p>When she spoke those words, she had a crazy smile on her face; it was a dangerous smile. But, at the same time, I thought that smile was beautiful, a very beautiful smile indeed.</p><p>She definitely had a head problem, and I think that just for the simple fact that I\'m taking this very easily, I must have a head problem too? But honestly? I do not mind.</p><p>I display a small happy smile: \"It looks like I\'ll see you for years to come, so I hope you take care of me… Honey?\" The last word almost didn\'t come out of my mouth, after all, I didn\'t know if it was right; I didn\'t know what it was to have a girlfriend, much less did I know what it was to have a wife, but I felt it was appropriate to call her that way.</p><p>Suddenly Violet\'s smile grows erratically, she suddenly appears in front of me and hugs me tightly.</p><p>\"Yes! I will take care of you! My Darling!\"</p><p>It seems I triggered some kind of button in this woman\'s body, she started hugging me and sniffing me while saying \'Darling\', she dragged her hand all over my body like she was trying to possess me or something.</p><p>She looked incredibly adorable, unconsciously I started stroking her white hair.</p><p>Feeling my hand in her hair, she suddenly froze and stopped moving.</p><p>She turned her face towards me, as we were almost the same height I could see her face very close to mine. As I caressed her, I asked, \"What happened, why did you stop?\"</p><p>\"Hmm, aren\'t you annoyed, or irritated by my attitude?\" She asked in an untrusting voice.</p><p>\"Why would I be? I think you are incredibly adorable\" I replied honestly.</p><p>\"Ugh\" She put her hand to her chest, it was like she had been hit by something in her heart.</p><p>\"Yes, indeed. Lady Violet is definitely at a point of no return.\" Kaguya spoke as the blonde-haired maid approached Natalia.</p><p>\"Shh\" Natalia made a silent gesture to Kaguya.</p><p>Kaguya just nods.</p><p>I look at myself and realize I was wearing a black suit? I looked, shocked, at my appearance and at Kaguya\'s hands holding my old clothes, wait! That\'s my underwear!? How could I not feel her undressing me?</p><p>Kaguya made some hand gestures: \"I am a professional employee of Clan Snow, I would be surprised if Lord Victor could feel me undressing him. These hands have been trained to undress any man or woman no matter what gender; I must comply with my duty properly, as a professional maid I take my duty very seriously.\"</p><p>She spoke in a flat, unemotional tone, but I could feel an unshakable confidence in that maid\'s tone.</p><p>\"…Okay…\" I didn\'t know what to say. Actually, what am I supposed to say? I just thought that and turned to Violet, who was still in a state like she was dreaming, she was giggling in low tones as she spoke quickly, she seemed to be delirious.</p><p>\"She\'s definitely in a state of no return, I think I should notify Lady Violet\'s parents.\" Natalia said as she walked towards the door.</p><p>Well, isn\'t that interesting? A very dedicated maid, a blonde maid who doesn\'t seem to care about her master, and a quirky master. I think vampires are weird beings, huh? Although the blonde maid is not a vampire.</p><p>...</p><p>It took a while for Violet to wake up from her state of illusion…or I don\'t think she\'s fully awake yet.</p><p>We were in a different room, I was sitting on the couch and Violet was sitting next to me as she hugged my arms with a little smile on her face. She looked like a very respected noblewoman, (It seems like her attitude I saw a few minutes ago was all an illusion).</p><p>I look around and can\'t help but wonder how many rooms does this mansion have? This room looks incredibly similar to the one I was in, but I feel this room is different. For some reason I feel uneasy in this place, it\'s like I\'m being watched. I use my vision that changes my world to blood red, and I could see why I felt that way.</p><p>This room was surrounded by vampires, hmm, I did a brief count and there were twenty vampires? And they were all over the mansion; it looks like this place is bigger than I thought. I look down and see some red silhouettes in the basement too. I also see that the only human in this mansion is Natalia, and she was actually in the basement sitting with two more vampires, and she seems to be eating something?</p><p>\"Lady Violet, I didn\'t know you were... Hmm, dating-\" The vampire who was sitting across from me started to speak, but he was interrupted by Violet</p><p>\"He is my husband\" She spoke in a neutral tone that carried a lot of happiness.</p><p>\"…I didn\'t know you were married\" The man spoke.</p><p>I look at the man who is accompanied by a woman, he is a tall man of 190CM, with short black hair slicked back. He was wearing a white suit, and glasses. Overall he looked like a successful lawyer.</p><p>The woman, who was looking at me like she was looking at prey, has short black hair; her haircut looks like a Karen\'s and she was wearing a normal work suit. She\'s shorter than the man and must be around 170 cm tall?</p><p>Coincidentally, her name was also Karen.</p><p>Violet displays a small smile and speaks while her eyes are closed; \"Lucy, I don\'t think you should know something about my life? Why don\'t you go back to your mommy who gave you that feminine name?\" she spoke in disdain.</p><p>Damn, woman. That was wild, is it okay to talk like that to a guest? Not that I care.</p><p>Lucy gently adjusts his glasses as his hands shake a little.</p><p>Cough!</p><p>He pretended to cough and looked at Violet.</p><p>\"Lady Violet, you\'re right.\" He leans back on the couch and says, \"I came here for one reason only, I want permission to bring a lot of vampires to this town.\"</p><p>Oh? I start watching the man.</p><p>Violet opened her eyes and they were glowing red: \"Lucy, this is my territory, and I don\'t accept other vampires in my territory that aren\'t connected to my family. You know that, and yet you come to ask me about it? Are you looking for war?\"</p><p>\"I wouldn\'t dare, I intend to live for a few thousand years yet. I don\'t intend to offend Clan Snow for something small like this.\" He spoke with a small smile.</p><p>Violet remains silent and waits for Lucy to continue his words.</p><p>\"You know, Lady Violet, I\'m a very scared man. I\'m very scared of dying and, because of that, I need to defend myself; I don\'t want to die from a bullet in my head.\" He spoke while making exaggerated gestures.</p><p>Violet opens her eyes a little, she seems to understand what he was trying to convey, then she continued in a bored tone: \"The Inquisition\"</p>'),(164,8,'Chapter 5 - The Inquisition',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>\"The Inquisition?\" I speak to myself out loud.</p><p>\"Oh!\" Lucy claps his hands in a startled gesture: \"Lord Husband doesn\'t know what that is? How long have you been a vampire? Don\'t tell me you\'re a newborn?\" He spoke in a neutral tone, but it was pretty clear he was trying to tease me.</p><p>\"I didn\'t expect the princess of Clan Snow to have a plebeian husband, I think hell must be frozen by now.\" The woman next to Lucy said.</p><p>They\'re really trying to piss me off, but unexpectedly, I don\'t feel a thing about them. The feelings I have are something like this, do you care what a bug thinks of you? I don\'t care, and I think that\'s why I don\'t feel anything.</p><p>\"Is this your attempt to provoke me? Childish.\" I speak honestly.</p><p>\"Huh?\" Lucy exclaimed, a little surprised. I realized the woman was surprised too, but I ignored her. I think they thought I would be angry since, according to Violet, newborns are very likely to lose control of their emotions.</p><p>\"I would understand if you were a newborn who was talking to me, but you\'re an older vampire, right? Why are you being so aggressive? Are you menstruating? Or do you have a dick in your ass all the time? Is this woman not satisfying you? I think I should call Little Timmy for you.\"</p><p>\"Timmy?\" Lucy asked confused</p><p>\"Oh, you don\'t know the legendary Timmy?\" I spoke with an unbelieving expression, it was like I was looking at two rare animals. \"I guess that living for so long does not mean that you are a man knowledgeable in modern affairs.\" I spoke in disdain.</p><p>\"Let me enlighten you, my little lamb. Timmy is a church boy, he\'s two meters tall, muscular, and he loves to purge vampires with his holy wand, I think he would love to bond with you.\" I said with a small smile.</p><p>\"....\"</p><p>\"Pfft\" Violet inadvertently let out a small laugh for a few seconds, but soon she returned to her noble expression as she kept a small smile on her face.</p><p>Lucy\'s smile slowly began to break. Slowly, and as if it were a lie, Lucy\'s mask began to fall apart. \"Do you want to die, boy?\" He spoke with an angry and aggressive tone; in front of me is just an older vampire who is sadistic and likes to kill.</p><p>\"Oh? As expected from an older vampire, you\'re definitely getting senile.\" I sneered as I ignored Lucy.</p><p>\"Lucy, where do you think you are right now?\" Violet spoke with a small smile on her face that showed all her sharp teeth.</p><p>The air was suddenly heavy, Lucy could feel killing intent all over the mansion and small beads of sweat began to appear on his face, realizing the stupid thing he did, Lucy\'s expression does a 360-degree turn, and soon he starts to smile \'gently\'.</p><p>Cough!</p><p>He pretended to cough, and spoke in an apologetic tone:</p><p>\"I\'m sorry about that slip, Lady Violet.\"</p><p>The killing intent disappears as if it never existed, but the atmosphere of surveillance still lingers in the air; something tells me that if Lucy tries to do something, he won\'t stay alive for long.</p><p>Well, I must surely praise how quick he is at controlling his emotions, as expected of an older vampire I guess?</p><p>\"Violet, what is The Inquisition?\" I ignored Lucy, and spoke directly to Violet.</p><p>\"The Inquisition is an organization made by the Vatican Church; they train humans to hunt down the vampires that are causing trouble in the human world. They use blessed holy water weapons, and chant bible verses to cause permanent damage to vampire mind\"</p><p>\"Oh, so they are vampire hunters\" I said carefree. Why was I calm? Well, it\'s simple, there\'s no point thinking about a problem that hasn\'t happened yet; you\'ll just get stressed out trying to control the things you don\'t have control over.</p><p>And, at the end of the day, you become a paranoid and stressed person. The only thing I have to do right now is to learn more about this world and about the changes in myself. After all, I\'m still a newborn, a little fish that has just been born in a new lake.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Violet agreed.</p><p>I reach up to Violet\'s ear and say, \"I tested in my room that the cross of Jesus doesn\'t affect me, so am i immune?\"</p><p>\"You are not immune to church attacks, what you have in your room is just a normal item. The items used by the church are blessed by the Pope himself, the closest figure to god we have in this world.\"</p><p>\"So does God exist?\" I asked curiously.</p><p>\"I don\'t know, but I think so? After all, those weapons affect us.\" Violet replies, a little confused.</p><p>Church, huh? I can\'t help but think out of curiosity, the church has been active for millennia, so this organization that works for the church must have a lot of influence in the world.</p><p>\"Lady Violet, will you accept my request?\" Lucy asked.</p><p>Violet looks at Lucy and replies, \"No, this is my territory and I don\'t accept other vampires, even if the Inquisition is here; I and my family can handle it.\"</p><p>Hmm, I think this decision is wrong. I don\'t have much knowledge of the overall situation but one thing I can say is, I shouldn\'t trust Lucy. I get a tingling feeling every time I look at him. Oh, I already know.</p><p>\"Honey, why don\'t you give our friend permission?\"</p><p>\"Darling?\" Violet looks at me with questioning eyes.</p><p>I just smile at her, she looks at me confused, but she nods; like she\'s telling me to do whatever I want. Isn\'t she cute?</p><p>\"Lucy, how many vampires do you intend to bring into my wife\'s territory?\" I look at Lucy.</p><p>He evaluates me for a few seconds and responds: \"Fifty vampires\"</p><p>\"Oh that\'s too much, are they all your offspring?\"</p><p>\"Yes, they are my slaves.\"</p><p>\"I see, you want to protect yourself from The Inquisition, right? We accept your request, you can bring the vampires, but…\" I look at Kaguya who was behind the sofa, and say a few words then Kaguya nods and disappears, a few seconds later Kaguya comes back with the city map in hand.</p><p>I place the map on the table in front of me, and with the pencil Kaguya also brought, I make a big circle on the map.</p><p>\"Keep your minions out of this circle\" I said while showing a circle on the region map, this circle surrounds Violet\'s mansion and my house which for some reason was quite close to this mansion.</p><p>Lucy looks at the circle on the map and nods his head, he looks at Violet for a few seconds as if asking permission, Violet nods her head in agreement.</p><p>Soon, he got up from the couch and extended his hand: \"Thank you very much, Lord Victor. I am indebted to your generosity\"</p><p>I flash a smile and get up from the couch, \"Don\'t worry, friends were meant to be helped, right?\" I look at his hand and shake it in a friendly gesture.</p><p>I suddenly feel like he put more strength in his handshake, it feels like he\'s trying to break my hand, but he doesn\'t have enough strength... Isn\'t he an older vampire? He must be strong, right? Well, he asked for it.</p><p>My smile grows unevenly, my sharp teeth start to show, and soon I just put a little more strength in my grip.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>His hand is shattered, but everyone ignores it except Violet who was looking at Lucy as if she were looking at a dead man walking.</p><p>Lucy looks at his hand for a moment, then he looks at Violet: \"Until another day, Lady Violet\"</p><p>Violet didn\'t say anything, she just nodded her head softly.</p><p>Soon Kaguya escorts the two guests out of the mansion</p><p>I sit down on the couch again, and Violet climbs into my lap:</p><p>\"What are you planning?\" She asked as she wrapped her arms around my neck.</p><p>\"Bait, Lucy is my worm that will attract the big fish\"</p><p>Violet opens her eyes a little and then she flashes a smile, \"Aren\'t you getting used to this vampire thing a little too quickly?\"</p><p>\"Meh, vampires are no different from humans; after all, they were once human.\" I reply, then I continue: \"When I went to my mother\'s work in the past, I learned a few things from the politicians my mother defended in court\"</p><p>\"Lies and truth are a fine line, politicians have to live telling lies to get the jobs they have today\"</p><p>\"Lucy, he\'s a lot like these politicians, he\'s a scared fox; he wants to take advantage of every situation, you should know him better than me\"</p><p>Violet nods, \"Lucy is a vampire who specializes in bringing food to noble vampires, he has good ties to noble families.\"</p><p>\"By \'food\' you mean...\"</p><p>\"Humans,\" Violet spoke mercilessly.</p><p>So that\'s why The Inquisition is here, they are after Lucy. It seems that using Lucy as bait was a good idea. I need to know the capabilities of this human organization and though I can ask Violet to tell me, that would be useless; there is a big difference between seeing one person\'s capabilities in person, and someone else telling you about it.</p><p>I just nodded my head in agreement with Violet\'s words, but I felt a weird incongruity in my chest. Common sense is that I should care about this, after all, they\'re human beings, right? But why don\'t I feel anything?</p><p>It\'s the same feeling as when I see a newspaper or television, you know people are hurting but you don\'t care; I think seeing and experiencing tragedy is very different from just knowing it through someone else\'s mouth, huh?</p><p>\"Normally, noble vampires don\'t need human blood.\"</p><p>\"Huh?\" I don\'t understand now, isn\'t that against everything being a vampire is?</p><p>Violet looks at me: \"You can suck blood from humans if you want, but that won\'t quench your thirst. The noble species are a very strong type of vampire and, because of that, we need more blood than normal vampires. To avoid of us having to cause a mass genocide, we ask the witches to do a ritual where when we get married so we will quench our thirst with our partner.\"</p><p>Oh, that\'s why when I went crazy, I\'d rather drink Violet\'s blood than those men.</p><p>\"But there are vampires who get bored drinking their wife\'s blood all the time. Because of that, vampires like Lucy exist; they kidnap humans and take them to the noble vampires who want to taste \'new flavors\'\"</p><p>Got it, vampires are treating humans like cattle, huh?... Witches... For some reason, I smell trouble a mile away when it comes to witches.</p><p>\"Witches?\" I question Violet, I really know next to nothing about this world, huh? Although some things are similar to movies.</p><p>\"Witches are human women who, for some reason, acquire an energy called magic. They use that magic to alter some things related to nature. Do you remember the magic circle you saw in my memories?\"</p><p>I nod in agreement.</p><p>\"They were also created by the witches at the request of the ancient vampires\"</p><p>\"They\'ll do anything for money, they\'re mercenaries; if you pay the right price, they\'ll do anything for you.\"</p><p>Heh, mercenary witches... Interesting, I flashed a small smile as I started to stroke Violet\'s hair.</p><p>I feel Violet squirm in my arms, but I keep stroking her hair. Violet\'s hair is my favorite type of hair for women, long hair so I can stroke it as many times as I want, I feel like I will never get bored doing this.</p><p>Soon, Kaguya returns accompanied by Natalia, the blonde-haired maid. I also see that the vampires that were hiding in the fake walls were all in the basement now.</p><p>\"Lord Victor, I think that is enough, if you continue I think Lady Violet will die.\" Kaguya spoke in a neutral, emotionless tone, but for some reason, I could feel she was joking.</p><p>I look at Violet and see that she was a flushed mess, her breathing was ragged and she was looking at me with obsessive eyes, hmm. But I did not do anything? I just caressed her...</p><p>Looking out the window, I saw it was dawn, I have to go to college.</p><p>\"Looks like I have to go back.\" I said out loud.</p><p>Hearing my voice, Violet quickly wakes up from her drunken state, and looks at me, \"You want to go back? But what\'s the point of studying now? You\'re my husband, and everything mine is yours, you just have to live here with me!\"</p><p>I look at Violet: \"Calm down, I don\'t want to be a parasite that depends on my wife... I mean, it would be nice to let you be my SugarMama, but I\'m a vampire, not a degenerate.\"</p><p>\"Why are you going back to college then?\" Violet asked a little calmer.</p><p>\"Honestly? I was studying economics in order to get a degree and somehow help my family. After all, my family situation is not the same as when I was 15.\" I answer honestly, then I continue: \"I even got a job at McDonutus that pays me $15 an hour, I used that money to pay for my college, but...\"</p><p>I look at my hand, I focus my feelings on my pale hand, \"Now that\'s not necessary, there are several ways to make money with my current condition.\"</p><p>\"And I\'m not willing to abandon my family, if I\'m not close to my mom, she\'ll get bored. After all, with her personality she wouldn\'t make many friends.\" I laughed a little when I thought of my mom. Though I became a vampire, I don\'t intend to abandon my family and friends.</p><p>I\'m not going to act like an emo, and say that I\'m going to put my family in danger, and because of that, I need to abandon them.</p><p>I may have changed my race, but I\'m me, I make my own decisions. And, since I know there\'s a way I can\'t go crazy from bloodlust, the worry of hurting my family is practically non-existent.</p><p>\"So you go to college just because you want to?\" Violet asked me confused.</p><p>\"Yes, I\'m going to quit my job and go to college to enjoy school life a little. Because of my illness, I\'ve always lived in fear of trying too hard. Because of my illness, I couldn\'t enjoy much of my life, but that\'s not an obstacle anymore.\" I said honestly. I always wanted to play sports, I always wanted to swim, to play basketball, but because of my illness I couldn\'t do that kind of activity.</p><p>I look at Violet, \"Don\'t you want to come with me?\"</p><p>\"Huh...?\"</p><p>\"Well I want to introduce you to my family, you are my wife, right? You have to meet my family and friends.\"</p><p>I plan to invite her to live with me since, if Violet comes to live with me, there will be few things that threaten my family\'s life. After all, these vampires seem to obey Violet\'s every word, if she is living with me, that will ensure that my family is protected.</p><p>Violet displays a happy smile and starts hugging me again, I laugh and start stroking her head, she looks so happy.</p><p>\"Yes! I\'ll go with you! In fact, I\'m going to live with you! Let\'s go!\" She spoke happily as she got up and pulled me somewhere.</p><p>Well, it looks like I don\'t need to ask her to move in with me, she did it herself. I thought as I smiled satisfied.</p><p>\"Wait.\" I spoke in a neutral tone, Violet looked at me: \"If you want to live with me, you have to promise to protect my family.\"</p><p>\"Oh, is that it? That is something easy to do, few people would dare to mess with my family.\" She said smiling, then she continued:</p><p>\"My family is your family too, right? We are married! Of course, I would protect your family!\" She spoke with a proud smile.</p><p>I can\'t help stroking this woman\'s head, isn\'t she very beautiful?</p><p>\"Lady Violet was manipulated, right?\" Kaguya whispered in a not-so-low voice.</p><p>\"Yes, and probably, she doesn\'t even care about it,\" Natalia replied.</p><p>\"Sigh, we\'re lost, what if Lord Victor decides to get his hands on us?\" Kaguya spoke in a neutral tone with exaggerated gestures.</p><p>\"I doubt that would happen, he seems to have no interest in us, and Violet would probably kill us if that happened\" Natalia replied again in a flat tone.</p><p>\"True, a stalker\'s love is something difficult to understand,\" Kaguya said.</p><p>\"Shh, don\'t say that, what if someone hears you?\" Natalia spoke in a louder voice.</p><p>\"....\"</p><p>Are these women right in the head?</p>'),(165,8,'Chapter 6 - The most normal parents in the world',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>February 2nd, the day after Victor discovered the changes in his body.</p><p>I was walking towards my house with Violet clinging to my arm with a really big smile on her face. Currently, only one thing concerns me.</p><p>How the hell am I going to explain the changes in my body to my mom?</p><p>I look into the mirrored window of a building next to me. I was 175CM before I became a vampire, I was a very thin young man who looked very anemic, but when I became a vampire I grew 5CM in height.</p><p>I\'m 180 cm tall now with more defined muscles that stand out a little in the outfit I\'m wearing. My pale skin has turned a paler shade than it was before, while my black hair and blue eyes have taken on a brighter shade. Overall, I looked the same as before, with the only differences being that my body grew and my skin turned paler.</p><p>By the way, I was wearing casual clothes, a loose black shirt and black pants along with white sneakers from a famous brand.</p><p>Violet was wearing a black dress, it was a closed-neck sleeveless dress made of leather. The dress was a little short, reaching up to her beautiful thighs almost showing the flesh of her ass. For a moment I think I actually drooled, it was very sexy, especially glued to her body with her perfect curves.</p><p>When she saw my gaze she displayed a seductive smile as if everything went according to plan.</p><p>According to my wife Violet...the vampire transformation forces the body to its peak state and, as I am a newborn, these changes will only stop happening when my body is fully developed. She said that usually, it takes a week for the body to stop constantly evolving.</p><p>I look at the clock on my phone and it\'s currently seven in the morning. Normally this wasn\'t the time for vampires to be awake, but Violet and I were special so we just looked like a tourist couple from the North Pole or from some other area of the coldest parts of the planet, although I don\'t know if civilization exists at the North Pole.</p><p>Why do Violet and I look like tourists? Well, our pale skin color draws a lot of attention and, to my limited knowledge, humans who live in snowy areas of the planet tend to have paler skin color (I think? I\'m not sure, I wasn\'t the brightest student in geography at school). Anyway, we look like two tourists who have come from a very cold place. After all, no one would believe that two vampires are walking around in broad daylight.</p><p>When Violet and I stopped at a location that she was interested in, the salesperson asked if I was a tourist, and I said yes, I also said that we lived in a really icy area.</p><p>Surprisingly, he agreed with my words easily. Well I live in the United States Of America so I guess tourists around here are normal?</p><p>And Violet? I look at my wife, she seems to be having fun, she seems to consider walking back to my house as some sort of date or something. Apparently, she hasn\'t left the house for a few years, (she told me this by accident) and, because of that, she\'s curious about everything. She looks like a curious kitten, if anything catches her attention she stops walking and moves toward it, then, if she finds something interesting, she buys it and asks Kaguya, who is accompanying us, to take it. She was like a princess who went to the mall and bought everything she saw and liked… Rich people are different...</p><p>It wasn\'t until Kaguya came out into the sun that I found out she was from the same family as Violet. Apparently, she\'s from a family dedicated to serving Violet\'s family; she didn\'t explain much to me about it.</p><p>An interesting thing about Kaguya is that she is a vampire who only inherited immunity to the sun, she doesn\'t have control of Violet\'s fire element.</p><p>She seems to have an ability called \'shadows\'; basically she becomes one with a shadow and can walk in the shadows... This is a very broken skill, she can pretty much kill anyone at night.</p><p>\"Ugh, Lady Violet. You are buying too many things, the thin arms of this helpless young woman can\'t take it. I wonder if there is any man who can help me?\" Kaguya spoke in a neutral tone as she looked at me with bright eyes.</p><p>Who do you think you are kidding, woman? You? Helpless? Is this some kind of joke?</p><p>I just turn my face away and ignore Kaguya.</p><p>\"Tsk\"</p><p>Did I hear a \'Tsk\' just now? Shouldn\'t this woman be calm and cool or something? Is her mask falling off?</p><p>\"Hahaha, I\'m glad you\'re getting along with Kaguya, but…\" Violet looks at Kaguya, \"Don\'t get too close, okay?\"</p><p>She spoke with an emotionless face, I could see it was just a simple warning, but that it contained many meanings I didn\'t understand.</p><p>\"Yes. Don\'t worry, Lady Violet. I take my job very seriously.\" Kaguya spoke in a neutral tone that carried unshakable confidence.</p><p>Kaguya looked a little nervous.</p><p>I stroked Violet\'s hair: \"Let\'s keep walking, help me think of a way to fool my mom.\"</p><p>Suddenly, Violet becomes more docile, and says: \"Yes!\"</p><p>I look at Kaguya with a smug face, Kaguya just turns away and ignores me.</p><p>Seriously. Where is Violet\'s family finding these interesting people? It\'s been a while since I\'ve had fun like this, I thought with a smile on my face.</p><p>\"Darling, why don\'t you charm your mother?\" Violet spoke suddenly.</p><p>\"Oh, are you talking about that skill from the movies? Do I look at someone, and tell them to do whatever I want?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Violet nods her head as she continues walking with me. \"You don\'t need to do a very difficult one just something like, \'Ignore the changes in my appearance\'\"</p><p>To be honest, I was inclined to do that, but I feel it would give me a bad taste in my mouth to charm my family. Hmm? I look to the side and see police cars speeding past.</p><p>Vrummm! Vrummm!</p><p>The police were chasing a truck and, just for a few moments, I sensed a familiar smell. I decided this was a good opportunity to test my new senses, I take the cheap black glasses I bought and put them on my face (the glasses only cost 5 dollars), they were very big and unfashionable glasses and the lenses appeared to be very dark too, I bought these glasses for one reason only.</p><p>When I use my red vision my eyes change to blood red, to avoid drawing attention, I bought some big black glasses. After all, even though I\'m wearing glasses, I can still see with this special vision.</p><p>I switch to my red vision, and soon my world turns red, I focus my vision on the truck and realize there are 20 vampires inside the vehicle.</p><p>\"20 vampires, huh?\" I spoke in a low voice.</p><p>\"Can you see that far?\" Violet asked, a little shocked. She could do the same, she could look at things far away like she was looking very close, but my vision was more stable, and it wasn\'t affected by visible obstacles like buildings, houses, metal walls, etc...</p><p>This was a good skill for reconnaissance.</p><p>\"Yes. I think those are Lucy\'s subordinates?\" I spoke in a disinterested tone. I said it because I smelled the old vampire stench from those vampires that were in the truck; I only smelled it for a few seconds, but it was enough to recognize them.</p><p>\"Hmm, he\'s getting a lot of attention, if he\'s not killed by the Inquisition, he\'ll die by the claws of noble vampires.\" Violet spoke in a non-caring tone, she probably has some of her people looking into this matter.</p><p>Suddenly Violet stops walking and looks at a big bear that was being sold in a children\'s store... Just out of curiosity, I looked at the price of the bear, and it cost 25 thousand dollars, what the fuck!?</p><p>Isn\'t that just a bear? How is it so expensive!?</p><p>Violet suddenly starts running at the speed of a normal human girl, and enters the store.</p><p>Seeing Violet buying the bear and hugging it, I can\'t help but say... She\'s adorable, damn!</p><p>\"Kaguya, why are the nobles going to kill Lucy?\"</p><p>Kaguya, who was carrying Violet\'s bags, spoke in the same neutral tone. \"It\'s because he broke the rules.\"</p><p>Kaguya looks at me and says: \"Rule number four of being a vampire, never reveal that you are a vampire to humans; matters involving the vampire world should not be mixed with human affairs… This rule can be ignored if the vampire is contacting a human with the intention of turning the same human into a vampire.\"</p><p>\"If he breaks this rule, he\'ll be hunted by the Nobles and killed. After all, we don\'t like to draw too much attention\"</p><p>Said the woman who was dressed as a maid while carrying several purchases; if that\'s not attracting attention, what is? But, I understood what she was saying, this rule was basically a warning to younger vampires: \'Don\'t make too much of a fuss about vampires, or we\'ll go after you.\'</p><p>They were basically saying that.</p><p>Soon Violet comes back carrying a big bear and with a happy face, I can\'t help but pat her head when I see her like this.</p><p>Feeling my caresses, she shows a happy smile, then I say: \"Come on, we\'re almost there\"</p><p>The two women nod in agreement.</p><p>...</p><p>Arriving at my house, I open the door.</p><p>\"Mom, I\'m home!\" I spoke out loud.</p><p>\"Victor!? Son, why didn\'t you answer the phone!? I was getting—\" She trails off as she looks at me standing in the doorway along with two women.</p><p>\"Victor...?\" She approaches me suspiciously.</p><p>I look at my mom. She\'s going to be 40 this year; she has a little belly fat but, overall, her appearance is well preserved, long black hair, blue eyes and a curvy body. She keeps saying that lawyers who look good have a better chance of getting rich clients.</p><p>My mother\'s clients in the past were politicians with questionable résumés, they called these politicians \'fat lambs\' and she defended these politicians in exchange for large amounts of money. She not only defended politicians, she defended normal people and even companies that had suffered because of fraud, etc. She\'s a good lawyer, even if she defended corrupt politicians, in the end, it doesn\'t matter.</p><p>After all, work is work, does she defend corrupt politicians? Yes, but the money is good, and she\'s not doing anything illegal, even though she stopped doing it a long time ago (it was getting dangerous to work in that world), because of that decision she made in the past, she doesn\'t win as much money as she had before.</p><p>\"Strange…\" She spoke with a confused face, then she continued: \"I feel that you are my son, but at the same time, I feel that you have changed too much to be my son.\" She is still honest as always, she was standing in front of me looking at me with a face that said \'you can\'t fool me\'.</p><p>\"Sigh, when I was 13, you and I went out to a restaurant; we met your ex-friend, that woman you called \'Thot\',\" I started to speak.</p><p>\"What is her name?\" She asked.</p><p>\"Aphrodite\" I know her name is Renata, but my mom dubbed her Aphrodite.</p><p>\"That is still not enough!\" She spoke as if she hadn\'t lost a battle or something like that.</p><p>\"On my 21st birthday, you took me outside a brothel and said you\'d dump me in that place if I didn\'t find a girlfriend.\"</p><p>Violet suddenly looked at my mom for a moment, she seemed undecided about what to do; her eyes were glowing dangerously, but soon the light seemed to fade, it looked like she was going through an internal conflict.</p><p>Cough!</p><p>My mother pretended to cough:</p><p>\"Yes, you are definitely my son. By the way, you shouldn\'t say that out loud. What will people think of me if they find out I almost gave away my son\'s cherry just because I wanted my son to have a girlfriend?\" She spoke with a snort.</p><p>My eyes start to twitch when I hear what my mom says, but I can\'t help but smile in happiness. My mom is weird but she\'s a good mom, she\'s not \'normal\' like all moms of the world, but she is my mother and I love her very much as a son.</p><p>She approaches me and says: \"You\'re paler than usual, do you need food? And it looks like you\'ve grown too.\" she puts her hand on her head and starts trying to measure my height by comparing her height with mine</p><p>My mother\'s height is around 170 CM, she is a little shorter than my old height before being turned into a vampire which was 175 CM.</p><p>\"It\'s puberty, mom\" I said the excuse every man ever has told his mother at least once in his life.</p><p>\"Puberty...?\" She repeated what I said with distrust.</p><p>She looks at Violet and Kaguya.</p><p>Seeing how beautiful both women were, my mother started to enter her own world again.</p><p>\"Holy shit!! You popped your cherry and because of it you grew!? Kyaa! Wait a moment! I\'ll call your father!\" Suddenly she starts running towards the stairs, she puts both hands close to her mouth like she has to call someone.</p><p>\"Leon!! Get down here immediately!! I mean it!! Get your lazy, fat belly down here now!!\" she screamed.</p><p>Because of my new senses, I heard this scream louder than it should have been, and from Kaguya and Violet\'s stunned expressions I can tell they had the same reaction as me.</p><p>\"What is it, woman!? I am watching a movie!! I still have to work later!! I want to finish this movie before I go to work!!\"</p><p>\"Our son lost his cherry and brought two beautiful girls home!!\"</p><p>\"What!? Wait a moment!! I am on my way!!\"</p><p>Violet and Kaguya look at me, I try to keep my poker face as much as possible to hide my embarrassment, yes! Let\'s think about dolphins, dolphins are beautiful beings, and they have the intelligence of a human, umu! As expected, dolphins should be the rulers of humanity.</p><p>As I hypnotized myself, my dad started down the stairs.</p><p>When he appears in front of me, he looks at Kaguya and Violet, then he nods at me satisfied, \"As expected of my son, the mason genes are running through your veins, you\'ve got two beautiful girls! One oriental and one with a noble appearance! I was worried that you would be a virgin forever!\"</p><p>He totally ignored my appearance, didn\'t he!? Ugh, for some reason I have a headache, although I shouldn\'t have a headache, since I\'m a vampire and vampires have regenerative bullshit or something.</p><p>I look at my dad, he\'s turning 50 this year, he has brown hair and black eyes, he is 183 CM tall with a beer belly and muscular arms, he was wearing shorts and a white t-shirt.</p><p>He\'s a bricklayer, he works in construction, nowadays he\'s retired but he still goes to where he works to give advice or something, I don\'t really know for sure. I just know he\'s retired, but for some reason he says he\'s going to \'work\', I guess old habits don\'t change, huh?</p><p>Cough!</p><p>I give a fake cough and go, \"Violet, this is my dad Leon Walker, and this is my mom Anna Walker\" I say as I introduce my parents.</p><p>\"Nice to meet you,\" Violet says while performing in her noblewoman\'s mask.</p><p>\"Mom and Dad, this beautiful white-haired woman is Violet, she is my wife, and this black-haired woman is her personal maid.\"</p><p>\"...Huh...?\"</p>'),(166,8,'Chapter 7 - Daughter-in-law',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>At this point, I was in my house sitting on a relatively large and cheap couch, not that I care about anything like that, and Violet was sitting next to me while Kaguya was behind me holding the bear Violet had bought while she put away everything else that was Violet\'s behind the couch.</p><p>Right now I was thinking about the decisions I made about my family and, seeing the result, I think I made the right decision. My family is strange ... but I love my parents very much and, if possible, I don\'t want to hide anything from them. I know the vampire world isn\'t something ordinary humans can handle and, because of that, I made a deal with Violet to just keep the vampire world a secret, but that\'s only temporary.</p><p>After all, I know this kind of secret will bite my ass in the future. I learned a lot from reading hero comics, they always had this bullshit attitude of hiding things and, in the end, someone important to the hero died, but...</p><p>I need to learn more about the world of vampires. When I\'m ready, I will talk to my parents about this world then, after all, I want to give them this \'gift\' too, immortality... It\'s something everyone wants, and my parents are no exception, I guess…</p><p>And, I don\'t want to be alone forever; I know I would have my wife, but I can\'t imagine living without my bundle of joy that I call Mom… I would miss my father too, and his company when I watch movies...</p><p>Well, no use thinking about it now, this is something for the future.</p><p>\"So, you\'re saying you\'ve been in contact with Violet for several years and, just recently, you guys met and started dating?\" My mother, Anna, asked in disbelief.</p><p>\"Wrong, we became husband and wife.\" Violet spoke with a noble smile.</p><p>\"You skipped the boyfriend stage and went straight to the wedding, are you sure about that son?\" My dad asked, and I knew what he was thinking when he asked that question. He was probably thinking something like, you\'re so young! You\'ve got a lot of fish in your net to catch, are you sure you want to commit now!? Marriage is not a good thing, you know!!</p><p>I\'m pretty sure he was thinking about it since we\'ve had this kind of conversation in the past.</p><p>Although I\'m absolutely sure he said it just for the sake of it. After all, his happy smile has never left his face...</p><p>\"Yes, we have been dating online for about three years now and, when we first met, it was like love at first sight; I\'m sure I want to be with her forever.\" I say with a small smile as I confirm the story Violet and I created.</p><p>Violet\'s noble mask starts to break into pieces and she starts to smile happily; as soon as she hugs me tighter, my mother looks at Violet and shakes her head several times as if she has understood something:</p><p>\"I\'ve taught you many times not to be a Simp, and you\'ve been chasing this cute girl for three years? My son, if you liked her, you should talk on the first day!! You shouldn\'t wait for three years!\" My smile starts to crack and my eyes start to twitch.</p><p>\"Woman, I said forget about those topics. Simp!? You are being infected over the internet! Forget that word for the love of all gods!!\" I practically yelled, my mom is always up to date with useless stuff, seriously... Should I cancel this house\'s internet?</p><p>It\'s better that I not, if I do that maybe my mother will die...</p><p>My mom just looks at me and sticks out her tongue, she looks like a kid. It\'s because of that jovial attitude that she doesn\'t have older friends... Wait, I think Travis\' mom is her friend?</p><p>Travis is my childhood friend who lives two houses away from where I live.</p><p>My dad was dead serious, he looked like a politician who was about to make an important decision. Of course, that politician\'s important decision was probably about stealing income from a children\'s school, or stealing from another politician.</p><p>\"So, did you or didn\'t you?\"</p><p>\"Father!?\"</p><p>\"Did you or didn\'t you? You know what I\'m talking about, penetration of the sacred cave, drowning the goose, letting the dragon drink the divine nectar, double cultivation, etc. There are several names...\"</p><p>\"No need to be ashamed, at the end of the day, this is a normal act. No matter what society says, the act of drowning the goose is not a sin!\" He looked like a wise man right now, looks like he\'s reached nirvana or something.</p><p>My mom suddenly gets up and hits him on the head. \"Stop embarrassing our son, what if he loses his wife over this? Do you know how difficult it will be for him to get another woman!? Do not screw it up!\"</p><p>Mother!? You don\'t have any confidence in me, huh?</p><p>My dad makes an apologetic face. My mom looks at me. \"And...? Did you or didn\'t you!?\"</p><p>Woman, did you forget what you said a few seconds ago!? That thing about not embarrassing me?</p><p>Ugh. \"Can we just forget about it at once? Don\'t you have any other questions to ask?\" I spoke with a desperate face.</p><p>The two look at each other and shrug. \"We don\'t.\"</p><p>Huh...? Now I\'m confused.</p><p>\"Victor, you\'re 21 years old, you\'re an adult and your mom and I have confidence in you. We always think you\'ve got your head in the right place, you were never like other teenagers and you never gave us any problems, so we trust your decision.\"</p><p>\"Father...Mom...\" I didn\'t know they thought of me that way; for some reason, this trust made me happier.</p><p>\"And...? Did you do it!?\" the two asked at the same time.</p><p>My smile threatened to break now...</p><p>\"Yes, we did.\" Violet replied with an amused smile.</p><p>Violet!? Looking at her embarrassed face, I understood that she was confusing the act of sucking blood with sex.</p><p>\"....\"</p><p>They both look at me in disbelief, then they flash the biggest smile I\'ve ever seen in my life.</p><p>\"Did you hear that, honey!? They did it!! We have to buy fireworks!! Let\'s go out now!\" My mom suddenly ran upstairs.</p><p>\"Hey, wait for me! I have to buy the biggest fireworks I can, let\'s celebrate!! This is a happy occasion!! Damn, I wish it was Saturday, I could have a barbecue!\" My dad got up and ran after my mom.</p><p>Soon the two come down with clothes and with the car keys in hand. \"We\'ll be back soon, take care! And don\'t do anything your dad and I wouldn\'t.\" my mom said and winked at me.</p><p>It was pretty obvious that she was hinting at me to do something.</p><p>I just looked at it all in disbelief. When my mom and my dad left in the car, I looked at the door for a few seconds and started laughing.</p><p>I really love my family.</p><p>\"Lord Victor\'s family is...\" Kaguya spoke.</p><p>\"Weird?\"</p><p>\"I would say amusing, but the gentleman is the one who said that.\" Kaguya replied.</p><p>This maid...</p><p>\"Somehow, it makes me a little jealous; my mom and dad would never talk to each other like that.\" Violet spoke with a sad little smile, \"They\'ve spent so much time together they can\'t stand to see each other\'s faces\"</p><p>I touch Violet\'s head and start stroking her head. \"We won\'t be like that, right?\" She spoke looking at me, she touched my other hand, and I could feel she was shaking a little.</p><p>\"I don\'t know,\" I answered honestly while stroking Violet\'s hair, then I continued, \"I may not be very experienced, but I can say something, relationships are a two-way street; if we strive to make it right, I believe that it will work.\"</p><p>\"I don\'t think I\'ll ever regret turning you into a vampire, Victor... But there\'s one thing I\'ll always regret\"</p><p>\"What is it?\" I asked curious.</p><p>She squeezes my other hand tighter. \"I should have stopped those two bitches from being close to the ritual.\" she spoke in a poisonous tone that carried a lot of hate.</p><p>Two bitches? Is she talking about those voices? Why didn\'t she want them both close to the ritual?</p><p>I look at Kaguya, and she shakes her head in a gesture that says she won\'t say anything.</p><p>I look at Violet and see her with a murderous expression. I don\'t know what\'s going on, but one thing I\'m sure of, If a woman is insecure, you must show confidence that everything will be fine (advice from my mother).</p><p>\"Don\'t worry Violet\" She looks at me confused, I move closer to her face, and then I kiss her. She is surprised for a moment, but soon she kisses me back.</p><p>But, since we\'re both inexperienced, our teeth bump into each other.</p><p>We both stopped kissing and looked at each other, and soon started to laugh a little.</p><p>\"Don\'t worry about things you can\'t control, it will cause you stress. I recommend you enter the school of stoicism, it will help you a lot.\"</p><p>\"Stoicism? What is it?\" Violet asked.</p><p>\"It\'s a philosophical doctrine that emerged in Greece in the 4th century, some of its teachings are quite useful.\" I said a little joking and a little serious.</p><p>Violet looks at Kaguya, Kaguya nods and then she disappears. For a moment I saw her running towards the door, she probably went to buy a book or something.</p><p>I\'m slowly getting used to Kaguya\'s speed, but I still can\'t follow her with my eyes.</p><p>But two bitches, huh? As I expected, more things happened after I bit Violet. I can think of two things that happened, I bit the other two female voices like I did with Violet (which I think is very unlikely, after all, Violet said the ritual can only be done by one person).</p><p>Or those two voices did something to me (I\'m inclined to believe this one since Violet is quite protective of me, and I don\'t remember what happened in the ritual either).</p><p>Well, it\'s no use thinking about it too much now, I\'ll just keep this in mind until I find out more, I have to sort out more important things now.</p><p>...</p><p>Currently, I am at the university. Before going to the university, I passed my job and resigned from McDonutus; I plan to earn money in a more practical way... I will rob thieves.</p><p>Think about it, if you have the power of a superhuman, what will you work for? Be a good law-abiding citizen? Pff, the politicians themselves are the ones who steal the most, and they are the people who run this town. They just don\'t get caught, because they know how to hide their tracks.</p><p>So if I steal from a thief who stole from someone else, am I not a good person? Of course the money would be mine, and I wouldn\'t pay that money back or anything like that.</p><p>But, before that, I need three things, first: I need a fake SSN, a fake ID, and a fake bank account. (As I don\'t know about this, I will ask Violet or Kaguya, they must know something)</p><p>Second: I need a black mask.</p><p>Third: I need a black uniform as cringe as possible, those clothes that could only exist in anime like Tokyo Vampire or something like that (I need to make a persona, a thief who steals from other thieves).</p><p>Fourth (this is optional): I need some music; Imagine from John LennonVo.</p><p>Why do I need this song? No reason, and the sound of the piano soothes me too. I plan to listen to it while I\'m at college.</p><p>First, I will rob thieves and make easy money, then I will put this money in a bank in a tax haven. By doing this several times, I can solve my money problems.</p><p>I could make it easier, I could just charm all the corrupt politicians and thieves etc. But I will avoid doing that for now, after all, I believe The Inquisition has something that can track vampires.</p><p>That\'s not too hard to deduce assuming they hunt vampires. Honestly? This organization would be flawed from the start if they had no means of tracking down vampires.</p><p>For now, I just need money; when I get money, I will think about what to do next.</p><p>I\'m at college alone, Violet is at my house, she said something about renovation or something. Before she left, I had to unfortunately... I almost cry blood when I think about it again.</p><p>Cough!</p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, I had to delete my \'hardest game ever\' folder, more than 2 terabytes of videos were deleted, I cried blood when I hit the \'delete\' key on my computer, but it\'s all for the greater good.</p><p>Yes, it\'s all for the greater good. I keep repeating that sentence in my head like it\'s a mantra.</p><p>I can\'t have Violet finding out about that folder, goodbye bachelor life, goodbye my porn...</p><p>As I walked around the university, I noticed that people were looking at me differently. Before ... they just looked at me and ignored me, but now, they\'re looking at me with a shocked face, and sometimes they let out a sigh of disbelief.</p><p>\"Hey, do you know him?\" A woman spoke in a low voice to her friend.</p><p>\"Hmm, he looks familiar, but at the same time he doesn\'t look familiar.\" The friend replied.</p><p>\"He looks hot…\" I heard it from somewhere</p><p>\"I still think the captain of the basketball team is better.\" A woman says</p><p>Well, I\'ve changed a lot...</p><p>Anyway, I walk towards my classroom but suddenly stop when I hear the sound of a basketball.</p><p>Is our team playing today? I was curious; I am thinking about what to do now but, as I had decided that I just wanted to have fun at college, I decided to go to the basketball court. I was always interested in playing basketball, before I couldn\'t because of my disease, but now?</p><p>I clench my fist and the sound of bursting air is heard all around.</p><p>\"Huh? What is that?\" Several people started to question.</p><p>\"Did it look like something broke?\" a man said,</p><p>\"Let\'s check the lab.\" another man spoke.</p><p>While ignoring the little chaos I caused, I wore a predatory smile, now I can play basketball!</p><p>I walk to the basketball court and, upon arriving at the basketball court, I see the university team playing a friendly match with the reserve players from the same university, they must be training.</p><p>I pull my black sunglasses out of my pocket and put them on my face and, as soon as I activate my vision, my world turns red. I don\'t know why I do it, but it\'s kind of become a habit when I smell some weird smell, and when I walked into this court I could smell something. I don\'t know why my sense of smell is more developed than normal vampires, but Violet just said I was special, specifically speaking, my blood was special.</p><p>The RH null blood… Who would have thought that the blood that gave me so much trouble would benefit me in the future, life is ironic for sure.</p><p>Suddenly my vision focused on a silhouette that had a red glowing mark on its neck. Yes, it looks like there\'s a vampire inside.</p><p>I undo my red eyesight and take off my glasses and it turns out that the person who is the vampire is the captain of the basketball team... Good, just the person I hate the most.</p>'),(167,8,'Chapter 8 - Grudges from the past',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>Luan Davis, the captain of my high school basketball team, if you asked me which person I hate the most, I would name this man.</p><p>Because of my illness, I was always in an anemic state, but that doesn\'t mean I couldn\'t do physical activities; in the past, when I was 20 years old, I was supervised by a physical educator who was my friend and, with his help, I could do light exercise. I\'ve always had a craving since I was a teenager... I wanted to play sports.</p><p>Do you know what it feels like to want to swim, play basketball, run, exercise, and not be able to? Because of my illness, I couldn\'t exert myself too much because if I tried too hard, I would pass out. In some of the worst cases, if I tried too hard, I would spend a week in bed at the hospital.</p><p>But, despite that, my doctor said I could do light exercise, and for me, that was enough; I just wanted to get a basketball and play a little, even if I was alone.</p><p>But this man... Luan Davis, he wouldn\'t leave me alone. Every time I trained, every time I tried hard at something, he would come towards me and say:</p><p>\"This is pathetic; Why is a loser like you striving for something useless? You should just stay in a hospital bed!\" And, right after that, he hit me and threw me to the ground while saying that I shouldn\'t have been born, that I was just a burden to my mother.</p><p>The classic bullying that you can see in any American movie, he didn\'t hurt me too much, he just pushed me and told me I was useless while also saying that my mother shouldn\'t have given birth to me. But, I still wouldn\'t give up; I wasn\'t doing it for him, I was doing it for me.</p><p>However ... With time, I started to hate him. I accepted him talking about myself, it doesn\'t affect me so much, but my mother!? That is unforgivable. I knew that what I was doing was useless and that my condition didn\'t allow me to exercise, but he was the person who kept reminding me of how useless I was.</p><p>If there\'s one good thing about this situation, it\'s that I never cried or showed any weakness. I can be physically weak, but I refused to cry in front of anyone, I refused to show weakness; there\'s a glaring difference between being bullied and accepting bullying. I never accepted what happened to me, but unfortunately, I couldn\'t do anything.</p><p>One day I tried to report this to the director, but the director just ignored it, so I did what any sane person would do; I gave up practicing and waited for an opportunity to get revenge. Unfortunately, that opportunity never came; someone was supporting Luan Davis and I didn\'t know who it was, I didn\'t want to tell my parents either.</p><p>After all, that was my problem, it was about my pride, I had to solve it myself. Looking at Luan, I can see the vampire mark with my vision that I call \'vampiric vision\'.</p><p>When I saw that brand, I understood everything; he had support, precisely speaking the support was from the master of this man. A noble vampire...</p><p>Why did I deduct this? Luan was just a boy who suffered from a disease that made his muscles weak, but, for some reason, everyone forgot about it, and he got better all of a sudden. I had forgotten about it too...</p><p>Wrong, it would be wiser to say that Luan\'s support was none other than a Vampire, and I, as an ordinary human, couldn\'t do anything against that force, but now?</p><p>Now things were different.</p><p>I see the basketball bouncing and stopping in front of me.</p><p>\"Hey, you! Throw the ball over here!\" Someone yelled at me.</p><p>I look at the ball and a smile appears on my face, I catch the ball in my hand and I start to bounce the ball on the ground as I walk slowly towards the court.</p><p>When I get close to the court, I position myself for a toss and I throw the ball like an experienced basketball player, the ball travels across the court and lands directly in the basket.</p><p>Everyone who saw this display of precision looked at me with disbelieving looks. What I did was impossible for the average human, but it\'s not totally impossible. NBA players can do it with a lot of practice, but I just used my vision combined with my vampire senses and for me, that was pretty easy. To be honest, I didn\'t need to position myself to throw the basketball, but if I didn\'t it would be pretty weird, right?</p><p>\"Victor...?\" I heard a voice in disbelief.</p><p>I look at the man, he is 190 cm tall with light brown hair and brown eyes, he had a delinquent rebel look boasting a muscular body and a sharp look.</p><p>\"Hey, Luan... Did you miss me?\"</p><p>\"Is that Victor? The skinny one? What happened to him!?\" A player standing next to Luan asked out loud.</p><p>I flashed a smile that for a moment showed my sharp fangs, those with low senses couldn\'t see it but, Luan, I\'m sure he did.</p><p>I walk calmly towards Luan. \"379 days…\" I spoke with an irritated growl, \"It\'s been 379 days since the moment you decided I was a good punching bag.\"</p><p>As I walked towards Luan, the players on the court started to get out of my way, they felt an invisible pressure forcing them to move, it was like if they didn\'t get out of the way something really bad would happen to them: \"I\'m a very mean person, you know? I can\'t let grudges be washed away by the river of time.\"</p><p>As my father always said, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, punch for punch. And, now it would be something like blood for blood.</p><p>I stopped in front of Luan and looked up slightly, he was a little taller than me, and, as always, he had that cocky look on his face like he was superior to everyone, I don\'t like that.</p><p>\"Heh, what do you intend to do? You\'re just a humble —\" Luan tried to say something.</p><p>I gently place a hand on Luan\'s shoulder, and with a forceful gesture, I bring him to his knees.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The ground around him broke like a spider\'s web.</p><p>Ahh~! Yes, that\'s the vision I wanted, that look of disbelief, that look of someone who thought he was on top only to be taken off his imaginary throne, but that\'s not enough.</p><p>My smile starts to grow, I lower my head and approach Luan. Slowly, my smile starts to grow erratically. Slowly, my teeth, like shark fangs, start to show. And, slowly, with a ragged smile that almost borders on insanity, I say,</p><p>\"You had fun, right? Treating me like crap. Hitting me, saying I was useless. Badmouthing my mom. It was fun, right? I bet it was, after all, you always had a smile while doing it, right? It was like you were playing with an insect that could break at any moment, right?\"</p><p>I put some strength in my hand and I felt his shoulder break, \"But I ask you, now what?\"</p><p>I must give Luan credit, he didn\'t show any expression when he felt his shoulder being broken.</p><p>Looking at my fangs and my bloodshot eyes, he understood that I was just like him and soon an angry growl came out of him, \"You\'re just a newborn!\"</p><p>He tried to get up but he just stayed where he was; he didn\'t expect me to have that much strength.</p><p>\"Who gave you permission to get up?\"</p><p>He looked at me with a shocked face that made my smile grow wider and wider.</p><p>\"Luan, is everything okay there?\" someone asked.</p><p>\"Y-Yes, we\'re just talking\"</p><p>Hearing the students\' murmurs, I click my tongue, annoyed, and release Luan. My expression is back to normal, my teeth back to normal, and my eyes back to their bright blue.</p><p>Now that I am calmer, I thought: This place has a lot of people.</p><p>I walk over to the basketball and pick it up.</p><p>\"Let\'s settle this the old-fashioned way, after all, we\'re not barbarians, right?\" I commented with a small smile, I notice his shoulder has already healed, as expected from vampire regeneration.</p><p>I threw the ball to Luan, when Luan caught it the force of the ball made him slide away from where he was; it just demonstrated once again how much stronger I was, even for a vampire who has been transformed for more than 1 year like Luan. I think my blood has given me some unexpected benefits, huh.</p><p>\"1 on 1,\" I said while holding up my finger, \"Whoever scores 7 points wins, each ball in the basket is worth 1 point. In case of a tie, we continue to play until a player has 2 points more than the opponent\"</p><p>\"Simple, right?\" I spoke with a small innocent smile.</p><p>\"Huh? Why are you coming in here and treating it like the court is yours?\" A player spoke.</p><p>I just looked at the player with a disinterested look, he was 160CM and looked like a very active teenager.</p><p>The player started to boil with anger when he saw my gaze, when he was going to start screaming again, Luan said:</p><p>\"Okay, let\'s play.\" Luan gets up and that arrogance that I had eliminated in the previous conflict comes back stronger.</p><p>Heh, yes! That\'s how it\'s supposed to be! He has to act! It can\'t break that easily! I won\'t be satisfied otherwise!</p><p>...</p><p>It was decided that the judge would be a player who was too small to play on the basketball team. The two opponents used the entire court, on one side was Victor, a former aspiring basketball player, and on the other side was Luan, the captain of the basketball team.</p><p>\"What is happening?\" asked a red-haired woman.</p><p>Hearing the woman\'s question, a man quickly turned around and replied, \"Apparently, the captain of the basketball team is going 1-on-1 with an aspiring basketball player.\"</p><p>\"They seem to have a history together.\" Said another woman who was nearby.</p><p>\"What do you mean? What happened?\" Asked the redheaded woman.</p><p>\"When that man arrived\" The woman pointed at Victor. \"He immediately got into conflict with the captain of the basketball team, it looks like the captain of the basketball team was bullying, or something, that man with the blue eyes\"</p><p>\"Oh?\" The red-haired woman looks at the captain of the basketball team with a dangerous look; Isn\'t he that idiot\'s servant? The red-haired woman thought.</p><p>\"But what are you doing here, Ruby? Shouldn\'t you be in med school on the other side of the building?\" Answers the woman while looking at Ruby.</p><p>Ruby is a redheaded woman, she has long red hair that reaches her waist, green eyes, and pale skin like she\'s running out of blood. She\'s wearing a red sweatshirt with black jeans and athletic sneakers. She is a little shorter than the girl who was talking to her, around 175 CM tall. Ruby has a curvy body that can\'t be hidden by the baggy clothes she was wearing, and what\'s most impressive about Ruby\'s appearance is her breasts, which appear to be too big. This is also one of the reasons why she wears baggy clothes, she doesn\'t like people looking at her breasts.</p><p>\"Oh, I heard a commotion and I came here to see what was going on,\" Ruby said as she went up the bleachers, she looked at Victor for a long time until she unconsciously grabbed her neck.</p><p>\"Who do you think will win?\" The woman next to Ruby asked.</p><p>Ruby lets go of her neck and sits down calmly. \"I don\'t know.\" She spoke honestly</p><p>They won\'t use their powers here, right? Ruby suddenly looks at a spot and sees that spot is broken into a cobweb shape.</p><p>She felt her eyes twitch when she saw that little wreckage, which was obviously done by the two newborns on the basketball court.</p><p>\"Miss Ruby, it\'s a surprise to see you here.\" Suddenly a blond man with green eyes appeared.</p><p>Coincidence? Of course, it wasn\'t a coincidence, she thought disdainfully, but nothing showed on her expressionless face.</p><p>Ruby looked at the blond man, he looked like a typical middle-aged nobleman, tall, with blond hair and green eyes.</p><p>Ruby points to the place that was destroyed, the man follows Ruby\'s finger and watches it for a moment: \"I\'ll take care of it.\" he said in an annoyed tone.</p><p>Who was the fool who caused this? Tsk, it was probably my idiot of a dog. The blond-haired man thought with annoyance.</p><p>The man looks at Victor and Luan who have started to approach each other from the court.</p><p>The man sits down next to Ruby. \"Whose newborn is this?\" He spoke while looking at Victor with a haughty look, but he had a feeling he\'d already seen Victor somewhere.</p><p>Ruby snorts in disdain when she sees the man\'s gaze, but she doesn\'t let it show on her face, she just responds in a neutral tone: \"He is the husband of the princess of the Snow Clan.\"</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Ruby looked at the spot and saw that the man had broken the bleachers a bit, she just looked at the man with a \'are you serious\' look? She had just suggested not to attract attention and he did.</p><p>I guess the apple doesn\'t fall far from the rotten tree, huh? Ruby thought as she associated the destruction on the court with the blonde man\'s subordinate.</p><p>\"Hahahaha, you have got to be kidding, right? A plebeian with the princess of Clan Snow? Has hell frozen over and I didn\'t know about it? Hahahaha\"</p><p>Ruby was tempted to further tease this man by saying that the Snow Clan princess wasn\'t the only one, but she was silent: \"Corneliu, I hope you punish your subordinate after this event, you know we don\'t like attention.\"</p><p>\"Yes, of course... He will definitely be punished.\" the now-known man Corneliu spoke up.</p><p>Ruby looked at Corneliu and saw that the expression was distorted with hatred.</p><p>Heh, did just learning that Violet has a husband cause him to go crazy like that? Men and their inflated egos, ridiculous. Ruby thought in disdain.</p><p>As soon as the whistle blows, Ruby loses interest in Corneliu and looks at the court with neutral eyes.</p>'),(168,8,'Chapter 9 - The only one who forgives is God I dont',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>The match was about to start, on one side was a pale man with bright blue eyes and dark black hair, he was wearing a red and white uniform with the number 69, it was a standard basketball player\'s uniform. While this man warmed up, women couldn\'t help but stare at the defined muscles of that man with a little lust in their eyes.</p><p>Catching the girls\' eyes, Victor looked around and thought, \'When did this become a show? Well, let\'s have fun\', Victor displayed a toothy grin but, unlike before, those teeth weren\'t changing into shark-like teeth, it was just a normal smile that showed all of his white teeth.</p><p>\"Hmm?\" Suddenly Victor looks towards the bleachers, he could feel something in the bleachers calling to him, but he couldn\'t identify what it was.</p><p>\"What are you doing, Lady Ruby?\" Corneliu asked Ruby, confused when he saw her suddenly duck.</p><p>\"I am just picking up something that fell,\" Ruby replied neutrally, as she wondered; Why did I hide!? Why did I hide!? You fool!</p><p>Losing interest, Victor focused on his opponent.</p><p>A tall man with brown hair and brown eyes, he looked like a delinquent. He was the man who made Victor\'s life hell for a year, the two men had unresolved issues and Victor wasn\'t planning on leaving the waters of times to wash away his grudge. He\'s not such a saint that he could forgive this man easily, he\'s a vindictive man.</p><p>As the saying goes: An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, blood for blood.</p><p>Luan just looked at Victor with a cocky smile, but he couldn\'t help but think about the things he did to Victor; seeing how it came back to bite his ass in the future, he was wondering if the attitude he had in the past was right. \'I think I should have killed him when I had the chance, after all, at the time his blood smelled really good\', he thought contemptuously.</p><p>But despite thinking about it, he knew he couldn\'t kill someone, he wasn\'t prepared to take this step forward; for Luan, his master\'s blood is enough.</p><p>When the judge throws the ball up Luan, who was close to Victor, whispered in a low voice: \"Don\'t use your gifts.\"</p><p>Victor snorted disdainfully and said in a low voice: \"Tell that to yourself.\"</p><p>The two jumped at the same time then hit the ball simultaneously, an intense exchange took place for a few seconds in the air, but soon the winner was decided, Victor throws the ball to the ground and it bounces in his favor.</p><p>When he fell to the ground the noise was very loud, it was like a very heavy man fell on the court, but strangely, the ground did not break. The moment Victor falls to the ground, he runs at human speed towards the basketball, and as he catches the basketball in his hands, he turns and sees that Luan is already beside him.</p><p>Victor smiles and starts dribbling the ball, he makes some gestures with his hands to try to trick the opponent, but Luan is an experienced captain, he wouldn\'t fall into that trap, and Victor knew that.</p><p>Suddenly Victor brings the ball to Luan\'s face and drops the ball to the ground.</p><p>In making this sudden action, Luan\'s attention was completely focused on the ball slowly falling to the ground but, before the ball could land on the ground, a pale hand suddenly appeared and caught the ball.</p><p>\"My God, did he fake out the team captain? Wow, I can\'t believe he fell for such a simple trick.\" Someone from the stands spoke up.</p><p>When Luan hears this, he grits his teeth in frustration and turns to chase after Victor.</p><p>Victor runs while dribbling the ball to the middle of the court and when he entered the circle of the court, he suddenly jumped!</p><p>Everyone just stared in shock as they watched a human jump from the middle of the court and slowly reach the basketball hoop and bury the ball!</p><p>\"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!!\" The crowd roared excitedly.</p><p>\"That was a slam dunk! I can\'t believe I\'m seeing a 21-year-old boy dunking!!\"</p><p>\"Damn, that was amazing!\"</p><p>\"How is that possible!?\"</p><p>\"Is this humanly possible!?\"</p><p>\"Hey, hey, what\'s his name?\"</p><p>Victor, who was hanging from the rim of the basketball hoop, slowly broke free and fell to the ground. When he fell to the ground and turned around, he looked at Luan and saw that the man\'s expression was distorted with hate, it was too ugly to look at, but that expression filled Victor with satisfaction, slowly a predatory smile began to form on his face.</p><p>...</p><p>\"Humpf, this newborn thinks highly of himself, any vampire can do what he did.\"</p><p>Ruby just looked at the blond man like she was watching a rare creature, he totally forgot he was in a crowd of people, huh?</p><p>Ruby looks at the girl who was next to her and, for a moment, her eyes turn blood red. \"Ignore everything that man says, okay?\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" The woman replied in a robotic tone.</p><p>Ruby nods contentedly, her eyes soon turn green then she looks at Corneliu and says, \"He\'s not using his gifts.\"</p><p>\"Huh?\" Corneliu looks at Ruby.</p><p>\"If he was using his gifts, the basketball court, the basketball hoop, and everything else would be destroyed; he\'s just using the ability of a trained human. It\'s quite impressive that he can control his strength so well, and I think he doesn\'t even realize what he\'s doing,\" Ruby compliments him.</p><p>But Corneliu just snorted in disdain: \"All newborn vampires can do that, he\'s no big deal.\" He spoke in a normal voice.</p><p>\"Oh? Can you tell me which newborn vampires can do this? I\'m curious.\" Ruby\'s green eyes sparkled a little in curiosity.</p><p>\"...\" Corneliu was silent and ignored Ruby.</p><p>Idiot, that\'s why female vampires hate you, your ego is the size of the world but it\'s also very fragile, you look like a child. Ruby thought with disdain</p><p>...</p><p>\"What about the agreement not to use your gifts?\" Luan asked in a hateful voice.</p><p>\"I\'m not using my gifts, I don\'t need to do something like that to defeat you,\" Victor spoke in disdain while maintaining an arrogant smile.</p><p>Luan\'s face twists into hate: \"We\'ll see if you don\'t need to use your powers,\" he said in a hateful tone, he seems to have totally forgotten what he said a few seconds ago.</p><p>Again, both opponents were in the middle of the court.</p><p>The referee throws the ball up and blows the whistle.</p><p>The two opponents jump towards the ball, and again they fight in midair for a few seconds, but this time Victor loses.</p><p>Luan falls to the ground and catches the ball, he turns around and is about to run towards Victor\'s basket, but is stopped by Victor standing in front of him.</p><p>Luan starts dribbling the ball, and Victor tries to steal it, but Luan defends.</p><p>\"It looks like the team captain has the advantage now.\"</p><p>\"Of course, he wouldn\'t lose to a beginner!\" One of the captain\'s most fanatical fans spoke.</p><p>Luan and Victor start running on the court, one was trying to make a basket and the other was trying to steal the ball.</p><p>Getting irritated by the impasse, Luan tries to push Victor using his vampire strength, but Victor doesn\'t move.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>\"Ohhh!? What was that loud noise!? Are they ok!? I think I heard a bone-breaking,\" someone near the court yelled.</p><p>\"You\'re right, I heard a cracking sound like something had broken.\" A man standing next to him spoke.</p><p>The audience was right, a bone broke, and it wasn\'t Victor\'s.</p><p>\"heh? Why are you wearing that pained expression? Will you cry?\"</p><p>\"Just what are you made of?\" Luan asked in shock as he felt his ribs healing; he tried to take down Victor, but it felt like he was trying to bring down a mountain.</p><p>Victor patted his chest and said, \"I\'m just built different.\"</p><p>Luan huffed, he suddenly pulled away from Victor.</p><p>\"Is he trying to do a long shot? Is he crazy!? He\'s not even in the middle of the court yet!\"</p><p>\"Even if he\'s the captain, that is impossible for him to do, right?\"</p><p>\"He\'s crazy! He really threw the ball!!\"</p><p>\"Fool,\" Luan said.</p><p>Victor looked at the ball in the air and started running towards the basket he was protecting, arriving at the basket, he just waits patiently for the ball to come down, if the ball enters the basket, bad luck for him, but if Luan misses, he is prepared for a counterattack.</p><p>The entire crowd just watches anxiously as they wait for the ball to drop.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>\"The ball hit the hoop! He missed!\" Someone from the crowd shouted.</p><p>\"Heh, looks like the goddess of luck is not favoring you today,\" Victor takes the ball and looks at Luan who was running towards him, as he looked at Luan he thinks, \'The goddess of luck is a bitch, one time she pays attention to you but, eventually, she loses interest and looks at someone else, so I don\'t need her.\'</p><p>Victor positions himself to throw the ball.</p><p>\"Don\'t tell me!? Will he try to throw the ball from the end of the court!? He\'s crazy, that\'s impossible! He\'s definitely not going to make that!\"</p><p>Realizing what Victor is going to do, Luan increases his running speed, with only seconds left before he gets in front of Victor.</p><p>\"Too slow,\" Victor said.</p><p>Suddenly, Victor changes position and holds the ball with one hand then he throws the ball; as soon as he threw the ball, Victor started running at high speed.</p><p>\"Huh!? What is he planning!?\"</p><p>Baaam!</p><p>A thunderous noise was heard on the court, everyone looked stunned and saw that the ball hit the panel above the basketball hoop and bounced.</p><p>\"Do not tell me! Was that his plan!?\"</p><p>\"HAHAHAHA!!\" Victor chuckled with a manic smile on his face that showed all of his teeth.</p><p>Suddenly, Victor jumps up then catches the ball in the air and buries it in the basket!</p><p>\"OHHHHHHHHHHHH!!\"</p><p>\"This man is insane!\"</p><p>\"Is he really human!? How did he run from the end of a court and still manage to catch the ball in midair!?\"</p><p>\"Fool! He planned it, and you didn\'t see he ran before he threw the ball! If we calculate right, this feat is possible to do, it\'s just extremely difficult!\" A man with black glasses spoke as he lifted his glasses, for some reason, the people standing nearby could see the man\'s glasses glowing.</p><p>Victor lets go of the basket\'s hoop and falls to the ground, then he looks at Luan with the same smile that shows all of his teeth: \"Is this all you can do?\" He teased him again.</p><p>Luan\'s expression starts to distort again, his expression was something to behold, he was extremely angry. \'Who does this newborn think he is!? He comes to my territory and challenges me!? Who does he think he is!? He\'s just trash! I do not accept this!\'</p><p>Seeing Luan\'s expression constantly changing, Victor just smiled then smiled even more; he looked like a child who found a fun toy to break.</p><p>\"... Oh, right,\" Luan spoke in a smug tone as if he realized something. \"I think I shouldn\'t hold back anymore.\"</p><p>Victor stops smiling and looks at Luan, noticing that his atmosphere has changed, he says in disdain: \"Heh, and what happened to the agreement not to use powers?\"</p><p>\"You\'ve been using your powers from the start, don\'t expect me to follow that rule.\"</p><p>\"Tsk, Tsk, it looks like your brain is smaller than a dog; actually saying you have a dog\'s brain is very offensive for the dog itself. After all, at least dogs are loyal,\" Victor said while pointing to a local.</p><p>Luan followed Victor\'s finger, and the moment Luan saw a man with blond hair and green eyes standing in the stands, he froze:</p><p>Corneliu made a gesture with his mouth, and Luan seemed to understand what Corneliu had said.</p><p>\"Looks like the dog found its owner.\" Victor flashed a sneer.</p><p>\"And? What will you do?\" Victor asked as he smiled again.</p><p>\"Are you going to obey your owner or are you going to continue? Decide! How good a dog are you, make up your own mind! Choose!\" His smile grew with every word he spoke, he wanted Luan to continue, he wanted Luan to show that he wasn\'t a dog and challenge him.</p><p>Seeing the gestures his master was making, Luan bites his lip and says, \"I give up,\" he spoke out loud, his voice seemed to be heard across the court, and everyone was looking at the basketball team captain in shock.</p><p>Suddenly Victor\'s smile died, and he lost interest, \"Is that it? In the end, you\'re just a dog.\"</p><p>\"Referee, you heard him, right. The captain dropped out, the show is over,\" Victor said as he took off his shirt and threw it somewhere.</p><p>Victor didn\'t wait for the referee to say something, he had lost interest, and he also fulfilled two of his goals. He humiliated Luan in front of the whole school he fought so hard to be accepted in and found out who was behind him; for now, that\'s enough.</p><p>When the women saw Victor\'s body, they started talking to each other.</p><p>\"My God, look at his body.\"</p><p>\"He is so hot.\"</p><p>\"Does he have a girlfriend?\"</p><p>\"Actually, who is he?\" A woman asked confused.</p><p>Victor flashed a sneer, he looked at the women in the stands and thought; I\'m married, witches. He didn\'t even set eyes on these women.</p><p>Ruby, who hid again when she noticed that Victor turned to the bleachers, got up and looked at Victor who was leaving; why do I keep hiding? Not even she knew why she was acting like this, she was just too embarrassed...</p><p>Ruby then looks at Corneliu, and sees the kind of face he was making; Yes, he will definitely attack Victor, I have to tell Violet... Actually, I think I should just tell him myself, but... I\'m embarrassed! I can\'t go out there and say, hey, Victor. I\'m your wife, good morning... Just thinking about it makes me feel ashamed! Yes, I will definitely contact Violet... Maybe I will contact him myself? Ahhhhhh!! My head!!!</p><p>Even though Ruby was going through a mental breakdown, her face didn\'t change, she still had an expressionless face as she watched Victor walk off the court.</p>'),(169,8,'Chapter 10 - A frog in a well',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>After the conflict I had with Luan, I lost interest in continuing college that day. I wasn\'t satisfied with just doing that to Luan, this 1-year grudge can\'t be washed away with just that, but I knew I would have my chance soon, and I could deduce it from the hateful face that noble vampire was making.</p><p>He wasn\'t even trying to hide his hatred for me, and honestly, I didn\'t understand why he hated me so much. After all, I only hit his dog, right? Noble vampires seem to be beings with egos the size of the world, I doubt he would be enraged by just that, right?</p><p>Before returning home I purposely waited for the noble vampire in an open dark place, I know vampires can\'t walk in sunlight but if he was in college at that time then he must have ways to walk while the sun is shining in the sky, right? He might have some car that doesn\'t let sunlight in, or he might wear those clothes that cover his entire body.</p><p>I waited for a few minutes, but when I realized he wasn\'t going to come, I lost interest. Before leaving the place where I was standing, I used my vampire vision to look around, and I didn\'t see any vampire souls, I only saw humans for several KM.</p><p>Realizing that everything was fine, I returned home.</p><p>…</p><p>\"You fool! What were you thinking showing off in the middle of the entire university!?\" Corneliu Funar yelled angrily as he hit the desk in the office he was at. Because of his supernatural strength, the desk he hit had his handprint carved into the wood; a few seconds before hitting the table, he managed to regain enough control to not destroy his table again.</p><p>Corneliu was acting as a coach at this college, despite being a coach, he didn\'t teach the students anything, he was only in charge of managing the basketball team, but that was just on paper.</p><p>The reality was he wasn\'t doing anything, he was abusing his vampiric charm to stay in this school in an attempt to win the heart of Ruby, one of the four flowers of the vampire world.</p><p>Luan at this point was very scared; he might act like a king in college, but he knows that in front of the vampire who gave him his gifts, he was nothing more than a slave.</p><p>Luan knows that noble vampires are arrogant beings, they think the world revolves around them and they have a planet-sized egos, but that ego is as fragile as glass.</p><p>At least, that\'s what Luan thinks of noble vampires. After all, he\'s only been in contact with a single noble vampire since he became a newborn.</p><p>Luan looks at his master, Corneliu Funar, heir house Funar, a spoiled vampire who thinks he\'s the center of the world. Luan still remembers the day he was in a hospital bed and a young man who looked like a fairytale prince showed up to help him, he felt he was chosen to be that prince\'s knight, but the reality was much more difficult than he imagined.</p><p>This prince was nothing more than a spoiled vampire, but as he helped him out of that deplorable condition, he still feels gratitude to his master.</p><p>\"You have nothing to say!?\" Corneliu yelled angrily.</p><p>Luan remained silent, he knows that no matter what he says, he will suffer the punishment anyway. After suffering from it for a year, he\'s already used to it; torture is something very light when you get used to it. \'As long as my master is not touching my family, for me, a little torture is nothing\'.</p><p>\"Tsk\" Corneliu ignores Luan and starts biting his fingers as he starts to think, this was a habit he had had since he was a child.</p><p>A few minutes later, Corneliu thought of something, he looked at Luan: \"I\'ll save your punishment for later, but first, we must kill that newborn.\"</p><p>Corneliu changed his aim, he thought that if he killed Victor he would be free to court Violet. Now that he knew Violet was in this town, he thought of it as an opportunity.</p><p>Luan opens his eyes wide: \"W-Why? Why should we kill him?\" He stuttered. Despite being a vampire for over a year, Luan still hadn\'t killed a soul, he always drank his master\'s blood after all.</p><p>\"Are you questioning me? If I say do something, you do it. Don\'t forget your position here.\" Corneliu spoke with a distorted face.</p><p>\"Y-Yes, Master…\" Luan stammered.</p><p>Corneliu nodded in satisfaction, he sits down in the chair and starts to get annoyed when he thinks a newborn has stolen one of the flowers of the vampire world.</p><p>Violet had always been an object of desire for all young noble vampires, a beautiful vampire with one of the rarest bloodlines in the vampire world. He couldn\'t accept that a humble newborn had decided to steal his most prized possession.</p><p>\"Just wait, you little slave, I\'m going to make you dog food,\" Corneliu spoke in a vicious tone.</p><p>...</p><p>February 3rd.</p><p>I\'ll be honest, I didn\'t expect Violet to make a huge basement in my house. I mean I live in a normal American house, and I also have a small basement, but what I\'m seeing right now is just bullshit!</p><p>My old normal basement that you can see in many American houses now looks like a cave that has lots of tunnels and rooms, what did she transform this basement into? This looks like an underground base that came out of some movie, don\'t tell me she installed an artificial intelligence named Blue Queen too?</p><p>A better question, how did she do it so fast!?</p><p>\"Hmm, is it okay to make a basement this size here at home?\"</p><p>\"Yes, why not?\" Violet asked me, curious. She was wearing casual clothes this time, a simple white sweatshirt and black denim shorts, she was also wearing purple sports shoes with the symbol of a famous sports brand.</p><p>I was a little surprised by the outfits she picked out, I thought she only had black-colored outfits or something, or cosplay-like outfits. Well, she looks beautiful in those clothes, and I\'m not complaining.</p><p>Seeing me watching her, she displays a small satisfied smile.</p><p>\"I mean, isn\'t my house going to fall down or something with a hole this size?\" I\'m not very knowledgeable in physics, but I think if I create a hole this big under the house, won\'t the house fall down? I think that is how it works?</p><p>\"Oh, don\'t worry about it.\" Violet claps her hands lightly, and soon I feel someone approaching; I use my vampire vision and see that person is a human.</p><p>The characteristics of a vampire are very easy to identify, but I always use my vampiric vision to make sure. After all, some humans look like vampires when they are afflicted by some kind of illness, like the one I had.</p><p>This woman was human, but she looked a little different from the normal humans I\'ve seen... I could see her heart glowing as if inviting me to feed on her, but the blue aura that surrounded the woman and the heart that she seemed to glow brighter than an ordinary human I saw told me she wasn\'t a normal human.</p><p>A woman with western features appeared, she had short black hair and golden eyes, she was wearing a casual outfit consisting of a white shirt with a beach photo stamped on her chest, simple denim shorts, and a basic pair of sandals. She looked a little short, I think it was 155CM? Or 160CM?</p><p>She looked a little shorter than Kaguya.</p><p>\"Darling, meet June, and June meet my husband, Victor,\" Violet said as she hugged my arms possessively.</p><p>\"Yo,\" She said while making a \'V\' gesture with her fingers, then she said:</p><p>\"Can you stop looking at me with those red eyes? I\'m feeling a little threatened...\" She spoke with a happy smile on her face. By her excited tone of voice, and expression that looked like she was having fun, I honestly didn\'t believe she felt threatened at all.</p><p>I close my eyes for a moment, and soon my vision returns to normal, I look at her with my sapphire blue eyes, and say, \"Sorry about that, it\'s a bad habit of mine\" I said.</p><p>\"Don\'t worry, don\'t worry\" She said while smiling.</p><p>\"Lady Violet, I did my job and I want my payment, you can deposit it in my account with the same amount as always\"</p><p>\"I know, a million dollars, right?\" Violet spoke casually.</p><p>I almost choked when I heard the amount of money, just how much money does my wife have to go throwing around a million dollars like it\'s a dollar bill?</p><p>\"Yes, Yes, Indeed,\" June spoke while shaking her head, she makes a few gestures with her hands, and soon the basement began to change, white ceramics began to grow on the floor, and several wooden coffins began to be created in the bedrooms. The walls began to turn a whiter color and I could see that bricks began to be created, and like a magic trick; The basement that once looked like a cave now looks like the interior of a mansion that has been painted in a black and white theme.</p><p>With my current knowledge, only one group of beings could do what this woman did: \"Witches\"</p><p>June displays a small satisfied smile, but soon that smile changes to a happy, joyful smile.</p><p>\"Indeed. June is a witch I hired when I arrived in the US, as you can see, she has more useful and ... unique skills.\" Violet spoke with an elegant smile.</p><p>\"If you have an order that cannot be legally placed, you can ask June, she will charge dearly but, since you are my husband, she will give a discount, right?\" Violet spoke with an elegant smile as she looked at June who had her smile twitching slightly.</p><p>\"Of course, Lady Violet,\" June said.</p><p>I looked at Violet, and I could deduce a little bit of what she was thinking, this princess was thinking how helpful it is to have a person who can literally create a structure with a hand gesture. I think she plans to keep June around, for a small moment, I almost felt sorry for June, but it was only for a moment, after all, I barely know June enough to feel any sympathy for her.</p><p>And, Violet seems to have a long history with this witch.</p><p>\"Why did you create this basement-\" I was going to ask Violet why she created this underground basement, but when I remember all the servants she had, I fell silent. \"Nevermind\"</p><p>Violet pouted, I think she wanted to explain to me in detail why she created this basement, I smile a little and start stroking her head.</p><p>For a moment, I feel Violet\'s body tremble like she\'s been shocked by electricity or something.</p><p>As I stroked Violet\'s head, I looked at the newly constructed basement; Of course, this is all very useful since, if Violet\'s underlings live here, they will be quite helpful in the future, but how the fuck am I going to explain this to my parents?</p><p>I\'ve decided I\'ll keep it hidden from them, they can be weird and ignore my physical change, they can be weird enough and accept Violet as my wife easily, but this here? This is another level of bullshit I would have to invent to convince my parents.</p><p>Suddenly remembering the plans I had to earn money while walking through college, I looked at June.</p><p>\"Just call me June,\" She said smiling.</p><p>\"I need a fake ID, a fake bank account, preferably a tax haven bank account, I also need a fake SSN, can you arrange that for me?\"</p><p>June looked at me confused, but soon she responded with a professional smile: \"Oh? That\'s easy\"</p><p>June picks up a phone and punches in some numbers, then she starts talking to someone, a few minutes later she looks at me: \"Which fake name do you want?\"</p><p>\"Hmm. Name James Bon- Cough, James Smith.\" For a moment, I almost named a famous agent from the movies, I thought it would be cool, but when I started stealing in the future, it could get me into some issues. Copyrights. Believe me, copyright issues are very annoying, stealing is much easier than solving copyright issues.</p><p>She nodded, a few minutes passed again, and I could feel Violet\'s breathing start to get more erratic, she was looking at me with glowing red eyes. She looked like she was going to jump on me at any moment.</p><p>For a moment, I looked at my hand; do I have a god hand? Why is she reacting like this just by me stroking her head?</p><p>As I looked at my hand as if it were Midas\' right hand.</p><p>June just spoke on the phone, and soon she summons two documents, the first document is a fake ID card that has my fake SSN on it, and the other is my bank account, I look at the bank account document and I see the document is from a bank account in a tax-free country.</p><p>The wonders of a tax haven!</p><p>\"You are very efficient, are all witches like this?\" I asked genuinely surprised.</p><p>\"This information is going to cost a little more, do you really want to know?\" June spoke as her golden eyes sparkled a little, if this were an anime I\'m sure her eyes would turn into the dollar sign by now.</p><p>\"Forget what I said,\" I reply.</p><p>\"Tsk, too bad,\" She pouted.</p><p>She\'s really greedy, huh? Well, at least she\'s honest.</p><p>Violet suddenly looks at June with her blood red eyes: \"Leave\" She spoke as the teeth began to change into sharp teeth that could tear flesh easily.</p><p>June felt a shiver run down her spine as she looked into Violet\'s eyes. \"Cough, I remembered that I had to feed my cat in Hawaii, take care! Lord Husband, soon I will be back to collect money for my services, seeya!\"</p><p>June makes a few gestures with her hands, and suddenly a magic circle appears on the ground, and she disappears.</p><p>When June leaves, I suddenly feel an explosion of bloodlust coming from Violet.</p><p>I display a small smile and I also let my desire out, I wanted her! I wanted her blood!</p><p>\"Let\'s have fun~ Darling\" Violet spoke with a huge smile that showed all of her teeth.</p>'),(170,8,'Chapter 11 - Obsession And The Perfect Maid',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>Violet suddenly jumps on top of me. I quickly caught her in my arms, she wraps her legs around my waist, and I hold her by her soft ass; I look up a little bit and stare into her blood-red eyes.</p><p>\"Darling~! Darling~! Darling~!\" She looked like she was going crazy, she had a huge smile on her face, the skin on her cheeks was a little red and she was breathing erratically as she hugged me.</p><p>Feeling the bloodlust that is emanating from Violet\'s body, I too start to loosen the shackles that keep me under control, my teeth start to shift and a predatory smile appears on my face.</p><p>Seeing my smile and realizing that I was accepting her advances, Violet\'s smile grows erratically. Slowly her teeth start to change into sharp fangs, but she doesn\'t attack me right away, She starts sniffing me, and breathing erratically as if out of breath, she brings her face close to my neck, starts licking my neck with her tongue and, when my neck is wet enough, she opens her mouth and then bites me!</p><p>\"Ugh~!\" I feel my blood being drained, I also feel an unnatural surge of pleasure enter my body, this feeling was very addictive.</p><p>I push Violet into the wall, I hear the sound of the wall cracking, but I don\'t care, I also open my mouth, and soon I bite her neck too!</p><p>\"Ahh~~!\" She stops sucking my blood and moans sensually as remnants of my blood that she sucked and didn\'t have time to swallow start to fall from her sharp fangs, I feel my shirt being smeared with the blood but I don\'t care.</p><p>I feel something \'wake up\' and it was like a vampire who can\'t see the sunlight opening the lid of his coffin; it also feels like he was rubbing on Violet\'s coffin, wanting to wake her up from her sleep for them to have fun tonight. Wonderful.</p><p>Violet starts licking my neck again as her coffin starts to shake as the vampire wakes up. Unfortunately, I couldn\'t directly feel the real deal, but that\'s a problem that can be solved easily.</p><p>When I was going to rip my clothes off with my right arm, I sensed a horrible stench coming from an area near my house, it was like someone opening the sewer in my street.</p><p>Violet seems to smell it too, and I see all the bloodlust and her excitement has faded and been replaced by annoyance.</p><p>I get annoyed too, that would be an understatement to say how upset I was. My feeling now was like I was about to eat a delicious meal with my wife, but suddenly the sewer in the street broke, and the place we were eating stank with a terrible odor.</p><p>I stop sucking her blood and look up using my vampire vision, I see two silhouettes at a considerable distance from my house, I see two men together.</p><p>They were both human, but just like June, they had an aura covering them as if it was protecting them. But, unlike June whose aura was blue, these individuals\' auras were golden, and I was smelling a horrible stench coming from them.</p><p>Hearing someone\'s teeth grind, I look over at Violet and see that she has a rather startling expression on her face, her face was distorted in anger; she was completely pissed off.</p><p>\"Those fuckers! They just had to come and interrupt my moment with my husband, those mother fuckers! They just can\'t sit in their church and be quiet while they play with the kids they love so much!? Those mangy dogs! Pieces of shit!\"</p><p>I just opened my eyes in surprise as I saw Violet\'s face distort into various expressions of disgust and anger as she spoke words that would make the most experienced sailors proud.</p><p>I bring my face closer to Violet\'s neck and start licking the blood off her neck.</p><p>Upon feeling me lick her neck, she stops insulting the people I assume are from The Inquisition and moans a little. \"Ahh~\".</p><p>I feel her gaze on my neck and she soon starts licking me too, as I licked her I said, \"Calm down, and think clearly, I sincerely doubt these agents are here looking for us.\"</p><p>\"Ahh~~!\" She moans again this time a little louder, and while breathing a little harder, she says, \"The agents of The Inquisition, Ugh~\" She bites her lip a little and wraps her legs tighter around my waist.</p><p>I start to lightly pat her ass while licking her neck and blowing a little in her ears:</p><p>\"Wait~! Ahhhh~!! I can\'t form a coherent train of thought while~\" I feel like liquids have started to leak from her sacred coffin, and wet the shorts she was wearing.</p><p>\"Darling~, Ugh~, Wait!\" She spoke the last word in a strong tone.</p><p>I stop my caresses and look at her face which was a flushed mess, her breathing was erratic, and she was looking at me with desire burning in her eyes: \"...Are you calmer?\" I spoke while trying to ignore my impulses.</p><p>\"...Yes~...\" She replied as she tried to catch her breath.</p><p>She pushes me away from her and claps her hands in a \'let me down\' gesture, I nod my head and let go, then I too step away from her and look at the visitors.</p><p>Cough! Cough!</p><p>She coughed a few times, and soon she had a noble look again; that look would be more convincing if her shorts weren\'t wet and her face wasn\'t a flushed mess.</p><p>\"What was I really talking about?\" She asked out loud with a confused face.</p><p>I can\'t help but laugh a little when I see the face she was making.</p><p>\"What?\" She said looking at me while pouting.</p><p>\"I was thinking how adorable my wife is\"</p><p>Hearing what I said, I could see her pale skin starting to turn a healthy red, she made a \"Humpf\" sound and turned her face away while she had a happy smile.</p><p>She is so adorable my god! How can such a lovely creature exist?</p><p>Before my wife and I fell into our pink world again, I said, \"The Inquisition?\"</p><p>She looks at me confused: \"The Inquisition? What about them?\"</p><p>I just look at her with an expressionless face, don\'t tell me she already forgot? I look up and see they\'re walking like they\'re looking for something, one of them is also holding something in his hands that I don\'t know what it is. At least they\'ve stopped stinking a little bit.</p><p>\"Oh, those bastards, huh?\" She spoke when she sniffed the air and smelled the stench, her face grimaced with disgust, and then she continued:</p><p>\"The Inquisition agents are probably patrolling, they have a device capable of tracking vampires. This device is useless when they are hunting noble vampires, but for hunting common vampires without support, this device is very useful.\"</p><p>\"Why is this device useless for the nobles?\" I asked, curious.</p><p>\"Noble vampires are the only vampires who can pay witches to do countermeasures for this type of technology.\" She spoke, and then she continued: \"Of course there are exceptions, there are ordinary vampires who have been transformed and have a lot of accumulated wealth. After all, this is the united states, the country of capitalism, there are several plebeian vampires with a lot of money here\"</p><p>\"These agents who are patrolling must be recruits since an experienced agent has his own means of investigating the presence of a vampire in the region.\"</p><p>\"Just out of curiosity, how much does this countermeasure cost?\" I asked, curious.</p><p>\"Hmm, depending on the witch you contact, the value could reach 5 billion dollars\"</p><p>I open my eyes in shock: \"...Isn\'t this too inflated!?\"</p><p>\"That\'s what happens when a product is monopolized... Witches are the only ones who have this technology, they can put whatever price they want on it, that\'s why noble vampires always invest in maintaining friendly relations with witches.\" Violet said as she walked to one of the bedrooms, \"I\'m going to change clothes,\" she straightens her hair that was messed up, and then she started to take off the sweatshirt she was wearing and was just in a black bra, after that she started to take off the jean shorts she was wearing and was left with only black panties, I decided to follow her towards the bedroom of course.</p><p>When I go towards the room, Kaguya appears from my shadow and holds my shoulders with her hand.</p><p>\"What are you doing, Kaguya?\" I couldn\'t help but ask in a neutral tone.</p><p>\"Lord Victor, please don\'t be a degenerate now. You have all eternity to feast on each other\'s lusts, you have all the time in the world to practice the act of reproduction. You might even decide to make eleven babies in the future to compete in the world cup, but now is not the time for that\"</p><p>I feel my eyes twitch a little when I hear Kaguya\'s words, can\'t this woman speak in a better way? And why the hell does she think I would make eleven babies just to play in the world cup!? Shouldn\'t vampires be hard to get pregnant or something?</p><p>\"Please join me, Lord Victor,\" Kaguya said as she pointed to the room beside Violet.</p><p>I think for a few seconds about my decision. I know that Kaguya won\'t stop me again from entering Violet\'s room. I also know if I enter Violet\'s room now, and I see my wife as she came into the world, I\'m going to get excited again, and start teasing my wife.</p><p>On the one hand, I want to go into my wife\'s room right now, but this horrible stench that seems like the stench of a sewer lowers my spirits... Tsk, first let\'s solve this little problem, I can\'t be horny now.</p><p>I decide to follow Kaguya\'s suggestion and walk towards the room next to Violet, I enter the room and see that there is a change of new clothes on the bed.</p><p>\"Lord Victor, do you want help changing?\" Kaguya asked while gesturing with her hand, she was looking at me with an expressionless face, but I could see her eyes shining. I swear I saw her doing an expression of \'please accept, I\'m a trustworthy maid\'.</p><p>... I\'ll be honest, I was a little curious how she was going to change my clothes so, like a good adventurer, I said, \"Of course, help me change my clothes.\"</p><p>When I spoke those words, Kaguya\'s eyes changed to blood red, and I could see her eyes light up as if she was excited then she displayed a small satisfied smile. \"As expected from Lord Victor; Lady Violet has chosen a good husband\"</p><p>Before I can understand anything, she ... disappeared into shadows and passed through my body? I noticed that the clothes that were on the bed disappeared and, without me understanding anything that happened, Kaguya was standing in front of me again holding the clothes I was wearing. The clothes I was wearing were even folded! It all happened so fast I could barely understand what happened.</p><p>I look down at my chest and realize I was already dressed. \"…This is impressive…\" I comment surprised. I was talking about her speed, and how she changed my clothes without me feeling her touch on my body…</p><p>She holds her hand to her chest as a gesture of respect and speaks with an expressionless face, but I can tell she was proud, \"I am the strongest and most perfect maid, of course, this would be a natural result.\"</p><p>\"Heh,\" I display a small smile, somehow I find her adorable, I approach her and start stroking her head.</p><p>She lifts her expressionless face a little and looks at me, I could see her eyes light up a little, she looked excited: \"Lord Victor, please keep your hands off the maids. Within just one day, are you already cheating on your wife?\"</p><p>My smile threatens to break when I hear what Kaguya says: \"Is it not the maid\'s duty to serve her master?\" I spoke with a small smile.</p><p>\"So, you are abusing your authority.\" She spoke with the same expressionless face. \"I understand, as it\'s the master\'s order, I can\'t do anything. After all, the master\'s orders are absolute and, as I am a perfect maid and the eldest of my sisters, I must be the one to sacrifice myself so that you don\'t lay your hands on the younger maids.\" She spoke as if she were making a great sacrifice.</p><p>This maid, she\'s read a lot of erotic books... I stop stroking her head and tug at both her plump cheeks.</p><p>\"Lord Victor~, I\'m not a masochist~, I don\'t like pain, please stop~\"</p><p>\"Stop your delusions, maid.\" I let go of her cheek, when she lowered her head and touched her cheeks which I pulled, I stroked her head lightly and said:</p><p>\"Good job Kaguya,\" I said gratefully, I really liked this maid\'s personality. I feel Kaguya tremble a little when I said those words, I think she didn\'t like what I said? I look down, but I just see Kaguya\'s black hair.</p><p>I stopped petting Kaguya and left the room, as I walk towards the stairs that lead to my house, I decided to wait for Violet upstairs. After all, I just heard my parents\' voices, I think they came home.</p><p>When Victor left the room, Violet who was wearing a different outfit appeared in the room Victor was in and looked at Kaguya who had a shocked expression.</p><p>\"Kaguya\" Violet speaks.</p><p>Kaguya awakens from stupor and assumes a blank expression.</p><p>\"Yes, Lady Violet?\"</p><p>Violet\'s eyes changed to blood red and she spoke in an emotionless tone, \"He\'s mine... He\'s only mine!\" She spoke in an obsessive tone.</p><p>\"I know, Lady Violet, I was just surprised, it won\'t happen again.\"</p><p>\"Good\" Violet\'s eyes return to their normal color and she smiles contentedly, Violet turns and starts walking towards the stairs.</p><p>\"Lady Violet\" Kaguya calls out.</p><p>Violet stops walking.</p><p>\"What do you intend to do about Lady Sasha and Lady Ruby?\" Violet heard Kaguya say.</p><p>Violet\'s body starts to shake, she clenches her fists tightly and the air around Violet starts to heat up. If a normal human saw Violet\'s face at this point, they would just run away in fear.</p><p>Her face was distorted in anger, her eyes were glowing with a dangerous glint, and all her sharp teeth were showing. She didn\'t look like a noblewoman, she looked like a monster that was hateful enough to burn the world.</p><p>Realizing that Violet was losing control again, Kaguya takes a small green ball from her pocket and breaks it, then she spoke in a neutral tone, \"June.\"</p><p>\"I know! I know!\" June who was wearing a green bikini appears in a magic circle and, with a snap of her fingers, she insulated the entire basement she created with a sound isolation barrier. She made sure that any sound could not be heard outside the door or on the surface, she also reinforces the walls with her magic power.</p><p>No longer able to take the feeling she was holding, Violet punches the wall: \"Those bitches!\"</p><p>Boooom!</p><p>The wall breaks in the shape of a spider\'s web.</p><p>\"She has an absurd strength as always, and it looks like she\'s stronger?\" June spoke in a calm tone as if this happened often, but she was a little surprised that Violet was getting stronger.</p><p>\"He is just mine! Just mine! I will not allow any woman near him! I will kill those whores!\"</p><p>A bloody pressure began to spread throughout the basement, realizing that Violet was raging uncontrollably and not returning to normal, Kaguya says:</p><p>\"Lady Violet... The two women are your childhood friends...\"</p><p>Hearing Kaguya\'s words, the atmosphere around Violet weakened considerably, but the sense of danger was still present.</p><p>Violet clenches her fists tightly, and bites her lip in frustration; it\'s like she\'s having an internal battle, but soon her obsession with Victor seems to win.</p><p>Violet spoke in a tone devoid of emotions: \"I know…I know…I know…That\'s why I don\'t want Victor to meet them, I don\'t want to have to kill my friends from childhood.\" Soon she began to control her powers and the atmosphere returned to normal as if nothing had happened.</p><p>June makes a gesture with her hands and soon the barrier she put in place disappears: \"As always, the same amount of money in the same bank account. I\'ll charge a little more also for the teleportation tools, these things aren\'t cheap, and please don\'t call me suddenly, I was in Hawaii enjoying the beach, you know? Tsk, Tsk, Seeya.\" She spoke as she threw three more green balls to Kaguya who took them and put them in her pocket.</p><p>From beginning to end, Kaguya just looked at June like she was looking at a piece of trash, but in the end, she nodded her head in agreement with June\'s requests. The witch\'s services were cheaper compared to other witches who she knew, so spending a little money to prevent Violet from screwing it up is a small price to pay in Kaguya\'s view.</p><p>Natalia the blonde maid appears from a hidden door, she came here through the secret passages June made in the basement. She was just having tea in one of the hidden rooms in this basement, but she decided to come here when she saw the noise Violet was making.</p><p>\"What do you intend to do?\" Natalia asked.</p><p>Kaguya sighed and said:</p><p>\"As the perfect maid, I cannot let Lady Violet make a mistake that she will regret in the future. After all, the maid must always want the best for her master…\" She spoke in a neutral tone, then she continued:</p><p>\"Lady Violet is not taking the whole situation calmly, her obsession with Victor is clouding her judgment... The ritual is absolute, all three women must join Lord Victor, because if they don\'t Lord Victor may fall into a deep sleep, and the two women could also join him…\"</p><p>If that happens, Lady Violet will go mad… Kaguya can\'t help but think inwardly.</p><p>\"Sigh, this whole situation is complicated, especially considering this has never happened before.\" Natalia spoke in a neutral tone with a small sigh.</p><p>Kaguya nods, and soon she makes a decision: \"I\'ll get in touch with Lady Ruby and Lady Sasha.\"</p><p>Natalia the blonde maid who was wearing a French maid uniform said, \"Be careful with the church dogs when you go out.\"</p><p>Kaguya nods and disappears into the darkness.</p>'),(171,8,'Chapter 12 - A hard-working maid',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>On the rooftop of a twenty-story building was a maid with short black hair looking in the direction of a particular university, the university she was looking at was the same university Victor attended.</p><p>Despite being several kilometers away, Kaguya could see the college as if it were very close.</p><p>As she watched college, Kaguya began to think about what had happened in the past two days.</p><p>Kaguya wouldn\'t lie to herself, she was a little surprised at Violet\'s new husband.</p><p>\"At first, I thought he would run away when he saw my master\'s psychotic attitude,\" Kaguya commented to herself, after all, she knew Violet\'s personality well.</p><p>Kaguya was a new vampire by vampire standards, she was only 210 years old.</p><p>Since she became self-aware she has always been trained to be the personal servant of the Snow Clan leader or heir.</p><p>Kaguya is part of Clan Blank, a subsidiary family of Clan Snow, the two families have a blood bond that cannot be broken because Clan Blank\'s ancestor was one of the main members of Clan Snow who fell in love with a Japanese noble vampire. That is a story that happened over 1000 years in the past.</p><p>It is because of this ancestor that Clan Blank has some Japanese characteristics, Kaguya herself is a perfect example.</p><p>Kaguya did not inherit the Snow Clan\'s flames, but she did inherit Snow Clan\'s immunity to the sun, and because of that immunity, Kaguya had to serve Clan Snow.</p><p>Normally, it shouldn\'t be like that, after all, Kaguya\'s ancestor was part of Clan Snow\'s main house, and he married a noble Japanese Vampire who could control the shadows. But, because of the untimely death of Kaguya\'s ancestor\'s wife, the descendants of the noble vampire were left without political support and, because of that, they were demoted to a subsidiary family that exists only to serve the Snow Clan.</p><p>What about Kaguya\'s ancestor? He didn\'t care. The moment he found out his wife died, he disappeared and left his children in the care of Clan Snow. For Kaguya, this was really a tedious story, a story from a second-rate movie; because of a vampire\'s decision, an entire bloodline was doomed to live eternally serving a Clan.</p><p>\"Nice job, huh?\" kaguya thought aloud with a small smile on her face.</p><p>Kaguya had always wanted to be the \'perfect\' maid since she was a little girl, in a way she was just doing it to be praised, it was like a child who was trying to get the attention of her parents, but her efforts were never recognized...</p><p>When Victor said \'good job\', for a moment, she remembered her childhood; just for a moment, she felt happy.</p><p>But it\'s not all flowers, reality soon hit her when Violet called out to her. Kaguya exhibited a small disdainful smile: \"Heh, I think, in the end, the stalker found a good man, maybe I should work a little harder.\"</p><p>Kaguya had a secret... a secret of her own. At first, she didn\'t like Violet... Wrong, she didn\'t like the Snow Clan\'s heir. She didn\'t like to feel trapped by the duty that was placed on her from birth; she liked being a servant, but she didn\'t like to feel attached to someone.</p><p>\"The perfect maid can freely choose the master she wants to serve... Unfortunately, I\'m far from being the perfect maid.\" Kaguya spoke with a shrug as she made a bored gesture as if she had no choices.</p><p>But soon she assumes her blank expression: \"But as Lady Violet\'s personal maid I can\'t let her make a mistake she\'ll regret in the future. After all, I can\'t be a perfect maid, but at least I am a hardworking one.\" She chuckled a little to herself, and soon she jumped in the opposite direction to the university that Victor studied.</p><p>...</p><p>\"You guys really went to buy... I thought you were kidding\" I said, surprised and a little disbelieving what I was seeing in front of me. I was looking at my mom and dad who bought several boxes of fireworks.</p><p>\"Why do you have that dead fish face?\" She asked me, and then she still doesn\'t give me time to answer anything: \"Oh, you always have that look on your face, I\'m sorry… Anyway! We have to celebrate! You have no idea how much I wanted a daughter-in-law so I could cuddle and cuddle!\" My mother spoke with a smug face.</p><p>\'Why are you treating my wife like she\'s your daughter!?\' I can\'t help but comment internally.</p><p>Suddenly my mother ran towards the kitchen, and started looking for someone; she looked like a child who acquired a new friend and wanted to play.</p><p>When she saw Violet who was looking into the kitchen like she was looking at her archenemy, she ignored Violet\'s expression and hugged her!</p><p>Violet makes a surprised expression, but soon she smiles softly and turned to look at my mom, \"Lady Anna, what are you doing?\"</p><p>\"Wrong, wrong. Wrong, wrong.\" She spoke the same word over and over while shaking her head. \"You are my son\'s wife, so you must call me Mom!\"</p><p>Violet looked shocked at my mother.</p><p>Violet was a tall woman, she was 180 CM tall, compared to my mom who was 170 CM tall, so from my perspective seeing my mom hugging Violet, was a bit comical. She looked more like a younger sister to Violet than my mother.</p><p>\"...Mother...?\" Violet spoke with a difficult expression, it was like a person who had never spoken those words before in her life.</p><p>\"Umu, Umu,\" My mom breaks away from Violet and nods with a satisfied expression. \"That still wasn\'t enough but I realize you\'re uncomfortable, so I won\'t force you into anything.\"</p><p>\"It\'s not that... It\'s just...\" Violet was going to say something, but she was silent; it seems she must have some family issues.</p><p>\"Shh, don\'t worry, everyone on this planet has secrets, even my son and his wife.\" My mom spoke with a meaningful smile.</p><p>Violet smiled a little with a grateful expression.</p><p>\"But anyway, why were you looking at the kitchen like it was your archenemy?\" My mom asked curiously and, as always, she was brutally honest.</p><p>Violet\'s expression takes on several shades of red, she ducks her head in embarrassment and pouts, \"I...I was never good in the kitchen, and...and I wanted to make Victor something to eat.\"</p><p>Mom and I looked at Violet in shock.</p><p>Suddenly my mom starts hugging Violet tighter: \"Kyaaaa!!! You are so beautiful my god!! My son hit jackpot!\"</p><p>Violet\'s face is completely red and she looks to me for help, but I just shrug like it has nothing to do with me.</p><p>She suddenly takes on an expression of someone who has been left to survive alone in the wild, sorry my wife but I want you to be my sacrifice to my mother.</p><p>And, looking at the small smile on Violet\'s face, I can see that she\'s not disliking my mom\'s attitude; she\'s just a woman who isn\'t honest with her feelings (although she\'s surprisingly honest when it comes to me).</p><p>\"I decided!\" My mom suddenly stops hugging Violet and yells, then she continues, \"I\'m going to teach you how to cook!\"</p><p>When I heard my mom\'s words I couldn\'t help but wonder about the doubt I had when I heard Violet was bad at cooking, can vampires eat regular food?</p><p>\"Really?\" Violet asked with bright eyes.</p><p>\"Of course, let\'s go!\" Suddenly my mother pulls Violet by the arm and leads her into the kitchen, soon the two women start talking.</p><p>\"You found a good wife,\" my dad said as he was leaning against the wall with his arms crossed.</p><p>I look at him, and see him smiling at me with a satisfied face.</p><p>I display a small smile, \"You\'re wrong, dad.\"</p><p>\"Hmm?\" My dad looks at me confused.</p><p>\"I didn\'t find her, she found me,\" I said.</p><p>\"...Women these days are more honest with their feelings, huh?\" He spoke with a small smile, then he crouches down and tries to pick up the boxes full of fireworks.</p><p>\"Leave it to me, dad,\" I said as I walked over and placed all the boxes piled on my shoulder, in total they bought three boxes the size of a normal microwave.</p><p>My father, seeing me putting all the boxes on my shoulder, couldn\'t help but smile at me satisfied: \"Now you can work as a bricklayer; you used to be very weak\"</p><p>Oof, I felt like someone had stabbed my heart with a stake. I look at my dad and think \'he\'s really going to ignore the changes in my body, huh? Or maybe he doesn\'t care?\'</p><p>Anyway, I appreciate that he\'s not asking anything.</p><p>As I carried the boxes into the living room, I asked my father, \"By the way, what took you so long?\" After all, it\'s already turned into night.</p><p>I seem to speak loud enough for my mom to hear because she stops talking to Violet and looks at me, \"We wanted to give you guys privacy, after all, you guys are supposed to be horny with each other, right? \"</p><p>\"Mother!?\" I looked at her in shock, Woman control your mouth!</p><p>\"I know this is normal, you two are young, etc.\" My mom spoke in a bored tone like it was no big deal.</p><p>\"Indeed, we enjoyed last night,\" Violet spoke with a smile on her face, she was saying that last night we sucked each other\'s blood but that only increased the misunderstanding.</p><p>My mom looks at Violet with shining eyes, \"Looks like I\'m going to like you even more than I already do! I found a partner!\"</p><p>\"partner?\" Violet questions confused.</p><p>\"Yes, do you know how difficult it is to be the only honest person in this house? My son is an antisocial man that if it weren\'t for my teachings, would have become a simp to some successful streamer.\"</p><p>Woman, why do you know these useless things!? I thought as I placed the boxes in the room.</p><p>\"Oh?\" Violet looks at me and I turn away, ignoring her. After all, there are some truths to my mom\'s words. I wouldn\'t become a simp because I didn\'t have money and I wasn\'t foolish enough to believe that if I gave these streamers some money, I could get in their pants. Besides, I didn\'t even have time to think about it because I was worried about my health and, in the past, I looked like a thin undead; I doubt any woman would be interested in me.</p><p>\"And my husband…well, he\'s my husband…\" She spoke in a flat tone, it was like she didn\'t have much to say about my father.</p><p>Well, in general, my father is a good father, he never missed anything at home and he was always there when we needed him.</p><p>\"Hey, woman! Don\'t dirty my image in front of my daughter-in-law!\" my father yelled.</p><p>My mom just sticks her tongue out to my dad.</p><p>Suddenly I smell the sewer stink again, those agents must have returned.</p><p>Honestly, I didn\'t have a problem with these agents, they were just doing their job but, for some reason, they stank like a sewer and that annoyed me.</p><p>I\'m just annoyed by the fact that I was having a good \'normal\' conversation with my family and suddenly someone seems to have opened the sewer in the middle of our house, it was just an irritating feeling.</p><p>\"Honey, should we get your things?\" I spoke out loud when I noticed Violet was starting to show her \'gentle\' face. I didn\'t want her to show this face to my parents. Although I think it\'s adorable, I don\'t know if my parents would like it and that was a gamble I didn\'t want to make (and I\'m self-conscious enough to realize that her face is scary for normal people... even though that expression is so adorable).</p><p>Hearing my voice, Violet controls her expression and smiles gently, \"You\'re right darling.\"</p><p>My mom makes a sad expression, \"Ehh? But we were having fun…\" She spoke while pouting.</p><p>\"Don\'t worry... Mother.\" She paused and spoke the last word with a hard face, she clearly wasn\'t used to saying that word, soon that expression fades into a kind face, \"I live near here, and I just need to get some more clothes.\"</p><p>\"I see... Well, take care and come back soon\" She spoke with a gentle smile.</p><p>\"I\'ll be right back mother,\" Violet said, she looked like she could say the last word a little easier now, she walked towards the door.</p><p>\"I\'ll be right back, Mister Leon,\" Violet said in a polite tone.</p><p>\"Just call me Leon,\" My dad said.</p><p>Violet nods her head smiling.</p><p>I look at my dad and say, \"I\'ll be right back, dad.\"</p><p>My dad nodded and said, \"Take care of yourself out there, son.\"</p><p>I nod my head indicating that I understand and then walk to the door, Violet holds my arm like a good wife and we walk out of the house.</p><p>When the door to the house closed, Victor and Violet suddenly disappeared.</p>'),(172,8,'Chapter 13 - Ruby Scarlett',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>Ruby Scarlett\'s House.</p><p>A beautiful woman with long red hair and a body that would be the envy of any model was sleeping soundly in a very ordinary-looking King Size bed, she was sleeping in a very comfortable position, it seemed that nothing in this world could interrupt her sleep.</p><p>\"Lady Ruby,\" Suddenly a woman\'s voice can be heard in the bedroom.</p><p>\"Ugh~\" Ruby gave a sign of life but continued to sleep. After all, she was fully convinced that no one would dare interrupt her sleep and she also knew that no one would dare attack her family and, because of that conviction, she could sleep as if she had no worries in the world.</p><p>\"Lady Ruby,\"</p><p>This time Ruby heard the woman\'s voice, but she was too lazy to get up. Though, for a moment, she thought this woman\'s voice was all too familiar.</p><p>Well, she was too lazy to think, so she decided to continue to sleep.</p><p>\"Kaguya, you\'re doing it wrong,\" Suddenly Ruby hears her personal maid\'s voice.</p><p>\"Oh? How do you wake up your master, Luna?\" Kaguya asked in a neutral tone.</p><p>Luna flashes a sadistic smile and approaches Ruby then she says, \"Ruby, I ripped up your entire personal anime collection.\"</p><p>Ruby suddenly opens her eyes and looks coldly at Luna, her personal maid.</p><p>\"You won\'t fool me again, Luna,\" Ruby said in a cold tone.</p><p>\"Eh? Tsk, looks like I have to find another way to provoke Lady Ruby.\" The maid spoke aloud with a pout.</p><p>Kaguya just looks at Luna with emotionless eyes. Luna was wearing a maid\'s uniform similar to Kaguya\'s, she has shoulder-length white hair, pale skin like all vampires, and pink eyes. She was a Russian woman with a height of 180 CM</p><p>Kaguya looks at a specific part of Luna; Huge as always, she thought disdainfully.</p><p>Luna\'s most outstanding feature was her huge breasts, just like Ruby who had the biggest breasts Kaguya has ever seen, Luna didn\'t seem to lose in this competition.</p><p>\'Now that I\'ve stopped to think about it, all the women of Lady Ruby\'s Clan have huge breasts,\' Kaguya commented to herself.</p><p>\"Ugh~, I wanted to sleep...\" Ruby complained, she sat up in bed.</p><p>When Kaguya sees Ruby\'s breasts dangle in the red nightgown she was wearing, she can\'t help but think \'Maybe I should just let Lady Violet kill this woman?\'</p><p>Ruby looks at the guest and says, \"Oh, Kaguya... How long has it been since we have last seen each other,\" she said with a gentle smile.</p><p>Seeing Ruby\'s gentle smile, Kaguya stops thinking about random bullshit. She knows that of the three women who are childhood friends, Ruby is the kindest, calmest, and the smartest person she knows, she also has nothing against this woman. ..</p><p>Boing! Boing!</p><p>Yes, she has nothing against-...</p><p>Seeing Ruby\'s breasts bouncing as she stretches on the bed, Kaguya pulls back everything she thinks and decides it\'s a good idea to let this woman die.</p><p>\"Kaguya~?\" Ruby spoke as she stretched.</p><p>\"Tsk,\" Kaguya didn\'t hide her annoyance, but soon her expression goes blank and she says: \"I came here to talk about Lady Violet\"</p><p>Ruby opens her eyes, a little surprised, but doesn\'t react too much, she expected something like this to happen. \"You came at a good time, I have something to tell you too.\"</p><p>\"Oh?\" Kaguya looks at Ruby with curious eyes.</p><p>Soon Ruby starts explaining to Kaguya about the noble vampire Corneliu Funar.</p><p>...</p><p>When Ruby finishes recounting the events that happened at the university to Kaguya, the black-haired maid only speaks in disdain:</p><p>\"A young noble vampire who thinks he\'s the center of the world and has an ego more fragile than glass? What is new?\"</p><p>Ruby nodded in agreement with Kaguya\'s words, \"But that\'s not the problem, what if Corneliu attacks him?\"</p><p>\"Oh? Oh?\" Suddenly Luna, who was silent, started to smile.</p><p>\"Lady Ruby won\'t call that man \'darling\' like Lady Violet?\"</p><p>Ruby turns to face Luna and says in a cold tone, \"Silence.\"</p><p>Luna\'s body suddenly stops moving and she says, \"Yes, Lady Ruby,\" she spoke in a neutral tone like a robot.</p><p>\"She doesn\'t learn, huh?\" Kaguya spoke in a bored tone. Since the moment she met Luna, this woman has always liked to tease Ruby. Ruby is a kind person and doesn\'t like to use \'master\' status to force Luna to do things, but Luna knows no limits; she likes to tease Ruby in any situation. That\'s inappropriate behavior for a servant, after all, the servant cannot tarnish her master\'s reputation.</p><p>\"Yes, I don\'t like to do that, but she doesn\'t know how to control her mouth.\" Ruby sighed.</p><p>Kaguya nods in agreement, but then she says, \"About Corneliu; Lady Ruby, no need to worry\"</p><p>\"Why don\'t I need to worry?\" Ruby asked confused.</p><p>\"Because Lord Victor can handle it,\" Kaguya spoke in a neutral tone, but Ruby could see she was confident Victor could handle it.</p><p>\"Huh? But, he\'s a newborn, and a newborn can\'t fight a noble vampire who\'s been roaming the world for over 50 years. Even though Corneliu is weak by noble vampire standards, he\'s still a noble vampire, a newborn vampire can\'t handle him.\" Ruby explained her reasoning.</p><p>Kaguya ignores Ruby\'s reasoning, and asks, \"Lady Ruby, have you forgotten what we are?\"</p><p>Ruby opens her eyes for a moment when she understands what Kaguya means.</p><p>Kaguya flashes a cold smile, \"We are vampires. We are not like wolves that take care of each other, if Victor dies fighting Corneliu, that means he wasn\'t as special as Lady Violet always said.\"</p><p>\"Indeed,\" Ruby said with a cold smile, but soon she continues with a gentle smile, \"But I don\'t intend to become a widow before meeting my husband\"</p><p>\"And as a perfect maid I can\'t let my master be sad, after all, a maid must always prioritize the best for her master,\" Kaguya commented with a small smile on her face.</p><p>\"Looks like we\'ve agreed on something,\" Ruby said with the same smile.</p><p>\"Indeed,\" Kaguya agreed.</p><p>\"But I didn\'t come here to talk about it.\" Kaguya suddenly changes the subject, \"I came here to say that Lady Violet\'s possessive attitude has been getting out of hand since the moment she met Victor… And she will probably try to kill you without worrying about the consequences\"</p><p>\"I know...\" Ruby commented with a sad smile. \"I\'ve known her since she was little, I know how crazy she can be when someone takes something that belongs to her, and honestly? I guess Sasha and I shouldn\'t have been there when Victor was turned. After all, he was someone Violet had always been watching since she was a child.\" Ruby puts her hand on her neck and suddenly her eyes change to blood red, a bloody atmosphere started coming out of Ruby\'s body, and slowly, it felt like Ruby\'s room was getting colder; it was like the temperature suddenly dropped into the negatives.</p><p>\"But I don\'t intend to give up either, what happened in the ritual can\'t be undone and I can\'t go into hibernation because of a little mistake like that. I have a lot of things I want to do in the future yet… if Victor does become my darling, and when he becomes my darling, he\'ll have my full support for whatever he wants to do in the future.\"</p><p>Ruby\'s smile grew unnaturally, and her sharp teeth started to show. She was no longer a kind woman, she seems to have changed to something much worse in just a few days...</p><p>And, Kaguya noticed this change, outside Kaguya had the same blank expression, but inside she couldn\'t help thinking \'For god\'s sake, another one? Does Lord Victor\'s blood have properties that turn female vampires into stalkers?\'</p><p>\"I understand, I\'m leaving,\" Kaguya said when she turned around, she had fulfilled her goal.</p><p>Ruby seeing that Kaguya was leaving returned to her gentle appearance, \"Are you going to visit Sasha?\" she asked curiously.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Kaguya said.</p><p>\"Be careful with Sasha\'s new maid, she\'s... special,\" Ruby warned her.</p><p>\"What happened to the former maid…\" Kaguya asked as she turned and looked at Ruby and, seeing Ruby\'s sad look, she said, \"She died…?\"</p><p>\"Yes... She was murdered by the dogs of the church,\" Ruby spoke in an angry and at the same time sad tone, she knew Sasha\'s maid, Julia. She always talked a lot to Julia when she went to visit Sasha.</p><p>\"...I see,\" Kaguya spoke in a neutral tone, but Ruby could hear some sadness in her voice. Soon the shadows started to engulf Kaguya, and she disappeared.</p><p>Seeing that Kaguya is gone, Ruby looks at Luna then her eyes change to blood red for a moment, and soon Luna starts acting normally.</p><p>\"Sorry about that again, Luna.\"</p><p>\"It\'s okay, I know I go overboard sometimes,\" Luna commented with a small smile on her face.</p><p>\"Sometimes?\" Ruby raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\"...\" Luna used her right to remain silent.</p><p>Ruby sighs and looks at her watch, seeing it was eight o\'clock in the morning, she thinks \'it\'s still too early, my university starts in the afternoon and I\'m too lazy to make arrangements to avoid sunlight when I go out...I think I\'ll just sleep again.\'</p><p>Ruby lays on the bed and pulls her sheet to cover her body, the moment she lays down she feels thirsty, when she feels this craving for blood that can\'t be satiated by ordinary blood, she can\'t help cursing Violet \'that bitch, she\'s got her thirst quenched but she doesn\'t think about the consequences, does she want my darling to go into a coma?\'</p><p>Ruby\'s eyes kept changing red and green, she was trying to resist the bloodlust.</p><p>\"Lady Ruby...\" Luna spoke worriedly.</p><p>\"It\'s okay, Luna. Soon this problem will cease to exist,\" Ruby spoke while still lying down, as soon as she covers the sheet up to her head she closes her eyes. She was trying to sleep while ignoring her bloodlust which seems to be increasing with each passing day.</p><p>Luna looks at Ruby worriedly, she can\'t help but think inwardly \'that\'s bad, if it goes on like this Lady Ruby could lose control or go into a sleep state... I need to do something.\'</p><p>Luna was thinking about what she could do to help Ruby, but she couldn\'t find any ideas in her head when, suddenly, she has a brilliant idea \'I\'m going to get in touch with Ruby\'s mom!\'</p><p>...</p><p>Two tall men were walking down the street as they were looking around. They were wearing two full black priest\'s robes, but unlike normal priest\'s clothes, these men\'s clothes were designed for combat and easy movement. Around these men\'s necks, a small white crucifix can be seen.</p><p>The two men appeared to have Western features, one had dark black hair and brown eyes, the other had light brown hair and black eyes.</p><p>While the black-haired man had a simple cut, the brown-haired man had a bowl-shaped haircut.</p><p>\"Thomas, what are we doing? We\'ve been down this street about five hundred times! For the love of our father, let\'s get out of here!\" The brown-haired man spoke impatiently.</p><p>\"Shut up, Dick-Head! I feel those evil creatures around here, I smell the stink!\" Thomas the black-haired man spoke with conviction.</p><p>When the brown-haired man hears what Thomas said, he is furious: \"Don\'t call me Dick-Head! I have a name that God gave me! My name is-\"</p><p>\"Yes, Yes, whatever. Come on Dick-Head, the equipment is feeling something over there,\" Thomas said as he pointed to a street.</p><p>\"HEY!! Do not ignore me!! And we\'ve been down this street before!!\" Dick-Head spoke.</p><p>\"Strange, this is state-of-the-art equipment, is it defective?\" Thomas spoke as he looked at the device in his hand, the device was shaped like a wooden crucifix.</p><p>Dick-Head approaches Thomas and looks at the equipment, he suddenly gets angrier: \"This is not state-of-the-art equipment! This equipment was used during the hunting of vampires in the 18th century! For the love of God! Where did you get this!?\"</p><p>\"Huh? I got it from the church warehouse, it said equipment for tracking vampires!\"</p><p>\"...Did you look at which version of the equipment?\"</p><p>Thomas turns his face away: \"...Yes...\"</p><p>Veins start popping in Dick-Head\'s head. \"You\'re an idiot!\"</p><p>\"Are these the famous hunters from The Inquisition...?\" Victor who was watching these two hunters on top of a house asked as he looked at Violet who was standing next to him.</p><p>Violet turns her face away, and replies: \"...Yes\"</p><p>\"Are you sure?\" Victor looked at the two priests again and then looked at Violet who was ignoring him.</p><p>\"...Yes...I guess...\" Violet replied uncertainly.</p><p>Victor looked at the two priests again, and seeing them argue again, \"Are you absolutely sure they aren\'t two comedians dressed as priests?\"</p><p>Violet looks at the priests again, seeing how she had no way to explain the attitude of those priests, she uses her right to remain silent, but internally she was thinking, \'I evacuated the humans from the surrounding area thinking there might be conflict, but it looks like I\'ve done a useless job, these two hunters are still inexperienced... Does it look like they\'re on their first mission?\' She thought.</p><p>Victor looks at Violet for a moment and ignores her, then he uses his vampire vision and looks at the priests. Seeing the golden energy covering those priests, and feeling a little stink of sewage emanating from them, he confirms for the tenth time they are vampire hunters...</p><p>Sigh...!</p><p>Victor couldn\'t help but sigh.</p><p>\"No need to be disappointed, Darling! There are experienced hunters! Maybe in the future, you\'ll find other hunters better.\" Violet starts talking quickly as if trying to cheer him up.</p><p>Victor looks at Violet confused. \"I\'m not disappointed by that, I\'m just disappointed that these two agents messed up our moment along with this stink of sewage, I was hoping they would be more...competent?\" He explained.</p><p>\"Oh... On second thought... They messed up our moment together, huh?\" Remembering that she was about to finally catch up with Victor and those two hampered him with their stink, the anger she\'d previously felt returned explosively, Violet suddenly starts to emit a bloody pressure.</p><p>Victor seeing Violet\'s bloodthirsty expression thought she was very beautiful, but he also thought \'Fuck, she\'s going to kill them…\'</p><p>When Violet disappears, Victor also disappears; while watching her, he was thinking \'I can\'t let her kill those agents, I need to know their goals in this town.\'</p>'),(173,8,'Chapter 14 - Thomas and Jimmy',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>Thomas and his friend also sense Violet\'s killing intent, they stop arguing and assume a serious expression: \"Jimmy!\"</p><p>Dick-Head, now known as Jimmy said, \"You only call my name in this kind of situation, Asshole!\"</p><p>Jimmy takes a bible from the little bag he was carrying then he opens it and puts his hand on the pages of the bible, and begins to speak, \"Oh my lord, please forgive these corrupt souls, and bless your lost lambs in this battle to come.\"</p><p>A golden light descends on Jimmy and Thomas. At that moment Thomas grabs the crucifix that was around his neck and yells out, \"I am the man chosen by God to be His messenger!\" Suddenly Thomas\'s crucifix changes its appearance and, slowly, a western sword forms in his hand. This sword had a normal appearance, but the blade was strange, the edge of the blade seemed to be covered by some kind of golden light.</p><p>Violet appears beside Thomas and, just as she was about to kick him, she is stopped by a golden barrier.</p><p>Violet pulls away and looks at her feet that were a little bruised, but soon are cured by the vampire\'s abnormal regeneration then she looks at Jimmy with a murderous glare.</p><p>When Thomas sees Violet\'s red eyes and her pale complexion, he yells with a hateful smile.</p><p>\"Vampire!\"</p><p>\"We\'ve actually found a Vampire…and it\'s still morning…\" Jimmy opens his eyes wide as he realizes that only one coven of vampires could walk in the sun without worrying.</p><p>\"Thomas, we must run quickly, we need to get away!\"</p><p>\"Huh? Why!? We have a vampire here, let\'s kill her!\" Thomas yelled.</p><p>\"Fool! Look at the situation calmly, she is a vampire but she is walking around in broad daylight! Only one-\" Suddenly Violet appears at Jimmy\'s side again and attacks him, intending to rip his head off.</p><p>\'She\'s trying to eliminate me!\' Jimmy jumps back in an attempt to dodge, then pulls holy water from his bag and throws it to the ground.</p><p>He holds up certain pages of the bible and shouts, \"Michael! Guardian Prince and Warrior, defend me and protect me with Your sword. Don\'t let any harm come to me!\" Suddenly a golden sword falls from the sky and appears in front of Jimmy, the sword was giant and it seemed to be made of pure golden energy.</p><p>Violet quickly backs away, jumping back when she realizes she couldn\'t kill Jimmy in time, since she doesn\'t want to take Jimmy\'s attack. \"Oh…? You\'re talented.\" She displayed a small predatory smile that showed off her sharp teeth.</p><p>\"I don\'t want compliments from a demon like you!\" Jimmy yelled.</p><p>\"How rude, have you ever seen such a sexy, beautiful demon like her?\" Victor suddenly appears on top of a fence while sitting down looking like a Japanese delinquent.</p><p>Jimmy turns when he hears another voice, then he looks at Victor and, seeing the predatory smile on Victor\'s face and his red eyes, Jimmy felt a shiver down his spine. \'Another vampire who can walk in the sunlight, they are from that Clan of cursed nobles! We don\'t have a chance here, we need to retreat!\'</p><p>Thomas seeing that a new vampire appeared, and realizing that he was closer to him, exhibited a hateful smile: \"God, bless this little servant with a strong body immune to fatigue. In this way, his servants will fight countless battles!\"</p><p>Thomas\'s body began to glow, and the golden light from the sword that was located on its blade began to glow brighter.</p><p>\"Thomas! Don\'t do it, you fool! Damn it!\" Jimmy yelled angrily when he saw what Thomas was about to do. They shouldn\'t be fighting this battle, we should have backed off and told the superiors that there are vampires from that cursed Clan in this town!</p><p>Thomas suddenly disappears into golden light.</p><p>\"Hmm?\" Victor looks to the side and sees that Thomas was approaching, \'Is he aiming for my head...?\' From Victor\'s perspective, Thomas was still very slow, he also felt that the golden energy coming out of Thomas\' sword was dangerous.</p><p>\"Ahhhhh!! Give me your head!!\" Suddenly Thomas\' speed increased explosively and he swung his sword towards Victor!</p><p>Victor jumps up calmly and dodges Thomas\'s attack, but suddenly he feels like his face has been scratched? \"Ugh\" What is this pain? It is like I\'ve been burned from the inside? It\'s like thousands of ants are biting my face at the same time.</p><p>He touches his face and thinks, \'I\'m sure I dodged it, I\'m not foolish enough to let that energy hit my body, but how did he hit me?\'</p><p>\"Thomas! You fool! Control your energy correctly! You missed a chance!\"</p><p>\"Ugh! I know!\" Thomas spoke as he avoided hitting a wall in front of him. He managed to stop in time to avoid being smashed against the wall, he stopped in front of the wall and started breathing heavily. He had used all his energy in that attack, this was an attack that could cause permanent damage to an ordinary vampire.</p><p>\'Oh, can he control the energy any way he wants? This is interesting, it means that if he was an experienced hunter I would have lost my head. I understand. I understand.\' Victor thought with a neutral face.</p><p>He was learning a lot from this situation, but he also felt strange; the longer this \'battle\' dragged on he was getting calmer and calmer. He was feeling very strange, he thought the first time he fought while in control of his actions he would be more scared, but instead of scared, he is feeling very calm; he can\'t explain to himself why he is feeling that way.</p><p>Suddenly a bloody pressure exploded around everyone, Victor, Thomas, and Jimmy look at Violet in shock and her expression was distorted into pure hatred.</p><p>\"YOU FUCKERS!!\"</p><p>BOOOOOOM!</p><p>A pillar of fire burst from Violet\'s body like a volcano that had erupted.</p><p>She puts her hand to her face like she\'s possessed by something while mumbling loud enough for everyone to hear.</p><p>\"HOW DARE YOU!? HOW DARE YOU!? How dare you hurt my beloved, Darling!? You mother fucking pigs!!\" How could Violet allow this? Her beloved Darling was hurt by mere pigs! They\'re just food for vampires, how dare they!?</p><p>\"T-That fire…\" Thomas spoke with an expression of fear.</p><p>\"I warned you! We should have backed off! We don\'t stand a chance against someone from that cursed clan! You never listen to me!\" Jimmy yelled as he kept his attention on Victor who was wearing a gentle smile and Violet who had a hateful expression.</p><p>Looking at the pillar of fire that Violet was producing, all that was on Jimmy\'s mind now is to run away. He was extremely terrified since he provoked a monster that he shouldn\'t provoke!</p><p>\"Hahaha,\" Victor suddenly started to laugh lightly when he saw Violet\'s face. She was very adorable to him and, because of that, he was laughing with happiness.</p><p>Jimmy and Thomas looked at Victor like they were looking at a madman, how can he laugh in this situation?</p><p>\"Why are you laughing!?\" Thomas yelled annoyed as he watched the cut on Victor\'s face abnormally heal, he was internally surprised by this, \'our god\'s energy healed so easily!? Is that the power of a noble vampire?\'</p><p>Jimmy, when he heard what Thomas said, looked at Thomas with murderous eyes. He promised himself he would part with Thomas if he survives all this, that man is just too stupid!</p><p>\"Hmm? Why am I laughing? I really do not know...? I just felt like laughing, so I laughed…\" Victor lied easily, he looks at Violet with a loving smile.</p><p>\"Isn\'t she beautiful? Tell me, have you ever seen a woman more beautiful than her?\" Victor asked while smiling.</p><p>\"Huh...?\" The hunters\' brains stopped working for a few seconds. They looked at Violet, saw her hateful expression, and they couldn\'t help but think, \'Is that beautiful? Was this vampire\'s brain melted by the previous attack?\'</p><p>Victor ignores the hunters and walks towards Violet then, when he gets close to Violet, he lightly touches her face. Strangely the fire didn\'t burn him, he just felt comfortable as if it was natural for him.</p><p>Violet slowly starts to ignore the hunters and looks at Victor with murderous eyes, suddenly she feels something invading her mouth.</p><p>\"Hump-!\" Feeling something wet invading her mouth, and realizing what Victor was doing, Violet\'s hateful expression slowly began to melt and her cheeks slowly began to turn a shade redder.</p><p>Tongues have started dancing in Violet\'s and Victor\'s mouths, but that doesn\'t last long; when Victor separates a bridge of saliva forms, then he flashes a gentle smile.</p><p>\"Are you calmer?\"</p><p>\"Y-yes,\" She spoke with red cheeks as she turned her face and smiled a little, happily.</p><p>Victor laughs and pats her head. He finds the raw change in Violet\'s personality adorable, one moment she\'s a vampire killer, and the other moment she acts like a teenager who\'s in love, and he loved that trait of Violet.</p><p>Suddenly, Victor looks at the two agents who were slowly trying to get away. Seeing that Victor looked at them, the hunters couldn\'t help but speak in fear, \"Oh Shit.\"</p><p>Victor hears footsteps approaching and he decides to leave the scene; although Violet has evacuated the surrounding area, the fire that Violet invoked drew a lot of attention, \"Honey, get that boy with bowl hair and I\'ll get Thomas. Do as I say, okay?\" he spoke with a gentle smile.</p><p>\"Y-yes, D-Darling,\" she commented stuttering, while her expression was a little red with embarrassment.</p><p>Victor uses his speed, and he disappears beside Violet then reappears beside Thomas.</p><p>\"You-\" Thomas was going to say something, but Victor kicked him in the face and put him to sleep he then picks Thomas up like a sack of potatoes and disappears.</p><p>Violet appears alongside Jimmy but, unlike Thomas, Jimmy can\'t resist being taken away. \'God, please protect this lamb that is being kidnapped to the devil\'s lair\'</p><p>...</p><p>In an abandoned building on the outskirts of where Violet and Victor\'s battle took place.</p><p>I throw the hunter named Thomas to the ground, when he falls to the ground he suddenly wakes up while yelling, \"Ouch!\"</p><p>Violet came right behind me and threw the hunter named Jimmy to the ground. \"Ouch!\" he started to massage his ass.</p><p>I notice that Violet is staring at Thomas with a murderous look so I move closer to her and start stroking her head, \"How are you feeling?\"</p><p>Her expression softens and she bites her lip in frustration, \"I\'m angry, I want to kill him! He hurt my, Darling!\"</p><p>I nod my head several times as if I\'m agreeing with what she said, but actually I was thinking it\'s a good thing she\'s letting off steam. After all, if you hold too many emotions bottled up in your body, you can go crazy. Venting is a good thing, especially for vampires who feel emotions more strongly than humans.</p><p>Did she get that way for just a little cut...? I can\'t help but hug her in happiness!</p><p>\"Humpf?\" Violet made a weird sound as I hugged her and put her head on my chest. When she realized what I did, the rest of her turned bright red and it seems like smoke started to come out of her head, a phenomenon that happened due to her powers, I think...</p><p>I realize she was breathing heavily, she was embarrassed but she seemed to like my scent.</p><p>\"I like when you are mad for me, but you can\'t lose control like that.\" I drop her head from my chest and gently take her face in my hands then I make her look at me, \"Thanks for being mad for me, but don\'t lose control of your emotions in battle.\" I spoke in a definite tone not allowing refusal. I may not be battle savvy, but one thing I\'m sure of, losing control of emotions in a battle with hunters who were bred to exterminate vampires is foolish.</p><p>\"I, I w-will try not to lose control~\" She replied while breathing heavily, I could see her face was very red.</p><p>I laughed a little, \"I\'ll also try not to lose control of my emotions,\" Wow, I sound like a hypocrite now, I tell her not to lose control of emotions but I also don\'t know if I can control my emotions in the middle of battle.</p><p>I say this for the simple reason that I don\'t know my current self, sometimes my emotions seem out of control like in the Luan incident and sometimes my emotions are calm as a lake, this is just incomprehensible to me.</p><p>Normally, I would be able to control my emotions, that was something I learned from my mother. But, since I became a vampire, I don\'t recognize myself anymore, easy things that I could do before like controlling emotions are no longer easy and became more difficult, this was a very strange situation for me.</p><p>But I realized something, I\'m only forced to demonstrate my true self when I have personal grudges with the enemy, or when I think the opponent is strong enough to face me.</p><p>I didn\'t know I was a battle maniac? Actually, what am I? Hmm.</p><p>Let\'s think about possible situations so I can form a coherent train of thought.</p><p>The first situation, Luan. I had a grudge against him, and because of that, I felt great when I humiliated him.</p><p>The second situation, The Inquisition. The moment I realized the hunters couldn\'t give me a challenge, I lost interest, and I calmed down...</p><p>Heh… I\'m changing... I\'m changing too fast and I don\'t know what\'s going to happen when my evolution stops, what am I going to become? I can\'t help but display a predatory smile that shows off all my sharp teeth as I imagine what I\'ll become when I stop evolving.</p><p>Seeing my smile, I can feel Violet shivering, and I can smell her scent that is leaking from her secret garden; she seemed to be excited.</p><p>\"Cough, hmm, can we leave?\" Hunter Jimmy asked in a shy tone.</p><p>Violet stops looking at me and looks at Jimmy with an annoyed look, I lightly patted Violet\'s head and pulled away from her.</p><p>Come to think of it now these two men are no longer reeking like sewage, what\'s going on? Was it the effect of that device they were using?</p><p>I smell the air a little bit and they don\'t stink at all… Stopping to think about it now, during the previous fight I felt their stink getting stronger, I think it\'s the energy they use that makes them stink like sewage for me and Violet?</p><p>I look at Jimmy and see that he has a red face, embarrassed at Violet and I\'s show of affection; I flash a small smile.</p><p>\"Not yet,\" I say.</p><p>\"Oh, I see,\" He spoke in a dismayed tone.</p><p>I laughed lightly, \"Don\'t worry, as long as you say everything you know you can get out of here alive, after all, your goal here isn\'t us, right?\"</p><p>Jimmy looks at me with an excited face, \"Yes! We came here to hunt a vampire named Lucy, he is wreaking havoc in the human world and some time ago he kidnapped several men and women-\"</p><p>\"Jimmy, what are you doing!?\" Thomas interrupts Jimmy.</p><p>Something happens that surprises Violet and me, Jimmy turns and looks at Thomas with an annoyed look, \"Shut fuck up, you fucking muscle brain!\"</p><p>\"...Huh...?\" Thomas didn\'t understand.</p>'),(174,8,'Chapter 15 - Jimmy is a smart guy',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>Something happens that surprises Violet and me, Jimmy turns and looks at Thomas with an annoyed look, \"Shut fuck up, you fucking muscle brain!\"</p><p>\"...Huh...?\" Thomas didn\'t understand why his friend reacted so strongly to his words. He was going to say something again, but he decided to keep quiet because he saw the look Jimmy was giving him, it was a look that said \'shut up and let me figure this out! \'.</p><p>\'Well, this is interesting; Jimmy seems to be a smarter man than Thomas who only acts out of emotion\', I thought as I looked at the two hunters standing in front of me.</p><p>\"Like I was saying…\" Jimmy looks at me and flashes a \'gentle\' smile, then he continues with bright eyes, \"Sir Vampire, we\'re just here to hunt down the vampire named Lucy!\"</p><p>I had already deduced that, \"Oh? Who is participating in this hunt?\" I ask curiously; Jimmy seemed to be very willing to cooperate.</p><p>\"Me, this idiot here, and three more veteran hunters. A man named Carlos Reiss, he\'s an American vampire hunter, and a woman named Mizuki, she doesn\'t have a last name that I know, she\'s a Japanese hunter.\" Jimmy spilled everything as if he were confessing his sins to a priest.</p><p>When Mizuki\'s name was mentioned I felt a slight tensing from Violet, so I looked at her. When she saw my look, she opened her mouth and began to speak.</p><p>\"Mizuki is a veteran hunter, she is one of the new generals of The Inquisition,\" She spoke in a neutral tone.</p><p>Then she continues, \"She can fight a vampire who is over 500 years old easily, the last report I heard about Mizuki was from Japan where she had single-handedly eliminated 10 Clans of noble Vampires. Japan\'s noble vampires aren\'t as strong as those in the Romanian community, but even so, that\'s an impressive feat.\"</p><p>\"How many generals are there?\" I ask curious, I was surprised by the fact that it seems like humans have strong people on their side.</p><p>\"Four, each general is an exceptional force that can fight 1000+-year-old vampires easily, they are the strongest humans alive…\" Violet seemed to praise them for a moment, then she continued.</p><p>\"I don\'t know how they do it, but it looks like The Inquisition is getting stronger as time goes on.\"</p><p>Hmm, historically speaking, humans always adapt against the threats they faced, so it\'s no surprise they\'re getting stronger, but I\'m pretty sure the methods they\'re using to get stronger aren\'t nice for the people involved. After all, humans can commit the greatest atrocities for the greater good.</p><p>Jimmy suddenly began to speak out loud.</p><p>\"It is clear! The generals are God\'s chosen warriors! They have eternal youth and many God-given abilities! Ahh~ Father bless this lost lamb,\" he spoke like a fanatic as he looked up at the roof of the abandoned building and clasped both hands together in a gesture of prayer.</p><p>\'Chosen by god, huh?\' I thought with a little skepticism. \'Does the god he talks about so much exist? Why didn\'t he eliminate vampires? After all, he was supposed to be a powerful being, right?\' I think someone is using the name of God to bring people together to fight for their organization\'s goals… Well, this wouldn\'t be the first time in history that someone has used the name of God to do something like that.</p><p>\"And? The last hunter, what\'s his name?\" I ask Jimmy.</p><p>Jimmy stopped praying and looked at me, \"It\'s not him, it\'s her\"</p><p>Then he continues, \"Her name is Maria, she is an American woman and also Carlos\' partner, but she is missing.\"</p><p>Hmm, Maria, Carlos, and Mizuki... Three strong hunters and two beginners. They are putting a lot of effort into hunting Lucy, as I believe that just Mizuki\'s presence alone would be enough to eliminate Lucy, he didn\'t look like a strong vampire.</p><p>I start to reflect on the information I obtained and I can\'t help but think of something.</p><p>The situation has changed... This is becoming a dangerous game, and interesting... I can\'t help but smile a little when I think about it.</p><p>But then I put my hand to my face and think; \'when did I start having suicidal tendencies? And, why am having fun with this situation?\' I\'m a newborn vampire, if I were to confront these hunters I would just die like a pig being slaughtered, I need to control myself!</p><p>I start thinking about what I should do next, then I look at Violet who\'s been staring at me for a long time and she says, \"We can\'t let them go anymore.\"</p><p>I nod in agreement with my wife\'s words, it looks like she had the same thought as me.</p><p>\"Ehhh? Why, but we told you everything we know! Please do not kill me!\" Jimmy spoke in despair.</p><p>I look at Jimmy and I can\'t help but think he\'s very cowardly and at the same time very smart, he prioritizes his life and doesn\'t mind selling out his allies to live on. He\'s the perfect example of a soldier that you wouldn\'t want around in your organization. By comparison, Thomas is a loyal man, and hotheaded; he is a perfect pawn...</p><p>\"Just out of curiosity, did you choose Thomas as your partner?\" I asked with genuine curiosity as I pointed at Thomas.</p><p>\"I didn\'t choose him! God chose us to be each other\'s companions!\" Jimmy said annoyed, he seemed to have spent a lot of time with Thomas.</p><p>Oh... Now, I get it. They brought the two together on purpose, they hoped that Thomas\' loyal personality would pass on to Jimmy, after all, people are influenced by other people.</p><p>It seems that \'God\' is a very cautious being.</p><p>\"Well, I apologize, Jimmy. I can\'t let you go, after all, the situation has changed but don\'t worry, we won\'t treat you badly\" I said with an innocent smile.</p><p>I appear next to Jimmy and try to test something I\'ve wanted to for a long time, and now we have the perfect guinea pig here. \"Look into my eyes.\"</p><p>My eyes turn blood red. \"You will do whatever I order, okay?\"</p><p>Soon I hear Violet, \"That isn\'t going to work, Darling. They have something that prevents them from being enchanted.\"</p><p>\"Oh?\" I look at Violet.</p><p>\"We\'ve never found out what it is, but The Inquisition has ways that can prevent vampires from enchanting the members-\" She suddenly stops talking when she hears Jimmy say:</p><p>\"Yes, I will,\" Jimmy spoke with blood-red eyes.</p><p>\"…Huh…? Darling! What did you do?\" Violet asked excitedly.</p><p>\"I-\" I was about to answer Violet but Thomas, who was just silently looking at us with hate, yelled.</p><p>\"I\'m going to kill you, bastard! What did you do to Jimmy!!\" He looked at me like I was his mortal enemy.</p><p>... This man has a very big hatred, huh? Looks like something happened in the past, I can guess what happened just from the look of hatred he has for me, looks like he\'s a victim of vampires.</p><p>\"Oh my god, please-\" As he was about to start speaking the incantation I appeared in front of him and, grabbing him by the neck with my right hand, held him in the air.</p><p>\"Just shut up, and obey me for now, okay?\" He looked into my red eyes, and soon his eyes turned red.</p><p>\"Yes,\" He spoke in a mechanical tone as if he had no life.</p><p>I drop him gently to the ground.</p><p>Looking at the two hunters, I display a small smile. I was still curious about some things, especially about the spells they did in the last fight; I\'ll make them tell me everything I want to know.</p><p>\"Let\'s get them to your mansion, I don\'t want potential enemies in my parents\' house,\" I say.</p><p>\"I was thinking the same thing, Darling.\"</p><p>...</p><p>Sasha House.</p><p>\"I heard what happens, Lady Sasha,\" Kaguya spoke in a neutral tone with a little sympathy as she looked at Sasha.</p><p>She was currently in a luxury hotel room, precisely speaking, she was on the 25th floor of a luxury hotel in a presidential suite. She was looking at a blonde woman with short hair and blue eyes that were constantly changing from red to blue, it was quite obvious to Kaguya that Sasha was bloodthirsty.</p><p>Sasha has a voluptuous body, big breasts, but not as big as Ruby\'s, and pale skin, but the feature that draws the most attention is her ass and her legs, which were very thick. If Ruby had the biggest breasts, Sasha had the biggest ass and leg Kaguya had ever seen.</p><p>\"And...? Did you come here to give me your pity?\" She spoke with cold, tired eyes.</p><p>Kaguya shakes her head, and asks in a neutral tone, \"What happened?\"</p><p>\"This is not your problem,\" Sasha spoke coldly.</p><p>\"Wrong,\" Kaguya said coldly as her eyes changed to blood-red.</p><p>\"I\'ve known Julia longer than you, she was like a teacher to all the maids who served the houses of the four vampire earls... Just like she was a teacher to me, she was a mother to you, this is my problem too.\"</p><p>Sasha opened her eyes a little, and spoke in a sad voice, \"...I understand...I\'m sorry.\"</p><p>Kaguya was silent for a moment, she wasn\'t very good at comforting a person, \"What happened?\" She asked again in a neutral tone.</p><p>Sasha\'s eyes that had been alternating between sapphire blue and blood-red suddenly turn red, and then she orders, \"Maid!\"</p><p>A blonde maid gently opens the door of the room she was in, walks slowly towards Sasha\'s side, and stands beside Sasha waiting for any order from her master. From beginning to end, all her movements were very robotic, it was quite clear that Sasha was abusing her status as \'master\'.</p><p>Kaguya looks to the side and sees the blonde woman with her hair tied in a low bun; she has blue eyes and a serious expression. Her outfit is a maid\'s uniform similar to the one Kaguya wears and she wears long black gloves so as not to directly touch her master, Kaguya could also see with her vampire vision small threads surrounding the woman as if they were protecting her.</p><p>When the maid appeared, Sasha began to speak, \"After the ritual took place, I went home,\" she started to describe what happened.</p>'),(175,8,'Chapter 16 - Ambush',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>January 31st, the day the ritual that turned Victor into a vampire took place.</p><p>Sasha\'s POV</p><p>\"I do not believe this! I do not believe this! It\'s all Violet\'s fault, that stupid stalker!\" I said as I jumped from building to building and held my neck, my breathing was ragged and my mouth was oozing blood from that newly transformed human.</p><p>Ahhh~, this blood tastes so good, this blood makes those sack drinks that my family provides taste like nothing, the best blood I\'ve ever tasted and now it\'s mine? Is this just mine?</p><p>I shake my head several times to get that thought out of my head then stop on top of a building and look up at the cloudy sky, I sigh and say:</p><p>\"I can\'t believe I\'m married to a stranger...\"</p><p>I mean, Victor is not a complete stranger, Violet has always talked about him to Ruby and me since when we were kids. We always had to listen to Violet talking about her \'Darling\'.</p><p>Honestly, when I was a kid I found this very irritating, but as time went on I got used to Violet\'s craziness.</p><p>\"I accepted the request to help with the ritual, but I never thought something like this would happen,\" I said as I crouched down and sat in the building.</p><p>\"I mean, who would have thought this would happen!? Shouldn\'t the ritual be individual!? Why did this irregularity happen!? Because of that now, I\'m married! And I don\'t even know my husband personally!\" I practically yelled as I held my head in frustration.</p><p>It\'s all Violet\'s fault!!</p><p>Ohhhh! I\'m getting annoyed again!</p><p>\"Wait…\" Suddenly, I realize something important, \"If I don\'t take my husband\'s blood, I\'ll dry up… I\'ll turn into a dry mummy, and my body will go into hibernation… and that is still a positive result. In the worst case, I\'ll go crazy from bloodlust...\"</p><p>\"FUUUUUCK!\" I yelled in frustration, how am I supposed to make this work!? \"Hey, Victor, I am your wife? Give me your blood!\" I spoke like I was acting in a drama, but soon my face turned bright red.</p><p>NOOOOOOOOO! This is shameful! I never met him in person! I shake my head several times to get that thought out of my head.</p><p>Anyway! I must go home!</p><p>I get up and jump towards a mansion I bought.</p><p>...</p><p>Arriving at the mansion, I open the door and the first thing I see made me freeze in disbelief, my maid Julia\'s headless body was sprawled on the couch. The room was messed up, it was like a fight had happened, and it wasn\'t just Julia\'s body that was scattered.</p><p>\"N-N-No, J-Julia...?\" I spoke in disbelief, I couldn\'t form coherent thoughts when I saw the body of the maid who practically raised me since I was little.</p><p>I could see the bodies of all my servants, vampires, and humans... A massacre took place here while I was gone.</p><p>I didn\'t have time to be in mourning because I felt someone approaching at high speed, I covered my body with my lightning and dodged the attack.</p><p>The attack passes by me and I can see the door to my mansion breaking into pieces.</p><p>\"Oh? The ambush failed, that\'s too bad.\" I hear a man\'s voice, looking at the man I see he\'s a tall bald white man and he\'s wearing a priest\'s robes, but it looks like it\'s been adapted to look like a black suit.</p><p>\"Church dogs,\" I growled in anger, but soon I swallow that anger and try to stay calm; now is not the time to lose control, but I can\'t, I can\'t control my anger. Seeing the body of my headless mother, a burning fury I can\'t control escapes my body.</p><p>\"You FUCKERS!!!!\"</p><p>Boooom!</p><p>Lightning started to cover my entire body.</p><p>The man ignores me and pulls tight the black glove he was wearing in a gesture as if the glove was loose, he stands like a martial artist and says, \"God bless this servant\'s fist so he can punish sinners. \"</p><p>When the man said this, his fist began to glow with a faint golden glow.</p><p>When I try to move using my legs, I feel my movements being restricted. \"Success, good job Carlos.\" Suddenly, a woman who was wearing a nun\'s dress appears, same as the man, it looks like her uniform was tailored to look like a tight-fitting suit. I could see in her hands she held several strands spread all over the mansion, they suspend me in the air in a way that I look like I\'m on a crucifix.</p><p>\"Nice job Maria,\" Carlos spoke in a neutral tone, \"Honestly, I don\'t want to deal with the heiress of Clan Fulger, those rays are quite incompatible with my fighting style.\"</p><p>\"Indeed, you\'re lucky to have me as your partner, or you could never capture her alive,\" Maria said.</p><p>\"You are my lucky charm,\" Carlos praised her with visible feelings, they seemed to have something together.</p><p>My anger reached the boiling point when these dogs treated me like I was easy prey to hunt, they invade my house... They kill the woman who was like a mother to me, they kill my servants and still despise me!? Unforgivable!</p><p>\"CHURCH DOGS!\" I screamed angrily, my teeth started to change and got sharper then a bloody pressure started to leak out of my body. I\'m going to kill them!</p><p>\"Sigh, I knew it wouldn\'t be that easy,\" Carlos grumbled as if it were troublesome.</p><p>\"Indeed, she wouldn\'t be the heiress of a count clan if she was weak,\" Maria supports him, she gestures with her hands, and the wires that were holding me start to get tighter, but I also felt my skin burning.</p><p>\"Ahhhhh!!\" I cry out in pain, I look at the strands and realize they have a slight golden glow. Realizing I was at a disadvantage while fighting indoors with this woman, I made a decision... A decision that hurt my pride, \'I need to run away, I can\'t fight alone now\', I needed to run away...</p><p>I needed to run away, I know I needed to, but... I look at Julia\'s headless body and seeing that the rage that was running rampant started to rise again. I was angry, I was angry, I want revenge!</p><p>I focused my gaze on Maria, with the previous demonstration, it\'s pretty obvious that the bald guy has feelings for Maria. I flash a smile almost on the verge of insanity and decide to use a technique my real \'mother\' taught me.</p><p>Covering my body with golden lightning, I start to force my body to go beyond the possible limits of a noble vampire. I feel the rays entering my body and affecting it with small jolts of electricity, this is a self-destructive technique that only can be used by me, this technique expands my speed above the limit of sound.</p><p>I kick the air with my legs, and suddenly they both hear a sonic boom.</p><p>BOOOOM!</p><p>I feel the woman\'s strands snapping, and releasing me. When I\'m released, I use my speed and appear behind Maria, I was tempted to finish Carlos now, but when I saw his body being covered by dense golden energy as I ran, I changed my mind... And this decision to kill Carlos here wouldn\'t satisfy me, he needs to suffer, he needs to see his mate become something he hunts.</p><p>I bite Maria on the neck, and when she realizes what\'s about to happen, she screams.</p><p>\"Nooooo!\" I hear Church Hound\'s desperate cry and it made me bite her neck even harder and make her scream even more.</p><p>\"MARIA?!!\" Carlos ran towards us, but the moment he wanted to act to help Maria, I disappeared.</p><p>\"Cursed be the vampires!!!\" The Church Hound\'s scream was ironically like a devil\'s scream, and I don\'t know why, but I start to laugh out loud and with tears in my eyes, \"Fuck you, shitty dog!\" I yelled as I fled.</p><p>A few KM away from Sasha\'s mansion.</p><p>Sasha throws Maria on the ground and tears off the crucifix that was around Maria\'s neck, then she bites her finger and a drop of blood falls to the ground, when this drop falls to the ground, a magic circle is formed. \"I didn\'t prepare the proper materials for you to become my full-fledged servant, but who cares? With this you\'ll become what you hate the most, a vampire, and worse than a normal vampire, you\'ll become a defective vampire.\" She spoke with a smile that showed all of her sharp teeth as tiny tears fell from her face.</p><p>The last vision before Maria fell into unconsciousness was the image of Sasha smiling at her with a crazy smile as tears fell from her face.</p><p>...</p><p>Kaguya listened to the whole story from Sasha\'s mouth in silence, from beginning to end, Kaguya\'s expression didn\'t change, but Kaguya\'s indifferent atmosphere suddenly exploded with killing intent when she heard the state of Julia\'s body.</p><p>Kaguya looked at Maria, the former vampire slayer who has now turned into what she swore to kill. Kaguya\'s expression remained indifferent, but her atmosphere said everything she needed to know, she\'s furious.</p><p>Maria, Sasha\'s new maid, just looked at Kaguya with serious eyes, it was like she wasn\'t affected by Kaguya\'s pure intention to kill, but if we looked with sharper eyes, we would all be able to see small beads of sweat falling from Maria\'s face.</p><p>Maria\'s instincts were screaming for her to do something, but unfortunately, the master\'s order was absolute. She couldn\'t do anything, since the moment she became Sasha\'s servant the noble vampire always had her on a tight leash, she always ordered her to stay close.</p><p>\"A trap... The church dogs are more active than I thought, something is going on behind the scenes,\" Kaguya spoke in a neutral tone as she looked at Sasha, her killing intent suddenly disappeared, but Sasha could see by the look in Kaguya\'s eyes that her anger has not yet ceased.</p><p>\"Yes, according to my maid, a man named Lucy stole something very valuable from the church. Unfortunately, I couldn\'t get information on what that \'something\' is, my maid didn\'t know anything,\" Sasha spoke neutrally while showing disdain for the word \'my maid\'.</p><p>\"Are you sure about that?\" Kaguya questioned her.</p><p>Sasha decides to demonstrate with actions, she looks at Maria, then Sasha\'s eyes start to sparkle: \"Tell me what you were planning to do with your lover.\"</p><p>\"We were planning to get married and have kids next year,\" Maria spoke in a robotic tone as her eyes glowed red, Sasha\'s smile grew into a hateful smile when she heard these words, she seemed to be planning something and Kaguya noticed this smile.</p><p>\"When you killed my former head maid, what did you feel? And what was your purpose in making that trap?\"</p><p>\"Nothing, I feel nothing. After all, this is just a job, Carlos attacked the mansion head-on and killed all the servants, while I ripped the vampire maid\'s head off and set a trap with my wires, our goal was to capture the heiress of the Fulger clan\"</p><p>\"Stop, I get your point,\" Kaguya spoke in a neutral tone, she understood why Sasha was demonstrating this to her, Sasha wanted to tell Kaguya with these actions that the new maid was in her control.</p><p>\"Oh? But now it was getting to the good part.\" Sasha spoke like this was all a big joke, she obviously wasn\'t right in her head.</p><p>\"Continue, why did you want to capture me?\" Sasha ordered.</p><p>\"The Inquisition received information that the leader of Clan Fulger lost his position as a vampire count and became an ordinary noble vampire. The inquisition decided it would be a good opportunity to further weaken this Clan by capturing their heiress who was located in the United States of America.\"</p><p>Kaguya opened her eyes wide when she heard what Maria said.</p><p>Seeing the shocked expression on her always stoic face, Sasha can\'t help commenting in a broken tone as her eyes constantly change from blood red to green, \"Yes, funny, right? My parents will lose the earl title, my mother probably must have done the stupid things she always does, and in the end, I think she bet our title on some stupid game made by the nobles.\"</p><p>\"And because of that, these idiots here thought it would be a good idea to capture me and use me as a bargaining chip so they can further diminish the strength of my Clan, and you know what\'s funny?\" Sasha spoke.</p><p>\"If these church dogs had been successful, my parents wouldn\'t care about my existence, they would say I was weak or something and that I should die. A very funny situation, right? The only people who cared about me died because of those idiots who call me daughter.\" Sasha spoke dismissively.</p><p>\"Lady Sasha,\" Kaguya didn\'t know what to say.</p><p>\"I don\'t want your pity-\" Sasha was about to say something, but suddenly she realized that Kaguya was standing beside her while her body was hidden by the darkness.</p><p>\"I\'m sorry, Lady Sasha,\"</p><p>\"Huh-?\" Sasha just stared into Kaguya\'s glowing red eyes with a shocked expression, she never thought Kaguya would do that to her.</p><p>Kaguya slits Sasha\'s neck, and blood sprays her face, soon Sasha falls to the ground as if she were dead.</p><p>Kaguya disappears again, and appears behind Maria, then attacks the maid\'s ribs with shadowy daggers after which she slashes Maria\'s neck.</p><p>Maria\'s eyes suddenly lose the glow of life and she falls to the ground.</p><p>\"Sigh, it\'s hard to be a perfect maid,\" Kaguya sighs as she wipes her face with a handkerchief she took from her pocket and suddenly her shadows start to grow and slowly swallow Maria, then Maria\'s body disappears into Kaguya\'s shadows.</p><p>Kaguya turns her face away and looks at Sasha\'s body as several thoughts run through her head.</p>'),(176,8,'Chapter 17 - She is your wife',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p>Pov Kaguya.</p><p>Sigh, it\'s hard to be a perfect maid, I can\'t let myself think about it again as I look over my shoulder and see an all-black bag made of a material that keeps sunlight out. Inside that bag was Lady Sasha, a friend From Lady Violet\'s childhood; I could put Lady Sasha in my shadow, but that would be pretty rude to her, after all, my shadow isn\'t a nice place...</p><p>Sigh. I can\'t help but sigh again.</p><p>A maid\'s duty is to always want the best for her master, this was a teaching that Julia always put in my head when I was younger.</p><p>Julia was a role model for all maids, a maid considered to be perfect who trained all maids serving the households of noble vampires of count status. She was Sasha\'s personal maid, she was also the head maid of the Fulger clan and, most importantly, she was also like a mother to Sasha herself.</p><p>\"Losing a mother figure, and finding out your family lost their count status in the nobility must have been quite a shock to Lady Sasha,\" I mumble under my breath with a little pity as I bounced from building to building; I was coming back to Lord Victor\'s house.</p><p>Lady Sasha is not in a good mental condition, she is normally a noble woman, calm, and someone who follows the rules of the vampire world faithfully. But, when she went through several losses in a short time her mental state was affected and she was not thinking clearly.</p><p>If I left Lady Sasha alone she would make a rash decision that could cause her death, and if Lady Sasha died, Lord Victor would likely lose himself in bloodlust or fall into a deep sleep.</p><p>After all, the ritual is something that cannot be broken; to prevent the worst fate from happening the three women must stay together because if they don\'t, they will suffer.</p><p>Lord Victor needs his wives\' blood and his wives need Lord Victor\'s blood, and since Lady Violet is Lord Victor\'s wife, I need to resolve this situation...</p><p>\"Sigh… Should I really look for another job? Maybe I can go back to Japan and teach younger maids in the future,\" I spoke out loud, but I knew that was not what I wanted. I want to be a perfect maid, and a perfect maid is one who chooses her master, but it seems I was far from that goal... Maybe Lord Victor will praise me for doing a good job...?</p><p>I shake my head several times to get this thought out of my mind, not noticing that my face is a little red, I keep jumping from building to building.</p><p>...</p><p>Victor POV.</p><p>Violet and I returned with the two hunters to her mansion. After quizzing the hunters about their abilities and everything I could know about the techniques they use, I was satisfied when I finished my interrogation.</p><p>I left the two hunters in the care of Violet and Violet\'s servants, I told her not to treat the two badly, after all, we could use them as a bargaining chip for veteran hunters. Although I doubt these veteran hunters will care about their recruits they are still a \'good\' organization, right? So they should keep up appearances I think.</p><p>Good, and Evil are subjective; if I do good for one person and at the same time I harm another person, even if I don\'t know I did it, for the person I harmed I will be considered \'evil\', and for the person I helped, I\'ll be considered \'good\'.</p><p>In the end, there is no good and bad, what exists are just choices and the consequences of your choices</p><p>As Newton said in the past, for every action you make a reaction is created at the same time, that thought can be included in real life too and not just in physics.</p><p>Before leaving the mansion, I told Violet to bring more clothes than usual because I would use that excuse at home. After all, I know my mom, I\'m sure she\'ll ask why Violet didn\'t come home.</p><p>Violet agreed with me and said she would.</p><p>Returning home, I meet my parents, \"Where\'s Violet?\" My mom asked me, she was watching a movie while my dad was washing the dishes, apparently, they bought food.</p><p>In our house there\'s no such nonsense about the man sitting on the couch and the woman washing dishes, we divide our tasks into weekdays, it seems like today is my father\'s day to wash the dishes.</p><p>\"She\'s a little busy, she lives in a mansion so she has a lot of clothes to bring,\" I spoke in a neutral tone.</p><p>\"...You really hit the jackpot, you got a rich, beautiful, and loving wife... I have nothing more to teach you, as a mother, I\'m proud! As expected of me,\" My mother commented proudly of me as a small tear fell from her face, she looked like an ancient master who taught their disciple everything they learned and was proud of their disciple.</p><p>\"Mother...\" I was speechless as I looked at my mother.</p><p>\"I mean, if it were up to your father, you would work as a bricklayer and you would whistle to women passing by on the street. You would be a caveman, I don\'t want my son to be like that.\" She spoke with a serious face as if she were teaching me something important.</p><p>\"Oof.\" I saw my dad react like a knife had gone into his chest.</p><p>\"Woman, why did you agree to date me back then if I was a caveman!?\" My dad practically yelled as he stopped washing the dishes.</p><p>My mom turns her face and looks at my dad, and responds with the same honesty she always has, \"Well, you were tall, muscular, and knew how to treat a woman well ... And your dragon warrior was a great warrior too.\"</p><p>\"Anna\"</p><p>\"Leon\"</p><p>The two looked like two teenagers in love.</p><p>\"Okay stop, I don\'t want to hear about that,\" I said while making a stop gesture. I was used to this casual exchange from my parents, but even though I am used to it, I don\'t want to see it!</p><p>Suddenly, Kaguya walks through the door of the house and, when she closes the door, she calls my parents\' attention.</p><p>\"Mister Leon, and Mistress Anna, I came back sorry for the delay.\"</p><p>\"Oh, Kaguya, right? Where were you, I haven\'t seen you all morning.\" my mom asked.</p><p>\"I was solving some problems that Lady Violet forgot to deal with,\" Kaguya spoke in a neutral tone.</p><p>\"Oh, good job! As expected of a professional maid, you guys are different.\" My mom praised her honestly.</p><p>It seems that my mother\'s compliment seemed to work because Kaguya flashed a small satisfied smile and spoke in her usual neutral tone as she seemed to puff out her chest, \"This is easy for me.\"</p><p>\"Umu, Umu! Get in the house, let\'s talk!\" My mom spoke with a big smile as she invited Kaguya to her side.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, I can\'t do that right now, I\'m working,\" Kaguya said as she grabs my arms.</p><p>I\'m a little surprised by Kaguya\'s attitude.</p><p>\"Oh?\" My mother displays a meaningful smile.</p><p>I look at her smile and immediately understand what she\'s thinking; are you after another girl? What if Violet finds out about this? Be careful, I won\'t meddle in your personal life, but I don\'t want a child killed by their wife!</p><p>How do I know she specifically said that? Well, in the past, she and I talked a lot about the future and, she said those exact words; she said she wouldn\'t meddle in my personal life, after all, I would be an adult in the future, she just didn\'t she wanted the tragedy she saw in an anime to be repeated with her womanizing son...</p><p>I felt a lot of damage that day when she said the word \'womanizing\', at the time I couldn\'t even catch a fly, let alone catch a woman.</p><p>\"Lord Victor, we have a problem,\" Kaguya spoke in a low voice as she looked at me with a serious expression.</p><p>Seeing Kaguya\'s serious expression, I understand that something serious has happened and Kaguya needs me for something. After all, she\'s a serious maid, and she wouldn\'t make a joke about a problem. I nod my head indicating that I understand, and I tell my parents, \"I\'ll work something out with Kaguya, I\'ll be back soon.\"</p><p>\"Take care~\" My mom spoke as she waved at me, but suddenly she makes an expression like she remembers something and she yells, \"Victor! You should go get Zack from the vet, he must be missing you!\"</p><p>\"Oh!! I had completely forgotten about my cat.\" I smack my hand over my head, now that I\'ve stopped to think about it, I\'ve been missing stroking that fluffy fur. Deciding that I would pick up Zack from the vet later, I went out with Kaguya.</p><p>When Victor left his house with Kaguya, they entered a secret passage that was close to a wall, and soon they slowly descended into the basement of the house.</p><p>\"Do you think Victor is doing things with Kaguya?\" Leon asked curiously when he saw the house door close.</p><p>\"I doubt it. I know my son, I raised him to be a loyal man; he won\'t run after another woman if he\'s married to a woman as beautiful as Violet, something probably happened.\" Anna, Victor\'s mother, spoke with an unconcerned expression.</p><p>\"I see,\" Leon said and then continued washing the dishes. \"Wait, they\'re married, right? But why was there no wedding ceremony?\" He spoke as he washed the dishes, but when he realized what he was saying, he looked at Anna.</p><p>Suddenly Anna looks like she\'s been struck by lightning, she freezes and looks at Leon with shining eyes, it was like she had something interesting to do.</p><p>Leon, seeing this, just thought; \'Oh shit, I\'m sorry, son.\'</p><p>...</p><p>\"...I didn\'t know maid work included kidnapping beautiful women, is that a new kind of fetish?\" I asked Kaguya who ignored what I said while looking at the two blonde women who were sleeping in two separate beds, the first blonde woman was wearing a modern maid dress that looked like Kaguya\'s.</p><p>And the other woman... She was beautiful... Unlike Violet, she had short blond hair that reached her neck, very pale skin, thick thighs, and big breasts.</p><p>she was wearing a long-sleeved black silk shirt with a two-button collar that goes to the middle of the neck, between her breasts there was a white square-shaped tile embroidered on the edges in gold, it looks very tight and, since it is silk, and you could completely see her round breasts and her very slim waist. What was even more surprising was the white sailor-like coat with a bow tie tied just above her breasts, just leaving the white coat over her shoulder without actually wearing it.</p><p>She wore a white skirt with two belts, one at the waist and one falling more diagonally on the right side, it was cut like those cheongsam dresses and showed off a sexy black garter belt that covered her long, perfect legs.</p><p>I noticed she was also wearing white 2-inch high heels, but the heels were leaning against the side of the bed.</p><p>This woman was very attractive, I feel my vision changing, and I look at her and feel the same thing as when I saw Violet for the first time. It was an inexplicable attraction, it was like I needed to suck her blood, \" Ugh.\" I put a hand to my throat and walk away quickly.</p><p>looking at my reaction to seeing the blonde woman for a long time, Kaguya spoke in a neutral tone, \"You\'re reacting to her, huh?\"</p><p>\"Who is she?\" I asked as I held my heart, I thought I had quenched my bloodlust with Violet, but why was I reacting so strongly?</p><p>Kaguya doesn\'t answer me, she looks at the woman who\'s been lying in bed for a long time and I see her hesitate as if she\'s making an important decision, in the end, she seems to make up her mind then looks at me and speaks in a serious tone of voice, \"She\'s your wife.\"</p><p>\"...Huh?\" I look at Kaguya in shock with my mouth agape.</p>'),(177,8,'Chapter 18 - Sasha Fulger',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p> \"She is your wife.\" Kaguya repeated what she said in the same tone of voice. </p><p> \"That I heard,\" I said in a surprised tone, I took a deep breath and asked in a neutral tone. </p><p> \"What I meant was, what do you mean she\'s my wife?\" </p><p> \"...Well, she is your wife?\" She spoke with a confused face. </p><p> \"Kaguya,\" I stared at her with a look telling her to explain what was going on. </p><p> Kaguya sighed. \"Normally, as a servant of Lady Violet, I shouldn\'t be telling you this information, but…\" She bit her lip and it looked like she was having some difficulty speaking. </p><p> I start to think of Kaguya\'s personality, she is a loyal maid who claims to want to be the perfect maid, a maid who does everything for her master\'s sake; Oh, I get it, she\'s thinking she\'s committing a betrayal by talking about something Violet probably forbade. </p><p> I move closer to her as I try to ignore the temptation to bite the blonde woman\'s neck who was lying asleep on the bed, I swallowed hard and bit my lip a little. </p><p> I patted Kaguya\'s head and said, \"Don\'t worry, Just tell me what happened; if Violet says something, you have my support.\" </p><p> When I started stroking Kaguya\'s head I felt her body tremble a little, and then she shows a small smile on her face; she seems happy about something, then she says: </p><p> \"I will trust Lord Victor.\" She spoke in a neutral tone while keeping the smile on her face. </p><p> Realizing she was going to tell me what\'s going on I stop stroking her head; I feel her shiver a little, and suddenly Kaguya\'s hand moves at inhuman speed and takes my hand and places it on her head again. She then lifted her face and looked into my red eyes with a blank look. </p><p> Question marks started appearing around me, I didn\'t understand what was going on, but when I looked where she was holding my hand, I understood something; she wanted me to stroke her head. </p><p> Soon, I start stroking her head again and she displays a satisfied smile, I can\'t help shaking my head to myself when I see this maid\'s attitude; she claims to be a perfect and serious maid, but she is surprisingly cute sometimes. </p><p> Somehow, seeing Kaguya\'s expression, I managed to calm down. My bloodlust was still screaming like crazy, but now it was on a more manageable scale. </p><p> \"Explain what happened,\" I told Kaguya. </p><p> Kaguya nods and says, \"This woman\'s name is Sasha... Sasha Fulger, just like Lady Violet... She is your wife.\" Soon she starts telling me all the events that Sasha suffered. </p><p> I listened to everything with a neutral expression as I stroked Kaguya\'s head. My emotions fluctuated sometimes, when I heard that Sasha was happy, I was happy, but when I heard that Sasha was almost captured by the hunters, I felt a wave of intense anger in my chest. </p><p> These emotions were foreign to me. I wondered how I could feel such strong emotions from a woman I just met, but stopping to think,... The same thing happened with Violet; I always felt very intense emotions when involving Violet. </p><p> I look at the blonde maid with murderous intent, but soon I shake my head several times and start breathing heavily in an attempt to calm myself again; this wasn\'t my revenge, this was Sasha\'s revenge. </p><p> Okay, let\'s gather the important information, Sasha who is Violet\'s childhood friend was marked as my wife by the ritual that happened a few days ago. She came home and a trap set by the church hunters was waiting for her, on that day she lost Julia a maid who was like a mother to Sasha. </p><p> According to Kaguya, when she went to visit Sasha she realized she was suffering from bloodlust, and she was very weak from fighting the hunters. Realizing that Sasha might make rash decisions because of her desire for revenge, Kaguya kidnapped Sasha and brought her to me. </p><p> I understand the general situation, I look at Kaguya, \"Who is my other wife?\" </p><p> Kaguya bites her lip, but she soon sighs again and says, \"Ruby... Ruby Scarlett, she\'s Lady Violet\'s other childhood friend.\" </p><p> Ruby... Ruby... Hmm, isn\'t she the most popular student in med school? Let me remember, red hair, green eyes, and with an always listless expression on her face, she was called a genius because she always came first in everything she did. </p><p> She was very popular with the college men, she was called the untouchable red flower. According to the rumors, in the past she was proposed to by several men but they were all turned down, and some more insistent men suddenly disappeared from the face of the Earth. </p><p> For some reason an irritating feeling grew in me when I realized that several men were after her, it was like an obsessive desire... Hmm, those fuckers- </p><p> \"Lord Victor.\" Suddenly I hear Kaguya\'s voice. </p><p> I wake up from my thoughts and look at Kaguya, realizing that I was falling into the seas of emotions again, I smile a little and say, \"Thank you, Kaguya.\" I stroke her head harder. </p><p> I see she was breathing more erratically, and she had a small smile on her face, she wasn\'t breathing like Violet, it was something quieter. </p><p> \"Nice job, Kaguya.\" I felt Kaguya\'s whole body tremble as I said those words, and soon she turns her face away and is looking at the wall as if she found something interesting. </p><p> Kaguya deserved those words, if she hadn\'t acted then, Sasha probably would have done something dangerous to herself. </p><p> \"Ugh-...what happened to me?\" </p><p> Suddenly, I hear someone\'s voice waking up, I look straight ahead and see that Sasha has woken up. </p><p> Sasha looks around and doesn\'t seem to recognize the place she woke up, suddenly she starts talking in an irritated tone, \"... That maid! She kidnapped me—\" She was going to continue to say something, but when she noticed my presence she stopped talking and focused all her attention on me. </p><p> Sasha\'s sapphire blue eyes begin to change to blood red, she inhales a large amount of air and slowly begins to release the air that was in her lungs. When she let out the air she breathed in, I could see that the air was much hotter than usual, it even formed a small hot mist when it came out of her mouth... </p><p> Her face started to turn red, and she started breathing erratically while keeping her red eyes fixed on me. </p><p> I wasn\'t in any better shape, my body was hot, my throat was dry, my whole body screamed at me to stop holding back and attack that woman and feast on her blood. </p><p> \"Ugh-... Lord Victor, you\'re hurting me.\" Kaguya spoke in a neutral voice. </p><p> When Sasha and I heard Kaguya\'s voice, we both woke up from our stupor. </p><p> I looked down and realized I was squeezing Kaguya too hard, I also noticed that Kaguya lied by saying she was hurt, I think she told me and Sasha that to wake up from our world. </p><p> \"...S-Sasha...Right?\" I said stuttering a little. </p><p> \"...Y-Yes, I\'m Sasha!\" She suddenly spoke out loud as she raised her hand like she was in elementary school and the teacher had asked her something. </p><p> Realizing what she had just done she turns her face to the side and ignores me, I noticed that her whole face was glowing red and seeing that expression of hers, something seems to pierce my heart and I can\'t help commenting in an honest tone: </p><p> \"Beautiful.\" </p><p> I hear a \'poof\' sound, and I see little yellow lightning flashing from Sasha\'s head, and her face is redder than before. </p><p> \"S-stop... D-Don\'t look at me!\" She screamed when she spoke the last sentence. </p><p> \"Lady Sasha, please calm down,\" Kaguya said when she willingly walked away from me and approached Sasha. </p><p> \"K-Kaguya, why did you bring me here!? I\'m not prepared mentally, physically, or emotionally to talk to him right now!\" She practically screamed with a face red with embarrassment. </p><p> Kaguya ignores what Sasha said, and says, \"Lady Sasha, you were planning some silly plan like using this maid as bait and trying to capture the man who attacked you, right?\" </p><p> Oh? That was also a possibility. </p><p> Sasha opens her eyes wide, she looked at Kaguya with a face that said \'how do you know that?\' Looks like Kaguya nailed her guess. </p><p> Soon her face twists into hate, \"Yes. So is this what you brought me here for? To stop me from taking my revenge?\" She spoke in a cold tone. </p><p> \"Wrong, I brought Lady Sasha here to strengthen herself,\" Kaguya spoke as she pointed her finger at me. </p><p> Sasha puts on a confused face then she looks at me, I notice her face turning a little red but she seems to control her expression now. </p><p> \"Lady Violet is getting stronger... Every time Lady Violet drinks Victor\'s blood, she is slowly getting stronger, she\'s probably stronger than Lady Sasha and Lady Ruby now.\" Kaguya spoke in a suggestive tone. </p><p> \"Do you understand? Violet is a noble vampire at just 21 years old, practically a newborn, and she\'s getting stronger.\" She continued to speak in the same suggestive tone. </p><p> \"How is this possible? Vampires only get stronger the older they are, or if they train their skills to the fullest, just like Lady Scathach.\" Sasha spoke with a shocked face as she mentioned a woman I didn\'t know. </p><p> Suddenly Kaguya\'s face changes to an expression of disdain, and she sighs, \"Sigh... Woman, are you deaf? I\'m saying Violet is getting stronger by drinking Victor\'s blood.\" </p><p> Sasha and I looked at Kaguya in shock but then, as if it were all a lie, she came back with her stoic expression and spoke in a suggestive tone, \"Does Lady Sasha understand what to do?\" </p><p> \"...Huh?\" Sasha was so surprised by Kaguya\'s sudden change of expression that she didn\'t hear anything. </p><p> \"Tsk, Tsk,\" Kaguya clicked her tongue in annoyance. Suddenly Kaguya\'s body turns to darkness and she disappears into the ground then appears beside Sasha, she grabs Sasha by the arms and throws her towards me! Instinctively, I opened my arms and Sasha fell into my arms. </p><p> \"Kyaa! What are you doing!?\" Sasha yelled as she glared at Kaguya. </p><p> Kyaa? That was a cute scream, I can\'t help but comment as I hold Sasha\'s waist; she was my height, and she smelled really good, I can\'t help but smell her neck. </p><p> Kaguya bows in a gesture of respect and says, \"Enjoy some time with your husband, Lady Sasha.\" Soon, she turns and walks towards the bedroom exit, and when she leaves the bedroom, she closes the door. </p><p> \"Huh...?\" She looked at Kaguya with an incredulous face, but she didn\'t have time to do much when she suddenly felt me sniffing her neck and holding her waist. I couldn\'t help it, when she got close to me, I couldn\'t hold out longer. </p><p> She turns quickly and looks at me and when our red eyes meet we couldn\'t control ourselves anymore. I see Sasha\'s teeth change and become sharper, she suddenly pushes me into the wall and tries to bite me, but I don\'t let her; I throw her to the ground and hold her arms while she wraps her legs around my waist and keeps staring at me with bloodlust. </p><p> I let go of her arms and she wraps her arms around my neck, I put my face to her neck, and then I bite her! </p><p> I also feel her bite my collarbone and start sucking my blood, suddenly an explosion of emotions and feelings are directed at me and, just like Violet, her blood was delicious! </p><p> If Violet\'s blood was like food made by the most renowned chef in the world, I think Sasha\'s blood taste the most natural? It was like I was living on an island in the middle of nowhere, and the boss of that island was a beast that had the most delicious meat in the world, it was a wild taste, it was an addictive taste! </p><p> As I drank Sasha\'s blood I could feel a weakened bond in my body start to get stronger, I could now \'feel and understand\' Sasha\'s whole existence; her feelings, her thoughts, I could understand them just as I understood Violet… I understood what kind of woman Sasha is… </p><p> Suddenly my world turns red, I realize it\'s the same as Violet, but unlike Violet, I could look around; this place looked like the supermarket I went to in the past when my mom asked me to buy food. </p><p> \"Are you sure?\" Sasha asked as she looked at me who was lying down, I had a huge wound on my arm like I was being attacked by the claws of a wild animal. </p><p> \"Yes, I will make him my \'Darling\',\'\" Violet spoke with a loving smile. </p><p> Sasha suddenly looks away and I follow her gaze, soon I see Ruby, a woman with long red hair, a voluptuous body, and green eyes, \"What do you think about this?\" </p><p> \"No matter what I think, Violet won\'t change her mind, we should support her; besides, I already brought the materials for the ritual.\" Ruby spoke in a neutral tone as she pointed to a black bag that seemed to be full of various items. </p><p> Sasha nods her head in agreement with Ruby\'s words then she looks at me, and says with a bit of pity, \"Well, you\'d better live like a vampire than become a being who stinks of wet dog.\" </p><p> Soon the vision changes and I\'m in the same building that I was transformed in, everything happens the same as what I saw in Violet\'s vision, but now I see what happened after I bit Violet. </p><p> I looked at Ruby and disappeared, Ruby tried to react and defend herself but it seems like I was faster, I appear in front of Ruby and pull her into a hug, then I bite her neck. </p><p> \"Ahh~~\" Ruby moaned as she wrapped her arms around my neck then I see Ruby\'s gaze turn into a hot and dangerous look, she smiles with a smile full of sharp teeth and bites me! </p><p> \"NOOOOO!\" Violet yelled in a crazy voice. </p><p> Violet suddenly looks at Sasha, her eyes glowing red, \"Run away from here now! Sasha! Run! NOW!\" </p><p> Violet uses her speed and approaches me; appearing beside me, she tries to separate me from Ruby, but it seems I was stronger and she couldn\'t separate me from Ruby. </p><p> \"Fuck!\" </p><p> Sasha who was looking at Ruby and me with shocked eyes, looks at Violet who was trying to separate me from Ruby with a confused face, \"Huh?\" I could see she was genuinely confused. </p><p> \"SASHA, RUN! NOW!\" Violet ordered this time as the atmosphere around her grew heavier and more dangerous. </p><p> Lightning started to appear around Sasha and she tried to run away, but ... </p><p> Suddenly, I disappear and appear behind Sasha, I grab her from behind and bite her neck. \"Ahh~~!\" Sasha moans while holding my head, suddenly Sasha\'s eyes turn blood red; I stop biting Sasha and she turns to me with a distorted smile showing her sharp teeth, she licks my neck with a sensual gesture to clean the blood, and then bit me! I also bite her while hugging her tightly. </p><p> \"BITCHES!!!\" Violet screamed in rage as the atmosphere around her started to heat up, she was very angry, her face was distorted in rage, and she was biting her lip in frustration. </p><p> With a gesture of her hand, Violet creates several fireballs around it. \"Die! Bitches!\" </p><p> I stop biting Sasha, and look at Violet as I open my mouth to say something… I can\'t figure out what it is because the world around me has started to fall apart. </p>'),(178,8,'Chapter 19 - Sasha Fulger 2',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p> I wake up from the memories Sasha\'s blood bestowed on me and stop drinking her blood; when I realize my bloodlust has weakened, I grab Sasha around the waist and lift her up. Since she was holding me with her legs I could lift her easily, so I sat down on the floor and placed Sasha on my lap. </p><p> I start stroking Sasha\'s golden hair, patiently waiting for her to be satisfied; she seemed to be quite weak, and one thing I noticed is that no matter how much Sasha sucks my blood, I don\'t run out of blood or get tired. I think this is because of the vampire regeneration? </p><p> I noticed that when I started stroking Sasha\'s hair she started sucking my blood more slowly, and she also adjusted her position to sit more comfortably. </p><p> A few minutes pass and Sasha stops drinking my blood; she licks my neck a little to clean up the remaining blood, leans back, then looks at me while keeping her arms around my neck. </p><p> Seeing that some blood was still on her mouth, I approach her face gently; Sasha closes her eyes and accepts my advances as I start to lick her mouth, and slowly, I kiss her. </p><p> I feel her body tremble a little, but she accepts my kiss and opens her mouth. </p><p> Soon our tongues dance in each other\'s mouths for a few seconds, and then I pull away from her. She lets out warm air from her mouth as she looks at me with her red eyes, her breathing was erratic and she seemed to be out of breath as she looked at me. </p><p> Seeing her blond hair as I looked into her eyes, I couldn\'t help but think, \'She is so beautiful\'. </p><p> Suddenly, I pull her head to my chest and start stroking her head. </p><p> \"Mm~\" She seemed to hold back a moan of satisfaction, I couldn\'t help but laugh and let out a relieved breath; I needed to calm down, \"Do you know that... We just met?\" </p><p> Sasha shivered slightly when she heard my words and I noticed her cheeks starting to get a little red; she looked really pretty. I picked up her hair that fell in her face and put it behind her ear, \"…I-I\'m not usually like that, it\'s because of the ritual…Yes! This is because of the ritual and because I was thirsty!\" </p><p> She sat up and spoke to me with a serious face, her expression would be convincing if her face weren\'t so red. </p><p> I flashed a small smile and I pulled her head to my chest again, then continued to pet her. </p><p> A few minutes passed and we were just enjoying each other\'s presence. I didn\'t have to say anything, after all, just like me, she knew everything from my blood; even though we just meet each other now, we seemed to have known each other for a long time. </p><p> \"Sigh...\" Sasha sighed a little, then she pulled away from me and slowly straightened her position. Then she lay down with her head in my lap and looked up at me with her blood-red eyes. </p><p> When I saw this scene I had a sense of déjà vu; \'I remember doing the same thing with Violet\', I thought. </p><p> Although with Violet, I was lying on her lap. </p><p> \"You know? Vampires bond really fast,\" Sasha said. </p><p> \"Oh?\" I got curious and soon I started stroking Sasha\'s hair again. </p><p> \"In our society, when a female vampire takes an interest in a male vampire the woman will chase the male trying to tie him up in marriage; it\'s the same with a male vampire who likes a female vampire,\" Sasha said. </p><p> \'A stalker society, huh?\' I couldn\'t help but think. </p><p> Then she continues: \"The same thing happened to my mother, she was the heiress of the Fulger family at the time, one fine day she saw my father, a blond vampire with blue eyes, and she became obsessed with him; the next day she kidnapped him and married him.\" Sasha spoke with a neutral face as she closes her eyes and enjoys my caresses. </p><p> \"My father\'s family had a much lower status than my mother, and vampires by nature are greedy; because of that, my father didn\'t complain much when he was kidnapped.\" </p><p> Jesus Christ... Wait, isn\'t this situation somehow familiar? I couldn\'t help but think to myself. </p><p> \"Fortunately my father was a noble vampire who had a stamina trait far above normal and when the two of them had a child… I was born. I got my mother\'s lightning bolt and my father\'s stamina, because of that, I can use my skills easily. If I only had my mother\'s lightning ability every time I used that power, I would be extremely debilitated, after all, the technique of my clan that uses lightning requires the vampire to have a strong body.\" </p><p> I didn\'t understand why she was telling me this, but I decided to listen in silence; she seemed to be venting her emotions. </p><p> \"Just because I was born with better lightning resistance, my mom and dad treated me like a fun object to quench their boredom; they did a lot of experiments for me to improve lightning control,\" Sasha spoke as if telling the story of someone else; she didn\'t seem to mind the story, but I could tell by her tone of voice that she\'s sad. </p><p> \"I went through a lot of \'training\'. They put me in an electric chair and they tested my resistance to electricity, they threw me under the sea and asked me to use lightning skills to see if I would come out alive; they used the excuse of \'training\' to experiment on me to satiate their boredom. After all, I, as a noble vampire, have a much higher regeneration than normal... I went through a lot of \'training\' and I almost died several times.\" She spoke the last phrase with a little pain. </p><p> \"But I held on, I held on until these two lost interest in me, and they were bored again.\" </p><p> Suddenly, a wave of emotions started to flood my heart, these emotions weren\'t mine… I bit my lip, and I tried not to demonstrate anything. </p><p> \"...And that was when I got my personal maid...\" She bit her lip and put her arm over her eyes and said in a shaky voice: \"Julia... She was like a mother to me, whenever I came home falling apart and almost dead, she would cure me and treat me like a real daughter...\" </p><p> I saw drops of blood falling from Sasha\'s face; I feel these drops of blood falling on my thigh, but I didn\'t care. I bit my lip and tried to remain neutral; I was feeling my heart sink and I felt like crying; it was a strange feeling, I seemed to be feeling all her emotions. </p><p> \"S-She taught me everything I know today, etiquette, education, the rules of the noble world, arithmetic, geography, vampire history... She even played with me using games created by humans, I really enjoyed playing chess with her. …She was a mother to me, a mother like my real mother never was.\" </p><p> \"I-I miss her~\" I felt all the pain and sadness of Sasha when she spoke those words, her body was visibly shaking and she looked very fragile. </p><p> \"...I-I miss her, I miss my mom…\" </p><p> \"I miss playing with her, I miss talking to her, I, I...\" She bites her lip and can\'t speak anymore, I feel her body shaking. Now, she didn\'t look like a dangerous vampire, she just looked like a child who lost her mother. </p><p> I bit my lip as hard as I could and I felt the blood pouring from my mouth, but I ignored it; I did my best to keep a neutral expression as I gently stroked Sasha\'s hair, \"You can cry Sasha,\" I said as gently as possible; I just wanted to lighten her burden a little. </p><p> \"Mm,\" She turned her face to the left and hid her face in my lap as she started to cry silently. Not wanting her to hide what she\'s feeling, I lift her up and put her in my lap then I hold her. I place her head on my chest and she hides her face as I feel the tears of blood wetting my shirt. </p><p> I ignored it and was trying to do my best to control my emotions. I was mad at Sasha\'s parents for what they did to her. </p><p> I was sad that Sasha had lost someone who was like a mother to her. I was disgusted by Sasha\'s parents for using their daughter as an object to quench their boredom. I was sorry for Sasha for having to deal with everything that happened to her. And, I had immense respect for Julia and everything she did for Sasha. </p><p> I had a lot of emotions running through my heart and I wasn\'t managing to deal with all of those emotions at the same time. For the first time, I understood the difficulty of controlling a vampire\'s amplified emotions. I could feel everything multiplied by 500x, and that wasn\'t an easy task. </p><p> I bit my lip with my sharp teeth; I felt blood pouring from my mouth and the pain I was causing myself, but I didn\'t care. I hugged Sasha gently as I stroked her head, I didn\'t want to say anything like \'it\'s alright\'; I didn\'t want to be a hypocrite with her. And because of that, I just decided to act as a support for her… Now, she just needs someone to vent her emotions. </p><p> Kaguya appears at the door and, seeing me hugging Sasha, she was going to open her mouth, but I just said: \"Leave.\" My voice came out more demonic than I intended. </p><p> Kaguya\'s eyebrows quivered for a moment, but soon she nods her head and leaves the room; I probably don\'t have a good expression right now. </p><p> ... </p><p> Kaguya POV. </p><p> Some time passed, and I was going back to the room I left Lord Victor in with Lady Sasha. When I reached the front of the room, I opened the door, and just as my eyes meet Lord Victor\'s red eyes, I feel my whole body paralyze. </p><p> Lord Victor\'s face was very cold and I felt my instincts screaming from danger, I also noticed that he was biting his mouth very hard and he was hugging Sasha very protectively. </p><p> \"Leave.\" </p><p> Hearing Lord Victor\'s order, I felt my whole body demanding as if I had to obey. It was like a primordial urge telling me that I shouldn\'t deny this order because, if I ignored it, something really bad would happen. Lord\'s order Victor was absolute; if he ordered me to do something, I must obey. </p><p> I nod in agreement, and immediately I leave the room. The moment I\'m away from the room, I stop walking and regain my consciousness. </p><p> \"W-What happened?\" I couldn\'t help but ask aloud in shock as I looked towards the direction of the room where Lord Victor was. </p><p> ... </p><p> A few minutes pass and Sasha stops crying, she looks at me with the face of a person who has just cried a lot. </p><p> \"I\'m sorry-\" Before Sasha can say any nonsense, I put my finger to her mouth in a silent gesture, \"Shh… Everything is fine… Everything is fine, okay?\" </p><p> \"Mm,\" Sasha nods her head and I bring my hand to her face; when she realizes my hand is on her face she puts her head in my hand. I laughed a little, and slowly started to wipe the bloody tears from her face. </p><p> \"Weird…Why do I feel so safe with you?\" She asked in a confused voice as she looked into my eyes, I could see her eyes had turned sapphire blue. </p><p> \"I\'m just built different,\" I said with a small smile. </p><p> She laughed a little when she saw my unintentional joke, but I also noticed that her emotions calmed down a little when she laughed. She seemed to be fine, I could feel her heart was serene, but I also felt immense anger hidden by all that serenity. </p><p> \"Violet and I will help with your revenge,\" I said in a gentle tone. </p><p> She looks at me with a serious face, \"I-\" </p><p> \"I know,\" I said with a small smile. </p><p> \"Huh?\" She made an expression showing she didn\'t understand. </p><p> \"You want to avenge your mother alone, right? You would probably tell me not to meddle in your affairs.\" I chuckled a little when I saw her shocked expression. </p><p> \"How-\" </p><p> \"How do I know this? It\'s simple, our connection told me.\" I spoke while laughing. </p><p> \"But that\'s not the way the connection works! It was just supposed to share the couple\'s location like a GPS!\" She practically screamed. </p><p> \"Mine works different,\" I said laughing. </p><p> \"You-\" </p><p> \"I know I\'m not normal, but Violet knew that from the beginning, right?\" I said with the same smile. </p><p> Sasha pouted, \"Stop, please stop interrupting me.\" She looked so adorable now. </p><p> \"Impossible\" I replied. </p><p> \"Wha-\" </p><p> \"Your troubled expression is too beautiful for me to stop doing that.\" </p><p> \"...\" Sasha turned her face away and tried to hide her embarrassed expression. </p><p> I stroke her head, but suddenly, I get up off the floor while holding her like a princess then I carry her to the bed and leave her there. </p><p> \"Natalia,\" I called the blonde maid. </p><p> \"Yes, Lord Victor?\" Natalia appears from a secret passage. </p><p> \"Make Sasha\'s accommodations, she\'ll live with us from now on.\" </p><p> \"Impossible, we don\'t have enough space-\" Natalia was going to continue, but I interrupted, I wanted Sasha around; someone has to keep an eye on her, or she\'ll screw up. </p><p> \"The male vampires who are Violet\'s servants are supposed to stay in her mansion, or around my house. As long as Sasha lives with us, I only want the female vampires around her… Hmm, I remember there is a building for sale a block away… Use Violet\'s money and buy that building.\" </p><p> I don\'t want men living just a room away from Sasha, what if she\'s changing clothes and some of them see? Well, I know she\'ll probably kill them, and so would I... But it\'s better to avoid casualties. </p><p> I sigh a little internally; I don\'t like to use my wife Violet\'s money. After all, that money isn\'t mine, but that\'s just my pride talking. (I think I should start the plan I had before; I need to make money. I\'ll start stealing but, in the future, I\'ll make my money legally within the government\'s laws, after all, money makes money; I just have to use it smartly.) </p><p> In some situations pride is useless... </p><p> I can easily ignore my pride if I can resolve a situation for my wives; if my pride is holding me back, I just have to throw my pride away. </p><p> My pride is worthless if it means my wife\'s well-being. </p><p> I just don\'t ignore my pride when the situation is something like Luan, he\'s my enemy. If he is my enemy, I must fight him! </p><p> I don\'t throw this pride away! And I also don\'t let anyone step on my pride. </p><p> My enemy is mine alone! I want to see his expression of despair, I want to see him slowly breaking down as I step on them~... This pride I don\'t give up. </p><p> \"That\'s possible… The building is much cheaper than the defenses made by the witch June.\" Natalia spoke with a slightly surprised expression. </p><p> Hearing Natalia\'s words, I wake up from my stupor. I can\'t help but sigh internally; I lose control of my emotions too easily, is it because I\'m still evolving? Normally, I don\'t let this sadistic side of me go; I stop thinking about bullshit and I say: </p><p> \"Let Violet know that Sasha is moving in with us. I will also need to talk with my wife, she will be very angry, tell her to meet me.\" </p><p> \"I think she won\'t do that,\" Natalia spoke with uncertainty. </p><p> \"Oh, she will,\" I say with a small smile, then continue as I walk towards the exit of the room: \"My wife is a jealous woman, and obsessed with me. She always puts my safety first and forgets of her own safety, she has the best qualities of a woman.\" </p><p> Soon I continued: \"She is also a loving person, she is a kind woman, and she is very fond of Sasha who is her childhood friend; but her jealousy and obsession for me cloud her judgment\" </p><p> \"Lord Victor, I thought you didn\'t know about Lady Violet\'s personality,\" Natalia spoke a little surprised. </p><p> \"Oh, I know her personality after all... She has the same personality as me.\" I commented with a small smile that Natalia couldn\'t see. </p><p> When Victor left the room, Sasha looked at Natalia and asked, \"What happened?\" </p><p> \"Lord Victor is taking care of you,\" Natalia spoke in a neutral tone with a stoic expression, and she also thought internally: </p><p> \'Upon contacting Sasha, Lord Victor let his real personality show a little. This took much longer than expected. Normally newborns show their true selves the moment they turn into vampires; I think Victor has great self-control and I\'m a little curious what he\'s going to become when he can\'t hold back. </p><p> \"Is he taking care of me...?\" Sasha spoke with a strange expression, but soon after, she flashes a big, distorted smile. \"I see, he\'s taken care of me.\" She put both hands on her face to hide her expression like a teenager in love and started laughing in a low voice, she lays down on the bed and hides her face in the pillow. </p><p> \"...\" Natalia just looked at Sasha with a stoic expression, it was like she was used to seeing this kind of demonstration before. \'Her too, huh? Lady Violet\'s friends are very similar to her…\' </p><p> ......</p>'),(179,8,'Chapter 20 - Childhood Friends',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p> As I was walking towards the vet to pick up my beloved cat Zack, I was thinking about what happened a few minutes ago... I was still a little in shock to find that I have two more wives, but for some reason. .. I\'m very happy, I mean... What man wouldn\'t want to have a harem? </p><p> Violet is interesting, I love her personality and she is very affectionate with me. And, even though I\'ve just met Sasha now, I feel she was really cute and I really like seeing the way she changes when she gets embarrassed. </p><p> And Ruby... I haven\'t contacted her yet to get an opinion on her, but seeing her personality from the memories I got from Sasha, I think she must also have an interesting personality too. </p><p> I also know that having three wives with exotic personalities can be a very stressful thing, after all, I\'m pretty sure problems will arise over time, although I don\'t mind those problems... </p><p> I think about how sad Sasha looked and can\'t help but clench my fist tightly. Seeing Sasha like that made me so angry, and at the same time baffled at myself; I only met her a few minutes ago and started liking her? That\'s impossible. But, when I remember the taste of her blood and the memories I got from drinking her blood, I can\'t help but feel close to her. </p><p> I remember the same thing happening with Violet. The moment I drank Violet\'s blood, I understood who \'Violet\' was; it\'s a very difficult thing to explain that feeling, but I think vampire relationships work differently than humans. They are more aggressive with what they like and don\'t mind kidnapping the person they love to make them love them too... Although this is a very questionable attitude... </p><p> But one thing I was sure of is that Violet, Sasha, Ruby, and I were connected by blood, and I mean it in the most literal sense possible. I thought about that moment when I could feel everything Sasha was feeling, I also knew her superficial thoughts for a moment. </p><p> Sasha and Violet told me how the ritual of turning someone into a vampire worked, and from the memories I absorbed of Sasha and Violet, I can tell that something went wrong with the ritual. </p><p> Violet said that my blood is special... RH Null Blood; the blood that caused me so much trouble and ironically gave me so many benefits when I became a vampire. I could be wrong, but I think my blood influenced the ritual somehow because, except for my blood, I\'m not a special human, I\'m just an ordinary human that can be found everywhere... Because of that thought, I decided that I need to learn more about the very ritual that made me what I am today, and only two beings know a lot about this ritual... The older vampires, and the witches... </p><p> Witches seem to be impossible to learn from about this, I\'m sure with her greedy attitude they will ask me for something valuable, so I think I\'ll have to ask the older vampires. </p><p> \"Sup, Victor.\" I hear a voice talking to me, but I ignore it and keep walking while in deep thoughts. </p><p> I was slowly getting used to people looking at me and whispering things like; Hey, isn\'t his skin too pale? Is he a foreigner? He is very handsome, his blue eyes are beautiful. </p><p> I\'ll be honest, these compliments boost my ego a little, after all, I\'ve never received those compliments from other people, and getting those compliments from your mother isn\'t very trustworthy since, for the mother, the child is beautiful no matter what look is he born with ... Although I felt good when my mother praised me, after all, she is very honest; if she thinks I\'m beautiful, she\'ll say I\'m beautiful, but if she thinks I am I\'m ugly, she\'ll say I\'m ugly as honestly as ever. </p><p> Sometimes in the past, I received damage from my mom\'s honest words; I remember the day I wore a short green shirt and colorful pants and asked my mom if I looked good, and as always she was honest in saying; You look like a clown who went to the circus to work and only wore the pants that were part of the uniform... </p><p> Ugh, just remembering that I still suffer damage... </p><p> \"VICTOR!!\" I heard someone screaming really loud in my ear and, with my new vampire senses, it was like someone had put a speaker on full volume near my ear and had screamed my name. </p><p> I quickly put a hand to my ear and look at whoever did it angrily. </p><p> Seeing that the man who did this to me was my childhood friend, I practically screamed. \"You fucking idiot! Why did you do that!?\" </p><p> \"Bruh, I\'ve been calling you since like 10 minutes ago and you weren\'t talking to me! Are you ignoring me!?\" He asked with his usual gentle smile. </p><p> A man with spiky blond hair and eyes like a green sapphire, he had an asymmetrical V-shaped face with a gentle smile and a body toned from sports, he was tall at 185 cm in height. </p><p> He was my childhood friend Andrew Walter. It\'s been a while since I\'ve seen this idiot; wasn\'t he traveling with his mother or something? Thinking about the appearance of Andrew\'s mother, I can\'t help but shake my head several times to get the thought out of my head. </p><p> Don\'t think of your friend\'s mother that way! Don\'t break the brothers\' code of conduct! </p><p> The brothers\' code of conduct was something my friends and I created and the code was simple: don\'t date your friend\'s ex-girlfriends, don\'t date your friend\'s mother or sister, and most importantly don\'t date your friend\'s current girlfriend. </p><p> Why did we create this? Well, I\'m fully aware that my mom is beautiful; I know that with her personality it\'s almost impossible for her to cheat on my dad, but it\'s good to guarantee, right? Andrew\'s mother is also a very beautiful woman, and my other friend Edward\'s sister was very beautiful too; so to prevent our friendship from falling apart because of reasons like dating a friend\'s mother or sister, we made this code. </p><p> He starts looking at me with questioning eyes, he looks me up and down as if he\'s sizing me up, then he nods to himself as if he understands what happened. \"Did you take any kind of medicine those athletes use? Hmm... What\'s the name again?\" He puts a hand to his chin as if he\'s thinking. </p><p> \"Anabolics?\" I spoke while looking at him. </p><p> \"Yes! That\'s right! Did you take that? Dude, don\'t do this, I know you were bothered with your body but those meds only make your health worse! I\'ll tell your mother!\" He said with that last part sounding like a child who caught his friend doing something wrong and said he was going to tell their mother. </p><p> \"I didn\'t take those!\" I practically screamed. </p><p> \"…It\'s okay, you can be honest with your friend.\" He spoke as he touched my shoulder with a look that would understand me. </p><p> This man really makes me angry sometimes, \"I didn\'t take anything, this is just puberty.\" I used the same excuse I used for my mom. </p><p> He looked at me like I was an idiot and said, \"Bullshit.\" </p><p> Of course, he wouldn\'t believe it... I also know this excuse is ridiculous. </p><p> \"Puberty doesn\'t make a human grow taller, build toned muscle, and make you look the same as Captain America!\" </p><p> ... Well, he\'s right. </p><p> \"If puberty did that, the world would be full of people with superhuman physiques! Stop the bullshit and tell me the truth!\" </p><p> Ugh... I think of an excuse to change the subject, soon something comes to mind, \"I have a wife now.\" </p><p> He looks at me with a shocked face, \"I don\'t believe you.\" He spoke in a dry, honest tone. </p><p> I just looked at him with a dead stare, he knows I\'m like my mother and I\'m very honest with close people; living 21 years with a mother who speaks all she thinks can influence you in some way. </p><p> \"…It\'s a lie, right? Right!?\" He looked at me with eyes begging that it was a lie. </p><p> \"Dude, I\'m married now,\" I said honestly. </p><p> \"... I do not believe it! After all, you\'re not wearing a wedding ring! What kind of man marries and doesn\'t wear a wedding ring? Are you already cheating on your wife!?\" </p><p> Bruh. Decide whether you believe me or not... Sigh, what a troubled man. </p><p> \"It\'s true, I\'m married, but things happened too quickly and I couldn\'t prepare a wedding ring or anything. Anyway, seeya!\" I said goodbye to him. </p><p> \"Huh!? Wait! I\'ll go with you!\" </p><p> I stopped walking and looked at him, \"You don\'t even know where I\'m going and you\'re going to follow me? What if I\'m going somewhere illegal?\" </p><p> \"That matters? If you\'re going somewhere illegal, I\'ll go with you; it must be fun there, right? I can\'t let you go alone in this place, of course when this is all over, I\'ll tell your mother.\" </p><p> \"....\" This man is a good friend, but for some reason, he\'s always ratting on me to my mother... Wait... </p><p> I look at him dead-eyed, \"If you chase after my mom, I\'ll go after your mom too! Are you listening to me!?\" I threatened him. </p><p> He looks at me with a look like he doesn\'t believe what I said, \"Dude, you know I respect your mother a lot, after all, she helped me with a problem in the past involving my father and I remember the code. I wouldn\'t do something like that.\" </p><p> \"Good,\" I think I\'m satisfied, I know he wouldn\'t do that and I also know he respects my mother a lot since she was their family advocate when his worthless father wanted custody of Andrew. </p><p> \"And I don\'t like married women either, they are troublesome, and I don\'t want to die from a stray bullet by a man I put a green hat on.\" He spoke with a gentle smile. </p><p> \"You speak as if you have experience of your own…\" I looked at him suspiciously. </p><p> I saw his smile break for a moment, then he said, \"I use my right to remain silent, we are in a free country!\" </p><p> \"… Dude, you\'re going to die one of these days, you better stop it.\" I gave a piece of advice. </p><p> \"I know, I did this when I was 20 years old, I stopped doing this after what happened in the past.\" </p><p> \'You are only 21 years old! Don\'t talk like this is in the distant past!\' I commented internally. </p><p> \"Oh, well... Was she pretty?\" I couldn\'t help but ask curious as I started walking towards the vet, I also noticed he started following me. </p><p> \"Yes, she was 32 years old, curvy body with dark black hair; she lived in New York and she was from a wealthy family, but her husband was a 66-year-old man, I think she was frustrated because her husband didn\'t satisfy her.\" </p><p> \"Oh, the pattern, huh? </p><p> \"Indeed,\" He spoke. </p><p> \"…Somehow, I feel sorry for the guy,\" I commented a little sympathetically. </p><p> \"Oh? Own experience? Dude, you just got married and you\'re already taking your wife\'s greenhorn!?\" </p><p> \"Fuck off!\" </p><p> He laughed out loud, I had a small smile too, even though he\'s an annoying friend at times, he was a good friend; I\'ve known him since I was a kid too. </p><p> \"Well, I know with your personality, you would probably kill the guy and your wife if you found out you were being cheated on.\" He commented casually like it was no big deal. </p><p> \"Hey, if that happens I won\'t stop it, but I won\'t let you kill yourself. After all, you\'re my friend, I think I should make a plan in case this happens in the future, maybe save money and buy a passport abroad? Maybe Brazil? I heard the politicians there are very corrupt, and in exchange for a few dollars, they would help you easily.\" He began to monologue out loud. </p><p> \"Stop thinking nonsense, that will never happen,\" I said, after all, knowing Violet\'s personality, it\'s impossible for that to happen. </p><p> \"Okay, but I\'ll still make the plan.\" </p><p> \"Alright.\" I accepted, I know it\'s no use talking anymore now; he\'s always like that. He\'s very careful, I think what happened in the past with his father affected him a lot. </p><p> ... </p><p> Looking at a small establishment in front of me, I nod to myself, this is the right place. </p><p> When I entered the establishment the first thing I saw was my cat, Zack, sitting at the counter and looking around in surveillance. </p><p> I looked at my cat, he is furry black with a patch of fur around his chest and neck that is pinkish-white in color; his head fur was also very spiky and he has short ears with less black and more dark brown fur. On the outside, his eyes were pool blue and had a black slit in the middle, typical of cats, but my cat\'s eyes were the cutest of all, cough, okay, maybe not. But I think so, so it\'s true. He had a cat\'s whiskers, of course, nearly ten strands of white on each side. </p><p> \"Sup, Zack. How are you?\" I spoke out loud, the few customers who were picking up their pets looked at me with confused eyes, probably thinking I was crazy or something, but soon something happens that surprises everyone. </p><p> Zack looks at me and raises his paw, \"Meow.\" </p><p> Umu, I nod at myself satisfied, and I smiled a little when I saw the customers look at the shocked cat. </p><p> \"As always, your cat looks more like a dog than a cat; I don\'t like cats, but I wouldn\'t mind adopting him.\" </p><p> \"Never! And cats are the best, they are silent, quiet, and affectionate making them the best animal there is!\" </p><p> \"Meow!\" Zack meowed at me like he was agreeing. </p><p> \"See? Even he agrees!\" </p><p> \"Whatever,\" Andrew doesn\'t even try to argue, so he turns his face and looks at a 21-year-old woman who was wearing a doctor\'s coat. </p><p> \"Oh, Victor, and…Andrew.\" She spoke Andrew\'s name angrily. </p><p> ...</p>'),(180,8,'Chapter 21 - Andrew Edward And Leona',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p> I look at the woman who is my friend\'s sister. </p><p> She has pure white hair, bright blue eyes, and a slim body with skin like she\'s lacking blood; she\'s not pale like me, she\'s more like an albino. And, she was born with this physical condition too, she was also tall at 180 cm. </p><p> As she has no skin pigmentation her skin is very sensitive to the sun and, because of that, she rarely leaves the store or her house and only goes out at night. </p><p> Her name was Leona Elizabeth Lykos. </p><p> Normally, I would suspect she would be a vampire, but she isn\'t, I know that because I\'ve seen her eat regular food and I know vampires can\'t eat foods other than blood. </p><p> Even though Violet sometimes forgets about it and asks to learn how to cook with my mom, I think she was just excited? </p><p> I walk over to my cat and start petting him, and as usual, he starts to purr contentedly, and then he lies down on the counter and spreads his legs as if asking me to stroke his stomach. </p><p> Leona approaches me and I also see Andrew walking away and sitting in the chair away from the counter, he seemed to be waiting for me. I think he doesn\'t want to talk to Leona? </p><p> Well, I don\'t judge him, what he did in the past must have hurt Leona, because of that, he\'s just being considerate. </p><p> \"Why is your cat just like that to you? When I try to caress him, he starts growling at me.\" Leona spoke with a pout as she stopped and looked at me like she was sizing me up, I feel her looking me up and down. </p><p> \"Well, he is my cat?\" I spoke. </p><p> \"Meow!\" Zack meowed in agreement. </p><p> \"You\'ve changed...\" Leona spoke as she looked at me... </p><p> \"Yes, you too,\" I said honestly. After all, I noticed her skin was better than in the past, I think living in isolation helped her? </p><p> \"...\" Leona remains silent, and I see her continue to stare at me. </p><p> I look at her confused; I know I\'ve changed, but does she need to stare at me like she\'s seeing a rare animal? </p><p> \"Hmm, how is Zack\'s health?\" </p><p> Suddenly, she stopped staring at me and looked at Zack, \"He\'s fine.\" </p><p> \"Really? But he was meowing a lot earlier.\" I remember I couldn\'t sleep because he kept meowing like he was dying or something. </p><p> \"...well, he was horny\" </p><p> \"...Huh?\" I looked at Zack, seeing the chubby fluffy cat staring at me with a satisfied look, I found it so cute that I started stroking more. \"You mean he was in heat?\" </p><p> \"Meow, Meow!\" He purred contentedly. </p><p> \"Yes. Because of that, he was meowing a lot, wouldn\'t you consider neutering him? Since you are my childhood friend, I\'ll give you a good price.\" </p><p> Zack suddenly gets up from the counter and looks at Leona with a Glare like he\'s looking at his greatest enemy, he\'s even growling a little. </p><p> \"He didn\'t like that idea very much.\" I chuckled as I looked at Leona who was looking at Zack in shock. </p><p> \"He\'s very smart.\" She praised him. </p><p> \"Yes,\" I said nodding my head, then I answer her question, \"I won\'t castrate him, after all, as a man, I understand Zack; he still wants to have kids, right? Buddy?\" </p><p> \"Meow.\" Zack meowed as if he was agreeing, then he jumps on my shirt and slowly climbs up my shirt, over my shoulder, then he hangs on my shoulder; this is something he did a lot when he was younger. After all, I\'ve raised him since he was very young, and he always liked to be on my shoulder for some reason. </p><p> As my shoulder was wider than before, he could easily find a comfortable position. </p><p> \"Isn\'t he acting like a monkey?\" Leona spoke a little surprised. </p><p> Zack looked at Leona and started growling at her, he really didn\'t like her, huh? </p><p> \"Ugh, I feel offended; all animals like me and, because of this gift, I created this store. But, why doesn\'t he like me?! He\'s so cute, I wanted to hug him!\" She spoke with a pout. </p><p> I just laugh a little, and I found Leona\'s expression cute, when I was going to say something, I heard: </p><p> \"Oh? Victor, long time no see.\" I look at the store entrance. </p><p> And soon I see a tall man walking in, he is 195 cm tall, with a toned body, platinum blond hair, and blue eyes like Leona; he was Leona\'s brother. </p><p> Edward Jonathan Lykos, he was also my former personal trainer. In the past, he worked as a fitness trainer, but he suddenly decided to change jobs and now he owns a bar. </p><p> He is also the man who trained me in martial arts in the past, although I couldn\'t learn much because of my physical limitation, I just learned how to defend myself. Techniques like kicking a man\'s most precious organ, using a stun gun. .. Come to think of it, this was training for frail women, huh? </p><p> \"Sup, Ed, do you still shine in the sun when you walk down the street?\" </p><p> \"Ugh. Can you forget about this boring joke? Because of that vampire movie, every Edward on the planet is now suffering from that joke.\" He spoke in annoyance. </p><p> I laughed a little and said, \"I\'m kidding, how are things going?\" </p><p> \"It\'s ok, I\'ve finished building my bar\'s leisure area, you can go there if you want, remember I only open at night.\" He spoke as he closed the door and walked towards the counter. </p><p> \"I see, I will visit sometime.\" </p><p> \"Brother, did you finish the order I requested?\" Leona asked. </p><p> \"Yes, that was an easy thing.\" </p><p> \"Good,\" Leona nods satisfied, and goes to meet a customer who has entered the store. </p><p> I see Andrew approaching, and then he says, \"Yo, Ed. How are you doing?\" </p><p> \"I\'m fine,\" Edward looks at Andrew, \"Is my sister still mad at you?\" </p><p> \"Yes...Honestly, I didn\'t know that woman was her only friend, if I knew I wouldn\'t have approached her.\" Andrew spoke with an apologetic face. </p><p> In the past, Leona was bullied because of her looks and as she always hung around with Andrew, who was a cute boy, and my other friend Fred, she ended up earning free hate from the girls at school. </p><p> She also hung around with me in the past, but I was pretty much a non-existent being to the girls at school. After all, I was thin and I looked really sick, I think I got along with Leona because of these similarities. </p><p> Fortunately, her brother never let the bullying escalate, since he was a veteran at the time, and he protected his sister tooth and nail. He even beat up a student who hurt his sister... How can I say, I respect him a lot; he doesn\'t care if they\'re a woman or a man, his fists have true gender equality... </p><p> Although this incident was a big problem in the past, he almost got arrested, luckily he had the support of my mother who was a renowned lawyer; if not for my mother, and his father who was a teacher at the school in the past, he would be behind bars now. </p><p> A good side of this story is that bullying stopped happening, after all, the girls were afraid of Edward. </p><p> But it\'s not all flowers, because of this incident, Leona couldn\'t make friends near the area where she lived, and the only friend she had used to date Andrew. </p><p> And Andrew cheated on Leona\'s friend with an older woman... </p><p> Because of that, Leona is angry with Andrew. </p><p> \"You don\'t need to worry too much, one day she will forgive you, you are good friends after all,\" Edward spoke with a gentle smile. </p><p> \"Ugh, stop lying, I know her as well as you do, I know she\'s spiteful,\" Andrew said. </p><p> \"Indeed.\" Edward nodded his head in agreement. </p><p> \"Meow.\" Zack meowed in agreement as well. </p><p> Edward looks at Zack for a while, then he looks at me. \"Hmm, have you grown up?\" </p><p> \"You just now that noticed, brother?\" Leona who finished serving the customer said, now that there were no customers in the store, she could participate in the conversation more actively. </p><p> \"Ugh, how am I going to figure that out? He was always the shortest of the group.\" </p><p> \"Oof,\" I made a gesture like I was being pierced by an arrow through the heart. </p><p> \"Brother, you don\'t have to be rude!\" </p><p> \"It\'s okay, I also know that I was short, I was even shorter than Leona...\" I commented a little depressed. </p><p> \"Hmm, your muscles are defined too, how did you get that muscle?\" He asked curiously. </p><p> \"Well, I followed the training you went through and some videos on the internet.\" The lies are getting more absurd as time goes by, it\'s pretty obvious they\'re suspicious, they just don\'t ask too much because they respect my privacy. </p><p> \"Oh, you\'re not on steroids, are you?\" </p><p> \"Of course not, I know what it does to the body,\" I replied. </p><p> I take Zack off my shoulder and place him on the counter, then stop stroking him. Zack meowed at me annoyed, but I ignored him, he seemed to snort for a few seconds and then started walking around the establishment. </p><p> \"Hmm\" Suddenly, Edward puts his hand on his chin and looks at me: </p><p> \"Are you still being bullied?\" He asked in a neutral tone. </p><p> Leona and Andrew look at me, Leona looked worried, and Andrew looked angry. </p><p> \"I\'m not being bullied anymore, I resolved that situation yesterday,\" I spoke with a big smile on my face. </p><p> I saw Leona\'s body shake a little, and Andrew just kept looking at me. </p><p> \"I heard, you dealt with him using a basketball game,\" Edward said. </p><p> \"I heard you jumped from the middle of the court and made a dunk.\" He continued as he looked at me with suspicious eyes. </p><p> \"...\" I remained silent, after all, I wasn\'t making an effort to hide the changes in my body, I didn\'t want to hide them either. </p><p> \"Well, no need to feel pressured, we all have secrets we want to hide, I\'m just upset you didn\'t want us to get involved in this situation,\" Edward spoke with a gentle smile. </p><p> \"Yes! I wanted to hit that bastard!\" Andrew spoke. </p><p> \"Yes, bullying is unforgivable,\" Leona said. </p><p> I look at Andrew, \"I appreciate you guys caring about me, but you know me, right?\" </p><p> I looked at my friends with a big smile on my face: \"Luan is mine! Just mine! I will not allow anyone to get involved in this, he is someone who hurt me and insulted my mother; this grudge can only be washed away by me, this is my pride!\" Only I\'m allowed to step on and break Luan, I won\'t be satisfied otherwise. </p><p> My friends may call me a fool, or an idiot, but I don\'t care; I will not allow my enemies to be destroyed by anyone other than me! </p><p> \"Sigh, I understand you, you have your pride as a man and I respect that but don\'t go overboard, okay? I don\'t want to see you arrested,\" Edward said and advised me. </p><p> \"Indeed, if you are arrested, please know that I have a plan for you to flee to Brazil, although that plan is still in progress,\" Andrew spoke. </p><p> \"You are fools! Why don\'t you just help him!?\" Leona practically screamed out loud. </p><p> Andrew and Edward looked at Leona. </p><p> Edward said, \"He didn\'t ask for help, and I respect his pride, as a man, I can understand his feelings.\" </p><p> Andrew said, \"Victor is my friend, and he knows his limits, if he needs help, he knows he can count on us; if he didn\'t ask for help, I won\'t interfere.\" </p><p> \"...You guys are just idiots!\" Leona snorted. </p><p> \"You wouldn\'t understand,\" Edward said and Andrew nodded. </p><p> \"Yes, Yes. I don\'t understand because I\'m a woman, right?\" Leona spoke irritably. </p><p> \"Wrong, you don\'t understand why because you never tried to fight people who bullied you,\" Edward spoke in a hard tone. </p><p> \"I was weaker, and they-\" Leona tried to say something, but Edward cut her off: </p><p> \"You know I\'m not talking about that... There is a big difference between accepting bullying and fighting it. The attitude of how you deal with bullying is what matters, you never decided to ask for help, and you never talked about it! You just put up with everything silently!\" Edward spoke raising his voice a little. </p><p> \"...\" Leona looked shocked at her brother. </p><p> He sighs and says, \"Unlike you, Victor never accepted bullying and warned us what was happening to him, and he told us that he was going to solve it somehow.\" </p><p> \"Indeed,\" Andrew continues ignoring Leona\'s gaze: \"Although we trusted Victor, we were always on the lookout for something to get out of hand, we respected Victor\'s pride and decision, but that doesn\'t mean we stood still while our friend was beaten,\" He said smiling, it seems they did something I didn\'t know. </p><p> I really have good friends... I thought with a happy smile on my face, seeing Leona\'s sad look I say, \"Don\'t think about it too much, Leona.\" </p><p> \"Huh?\" </p><p> \"Everyone handles a situation differently, I\'m different from you, and you\'re different from your brother. You don\'t need to push yourself so hard.\" </p><p> I approach Leona and patted her head a little: \"You just need to do things your way, okay? And if you need help with something, you can count on me, your brother, Andrew, and Fred.\" </p><p> \"Mm,\" Leona lowers her head, and I see her face turn a little red. As her skin was very white, her embarrassment became quite noticeable... Fuck, I wasn\'t supposed to do this, I need to control this hand of mine; I have become very used to stroking women\'s heads. </p><p> I look at Edward and see his bloodthirsty look, he was warning me of the code! I quickly pull away from Leona, for a moment I see her pouting as she glares at her brother in annoyance. </p><p> \"Hahaha, Victor was always good with words,\" Andrew chuckled, then he continued, \"Oh I hear he\'s married.\" </p><p> \"...Huh?\" Leona and Edward looked at me in shock. </p><p> ..........</p>'),(181,8,'Chapter 22 - Yanderes Means Problems',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p> \"…huh? You\'re married, Victor?\" Edward spoke as he looked at me with a shocked face. </p><p> \"Yes,\" I answered honestly. </p><p> Edward\'s gaze shifted to a look as if I\'d made the biggest mistake of my life… </p><p> \"Marriage is not a good thing, Victor... But if you\'re happy, I\'m supportive.\" He spoke while shaking a little, he seemed to remember bad things from the past. </p><p> \"Pfft,\" Andrew started to laugh. </p><p> I looked at Andrew who was laughing, \"Stop laughing! And why did he react that way?\" I asked. </p><p> He held back his laugh and said, \"Oh, you didn\'t know, right? A few years ago, Andrew tried to marry a woman, but she was the jealous and stalking type and, because of that, he has emotional scars from what happened.\" </p><p> I see Edward shiver a little when he hears Andrew talk about what happened. </p><p> \"But aren\'t they the best women?\" I replied without understanding. </p><p> \"Huh?\" </p><p> \"Huh?\" </p><p> \"Meow?\" Even Zack, who was a little distant, meowed aloud. </p><p> I looked confused at Andrew and Edward who were looking at me as if they had seen an exotic creature. </p><p> Edward puts his hand to his face like he has a headache, and asks me, \"Do you have a head problem?\" </p><p> \"Huh?\" Now I was the one who didn\'t understand. </p><p> \"From the expression, he\'s making it\'s obvious that he really doesn\'t understand his problem,\" Andrew spoke as Edward nodded. </p><p> Then Edward speaks, \"Listen, Victor. Jealous and stalking women are the worst kind of women. Don\'t go near them, or you\'ll get killed!\" </p><p> \"I don\'t understand what you\'re saying, if you accept her feelings won\'t everything be okay? Why should I care?\" I asked really confused. </p><p> \"....\" </p><p> They were silently looking at me with their mouths open in shock. </p><p> \"He\'s a lost cause… Come to think of it, he\'s always been like that, huh? He always picked the craziest women.\" Andrew spoke as if thinking of the past. </p><p> \"Coming to think of it... That\'s true,\" Edward said, then he continued, \"Has he never heard that he should never date a crazy woman?\" </p><p> \"Wait!\" Leona suddenly screamed as she looked at Edward and Andrew. </p><p> \"Are you just going to ignore that he just said he got married!?\" she spoke as she knocked on the table. </p><p> \"Oh, that\'s true,\" Edward said. </p><p> \"Who is your wife? Do you have a picture of her?\" Andrew asked and, hearing Andrew\'s question, Leona and Edward looked at me. </p><p> \"Hmm, I do,\" Actually, I had pictures of Violet and Sasha. I didn\'t take these pictures, it seems like Natalia was making a photo album or something, so, she took some pictures and sent me to my phone. </p><p> I never understood this maid, she always seems to be hidden, but when I call her she always appears; she is like a ghost... </p><p> I pull out my cell phone and show Violet\'s photo. </p><p> Andrew whistled: \"She\'s hot-\" </p><p> I looked at Andrew with an emotionless expression. \"Keep talking... And I promise you tomorrow you\'ll wake up in New York Bay, I bet the fish will love to eat you.\" </p><p> I saw Andrew\'s body shake a little, he replied. \"It\'s just a joke, and you wouldn\'t do it, right?\" </p><p> I keep looking at him with an emotionless gaze. </p><p> \"Right?\" I saw Andrew\'s expression darken a little in fear. </p><p> \"You know I always keep my promises,\" I said in a dry tone. To be honest, I wouldn\'t do that, he\'s a good friend and I wouldn\'t kill my friend just for that; but he would get hit a little. </p><p> Edward touched Andrew\'s shoulder and said, \"Remember the Brothers code.\" </p><p> \"Yes, I know,\" Andrew said in a serious tone. </p><p> \"Victor wouldn\'t dump you in New York Bay, but he would probably hit you, and I think he\'s more capable of defending himself with his current body,\" Edward continued. </p><p> Suddenly, Leona appears in front of me and takes my cell phone, I look at her confused, then she flips the image to the side and sees Sasha\'s photo. </p><p> \"Who is she?\" She asked in a neutral tone. </p><p> \"Oh, she\'s my second wife.\" </p><p> \"...\" </p><p> My three friends look at me with the most shocked face I\'ve ever seen in my life, if this was an anime I bet their mouths would be on the ground by now. </p><p> \"Hold the balls of the donkey!\" Andrew practically yelled, he approaches Leona and looks at the image of Sasha on the phone. </p><p> I see Leona\'s eyebrow twitch a little in annoyance, but she\'s silent. </p><p> I see Edward approaching, and he also sees Sasha\'s photo. </p><p> \"Hmm, I don\'t know how to react to that, when did you become a chad?\" Edward spoke in a tired tone. </p><p> I see my cat climbing on Edward\'s shoulder and looking at Sasha\'s picture, then he looks at me and meows as he raises his paw: \"Meow.\" </p><p> He seemed to be praising me or something. </p><p> \"W-Wait,\" Leona looked quite shaken, she looks at me and asks, \"Do they know about each other!?\" </p><p> \"Yes, of course,\" I replied. </p><p> \"...\" </p><p> \"Damn, Victor... You made quite a catch, I never thought I would say that, but I\'m proud of you.\" Edward spoke as he held back the tears from his eyes; somehow I could tell he was jealous, but at the same time, he was scared. </p><p> \"Ed, you don\'t understand! You know our friend here, right? Do you think he\'s a man to chase after another woman if he\'s married!? He\'s not me!\" Andrew practically screamed. </p><p> Bruh, you mustn\'t say that about yourself with pride. </p><p> \"Coming to think about it, you\'re right,\" Edward said. </p><p> \"Yes, Victor is a very loyal man,\" Leona said and the three looked at me. </p><p> \"Well, to be honest, they\'re the ones who came after me,\" I replied with a happy little smile. </p><p> \"...\" </p><p> The three of them look at me with dead fish eyes, Leona said, \"You know you can\'t marry more than one person in this country, right?\" </p><p> \"I know.\" I nod my head in agreement, but human law means nothing to vampires. </p><p> \"Question.\" Andrew raised his hand like he was a child who wanted to ask the teacher a question. </p><p> \"What?\" </p><p> \"Do your wives get angry when other women approach you? Do they suddenly have tantrums? Are they very jealous?\" </p><p> I look at Andrew shocked, \"How did you know that?\" </p><p> \"Bruh,\" Andrew replied, he looked at Edward and Leona, \"Now everything makes sense.\" </p><p> Edward nodded and he looks at me with a dead fish look, \"RIP, Buddy... I think soon, we\'ll be going to your funeral.\" </p><p> \"Huh!?\" </p><p> \"Brother, don\'t gamble on Victor!\" Leona spoke irritated, then she continued, \"What if he really dies!?\" </p><p> \"Why are you thinking I\'m going to die?\" I asked as soon all my friends looked at me in shock even my cat looked at me. </p><p> \"You\'re dating two Yanderes, buddy…\" Andrew said. </p><p> \"Yandere?\" I questioned the word I didn\'t know. </p><p> \"Do you remember that pink-haired girl anime that we watched in our teens?\" </p><p> \"Oh, I remember I thought she was pretty at the time, what about her?\" I asked. </p><p> I saw Edward, Leona, and Andrew\'s faces tremble as they heard my words. </p><p> \"She is a yandere.\" </p><p> \"I see... And you\'re saying my wives are just like her?\" </p><p> \"Yes.\" </p><p> \"Isn\'t that a good thing?\" I blurted out, after all, I don\'t know what the word \'yandere\' means, but Violet and Sasha are adorable, and that\'s all that matters. </p><p> \"....\" </p><p> Sigh! Sigh! Sigh! </p><p> The three sighed at the same time, and it looks like they\'ve given up on something. </p><p> \"Just don\'t die, okay? And don\'t cheat on your wives, or you\'ll die\" </p><p> \"I would never do that, why should I cheat on my wives if I have such beautiful wives?\" </p><p> \"Sigh, if you didn\'t have a screw loose in your head, you\'d be a good man.\" Leona sighed. </p><p> Edward looked at his sister with serious eyes. \"I won\'t allow it! Absolutely not! You\'ll never get married while I\'m alive!\" </p><p> \"Brother!\" Leona cried out in embarrassment. </p><p> \"There\'s Edward Siscon,\" Andrew said laughing. </p><p> \"Siscon?\" I asked confused. </p><p> Leona, Andrew, and Edward looked at me as if I had done something wrong. </p><p> Andrew says, \"You\'re an uncultured man, buddy. We need to sort this out.\" </p><p> \"Huh!?\" </p><p> \"Well don\'t judge him too much, he\'s a movie man; I remember his dad likes watching movies, he must have been influenced.\" Leona helped me. </p><p> \"Heretic,\" Edward said. </p><p> \"Coming to think about it, he\'s only watched two animes in his life, huh?\" Andrew spoke. </p><p> \"Unforgivable,\" Edward said. </p><p> \"Hmm, it was the one anime with the alien that gets stronger and his hair changes color, and the pink-haired Yandere\'s anime,\" Leona said. </p><p> \"Yes, I remember you recommended it to him at the time,\" Andrew said. </p><p> \"Indeed.\" Leona nodded. </p><p> Suddenly, my cell phone started ringing, Leona looks at my cell phone and says, \"Kaguya?\" </p><p> \"Oh, she\'s my wife\'s maid.\" </p><p> \"M-Maid...?\" Leona spoke in a stutter. </p><p> I hold out my hand and Leona nods as she hands me the cell. </p><p> I answer my cell phone and start talking to Kaguya. </p><p> While Victor was on the phone talking to Kaguya, his friends were whispering in a not-so-low voice. </p><p> \"Did he just say M-Maid?\" Leona spoke. </p><p> \"Why are you stuttering?\" Andrew asked curiously. </p><p> \"Idiot, hiring a maid is expensive, did you know?\" Leona spoke. </p><p> \"Oh, I didn\'t know,\" Andrew said. </p><p> \"I think his wife is rich,\" Edward deduced. </p><p> \"Isn\'t he very lucky?\" Andrew can\'t help but speak out loud. </p><p> Leona and Edward look at Andrew confused. </p><p> Andrew begins to explain, \"He married two wives, and one of those wives is rich, and both wives are beautiful.\" </p><p> \"Oh, you\'re right, but it\'s not all flowers, they\'re yanderes, you know? He could die at any time,\" Edward explained as he shivered a little. </p><p> \"Hmm, I think Victor will be fine,\" Leona said, now that she was calmer, she could think better about the whole situation. </p><p> \"What do you mean?\" Edward asked. </p><p> \"Remember how Victor\'s personality is, he may not realize it, but he knows how to treat a woman well. I think his mother\'s teachings influenced him without him realizing it and he became a natural playboy.\" Leona would never say that the headpats Victor gave were good too, she would never speak it out loud! Never! </p><p> \"And he doesn\'t refuse Yandere\'s advances, so I think he\'s safe? The protagonists only die in the anime because he refused women\'s advances, after all, most of these protagonists were beta men.\" Leona said. </p><p> \"Hmm, you\'re right,\" Andrew said. </p><p> \"Victor likes crazy women, huh?\" Edward spoke out loud, he looked confused. </p><p> \"Just in case, I\'ll keep in touch with a friend of mine from the police, after all, stalking is a criminal act,\" Andrew said. </p><p> \"Oh, now that I think of it, in real life the act of stalking someone is a crime,\" Leona said. </p><p> \"Leona, you are watching too many animes,\" Edward scolded her lightly. </p><p> \"Brother, I can\'t leave the house because of my skin, what do you think I should do? Look for a boyfriend?\" </p><p> \"Absolutely not! I will buy more animes for you! So stay home!\" </p><p> \"Humpf,\" Leona huffed and turned her face away, but Andrew could see she had a smile as if it was all part of her plan. </p><p> Victor ended his call and said, \"I\'m going home.\" </p><p> I look at Zack and say, \"Hey, Zack. Let\'s go, buddy.\" </p><p> \"Meow,\" Zack who was lying on a chair gets up, walks slowly towards me, and climbs on my shoulder then I put my hand behind to hold him, and he lies down on my shoulder. </p><p> \"…Are you absolutely sure he\'s not a dog? Or a monkey? How can a cat be so smart?\" Leona asked in disbelief, I also see Andrew and Edward nodding. </p><p> \"He\'s normal, he\'s just used to being that way, after all, I\'ve raised him from a young age,\" I replied. </p><p> \"....\" Leona is silent and decides not to argue anymore, she just sighs as if she had given up on something. </p><p> Edward looks at me, \"What happened? You look happy,\" </p><p> \"Oh my wife met my other wife today, because of that I\'m happy,\" I answered honestly. </p><p> My three friends look at me with dark faces and I realize Edward was shaking a little too. </p><p> \"Two Yandere will meet…\" Andrew swallows hard, and sighs as he looks at me with respect, \"How can I say, Victor you are a man among men.\" </p><p> \"Thanks?\" I reply, confused. </p><p> \"Anyway, I\'ll see you guys later.\" I spoke as I turned around </p><p> \"Bye, Victor. Try not to die, Buddy,\" Edward said. </p><p> \"Take care of yourself, Victor,\" Andrew said, he looked like he wasn\'t going to follow me anymore. </p><p> Leona didn\'t say anything, she just waved at me. </p><p> .... </p>'),(182,8,'Chapter 23 - Violet And Sasha Meet',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p> \"Tell me, Zack,\" I said to my cat as I walked towards my house. I noticed people\'s eyes on me; It\'s like think they\'ve never seen a cat in their life. </p><p> Even though my cat doesn\'t speak, I can deduce or imagine what he says, after all, he is a smart cat. </p><p> Currently, Zack was on my shoulder as he looked around curiously. </p><p> \"Meow?\" Zack meowed curiously. </p><p> After living so long with my cat, I was able to differentiate his every meow; his being so smart helps a little too. </p><p> \"Did Leona treat you well?\" I asked as I walked. </p><p> \"Meow! Meow! Meow...!\" Translation: She treated me well, but she bathed me!! I hate that woman! </p><p> \"Oh, I see.

I know you don\'t like to shower, but a shower every week isn\'t too bad, right?\" I spoke with a smile on my face. </p><p> I look over my shoulder and see Zack staring at me with a horrified look; he seems to have heard something scary. </p><p> \"Three baths a month?\" I tried to negotiate. </p><p> \"Meow!\" Translation: one bath a month! </p><p> \"Two baths a month, that\'s not negotiable,\" I said. </p><p> \"Meow!

Didn\'t you fight for dominance?\" I asked while raising an eyebrow. </p><p> \"Meow, Meow, Meow, Meow!\" Translation: Of course I fought, I used that technique called the \'T\' pose that you taught me. Using this technique, I asserted my dominance and now I have four wives! </p><p> \"That\'s my boy!\" I said laughing as I took him off my shoulder and carried him like a baby while stroking his stomach. </p><p> \"Meow~, Meow.\" Translation: Kimochi~... You are very good at this. </p><p> Huh? Why did the first word come out in Japanese? Am I imagining it wrong?

Get back here right now!\" My mom yelled as she looked at Zack who ran up onto the couch. </p><p> \"Meow!\" Translation: Never! </p><p> Ignoring my mom and Zack\'s banter, I walk towards the basement stealthily. When I first enter the basement, I see what my old basement looks like but, when I put my foot on the first step, I see a little magic circle appearing, and soon the basement changes. </p><p> Witch technology is very useful... </p><p> \"Kaguya, what are you doing!? Let me kill that bitch!\" I heard Violet\'s voice. </p><p> \"I\'m sorry, Lady Violet, but I can\'t let you do something you\'ll regret,\" Kaguya spoke in a neutral tone. </p><p> Well, looks like I made it on time. </p><p> I walk towards the room Sasha was in and, when I open the bedroom door, I see a rather surprising scene. </p><p> Kaguya was holding Violet on the ground with a Jiu-jitsu technique called a rear-naked choke, a little far from Kaguya was Natalia who was just watching everything as usual. </p><p> Sasha was watching everything with a neutral gaze. Currently, she was sitting on the bed and beside her was Maria, her personal maid who was a former hunter. </p><p> Violet looked quite startling, her face was distorted with hatred and she was glaring at Sasha with her red eyes gleaming with killing intent. </p><p> I realized Violet was trying to use her powers, but Kaguya was smothering her before she could concentrate on using them. </p><p> As expected from an older vampire, she managed to immobilize Violet easily... I guess it wasn\'t that easy... Looking more closely, I realize that Kaguya is trying very hard to hold Violet down. </p><p> \"Yo,\" I said with a smile on my face. </p><p> Suddenly, all the women in the room look at me. </p><p> My wife Violet\'s killing intent seems to explode when she sees me, \"Victor!\" She didn\'t call me darling as usual. </p><p> I look at Kaguya and nod my head indicating for her to let go of Violet, she looks at me with a face that asked if I was sure; I close my eyes and nod my head as I smile. </p><p> Violet suddenly jumps towards me and I realize she\'s trying to stab me with her hand; since I\'m not ready to feel this pain yet, I take her hand and, as if it\'s a very elegant dance, I shift her center of gravity then quickly sit down on the floor and drop her onto my lap. I also realized she wasn\'t putting that much force into her attack. </p><p> \"Huh...?\" Violet didn\'t understand what happened. </p><p> Well, I seem to still remember the dance lessons I took in the past; this was a long time ago when I attended a multibillion company CEO\'s party, as my mom was the CEO\'s attorney at the time, I had to participate and dance with the CEO\'s daughter. And, because of that, I had to train in classical dance for two months, it was the most irritating time in my teenage life, stopping to think now, that was the same day I found Zack abandoned in the street. </p><p> I hugged Violet around the waist and spoke into her ear, \"Calm down, I\'m not going to disappear or anything, and you\'re not going to lose me, so you don\'t have to attack me out of jealousy.\" </p><p> Violet seemed to melt when she felt my embrace and heard my words, I noticed her eyes revert to their normal violet color. </p><p> \"And to think that there was someone other than Violet\'s mother who could calm her down…\" Natalia commented. </p><p> Hmm? I look at Natalia and I see her with a small smile on her face, I could also see Sasha and Kaguya\'s shocked expressions. </p><p> \"Why are you looking at me like that?\" I asked as I started stroking Violet\'s head. </p><p> \"When Violet goes crazy, she only gets calmer when she destroys everything around her,\" Sasha spoke in a neutral tone. It was like she was used to it, I also noticed that she was looking at Violet with an annoyed look. </p><p> I noticed that Violet\'s smile seemed to grow in a distorted way, and she put her face to my chest and started sniffing at me. </p><p> \"Darling~! Darling~! Darling~! Darling~!\" She started talking like she was possessed by some evil spirit or something, although she looked quite adorable now. </p><p> \"Hmm?\" Suddenly her smile is gone, and she looks at me with a serious look. </p><p> \"Why am I smelling another woman?\" </p><p> \"Oh I went to get Zack from the vet, I found my childhood friend who works at that place,\" I replied while smiling. </p><p> When I saw Violet\'s eyes change to blood red, I cup Violet\'s cheek in both hands and pull. \"Don\'t think nonsense.\" </p><p> \"S-Stop,\" She said in a funny voice. </p><p> I stopped pulling her cheek and kissed her. </p><p> \"Uhunpf?\" She made a funny sound of surprise, but soon she returned my kiss; as we practiced a few times, we were a little more experienced. </p><p> Suddenly, I feel a burst of murderous intent, I stop kissing Violet and look at Sasha with a smile on my face. </p><p> \"Humpf,\" She turned her face away in annoyance. </p><p> This seemed to make Violet satisfied, she smiled lovingly and hugged me possessively. </p><p> \"You know I\'ll never run away from you, right?\" I commented as I stroked Violet\'s white hair down her back. </p><p> \"Yes, but…\" She bit her lip. </p><p> I made her look at me, I needed to say this, \"I don\'t know about Ruby yet, but Sasha is my wife, I want her close to me.\" Violet\'s face distorted in annoyance. </p><p> I look at Sasha and see that she was a little embarrassed. </p><p> \"What do you think about this?\" I asked her opinion. </p><p> \"M-Me?\" She pointed to herself, she didn\'t seem used to showing affection. \"I- I do not know-\" </p><p> Suddenly Kaguya appears beside Sasha and slams her elbow into Sasha\'s stomach. </p><p> \"Ouch! What are you doing!?\" Sasha yelled angrily. </p><p> \"Don\'t be indecisive now, this is about your future,\" Kaguya spoke in a neutral tone. </p><p> \"...\" </p><p> When Sasha heard Kaguya\'s words, she was speechless for a moment. </p><p> I notice Sasha\'s face has changed several times, embarrassed, curious, scared, and a little obsessive? It was quite interesting to see how her face constantly changed. </p><p> \"Bitch, begone. He\'s just mine, my Darling~\" Violet spoke possessively as she hugged me, but she didn\'t look as pissed off as before. </p><p> Suddenly Sasha\'s face changed, her eyes turned blood red, and as soon as she looked at Violet, she gets annoyed. </p><p> \"Huuuh!?\" Her face distorted in anger, \"This bitch.\" </p><p> Sasha gets up from the bed then she uses her speed and appears beside me, she hugs me from behind in a possessive way and says, \"He\'s my husband, bitch!\" </p><p> I feel the sensation of two mature Sasha bunnies on my back, Violet looked at Sasha annoyed then she hugged me too. </p><p> As she was sitting on my lap I could feel Violet\'s two bunnies who weren\'t the same size as Sasha\'s bunnies, but they were a perfect size; they were neither too small nor too big, they were perfect. </p><p> Ahh~, I was in heaven now... </p><p> \"Well, that was somehow resolved by Lord Victor,\" Kaguya spoke with a small smile. </p><p> \"Are you sure? They look like they could kill each other at any time,\" Natalia commented as she looked at Sasha and Violet who were glaring at each other as the two women hugged me possessively. </p><p> \"Well, they can\'t just hold hands and say they\'ll get along with each other, after all, you know Lady Violet\'s personality, right?\" </p><p> \"Indeed,\" Natalia said. </p><p> \"This is just the beginning. Lady Violet is angry at Lady Sasha, but she doesn\'t want to kill Lady Sasha like before; Lady Violet is just acting like a possessive teenager now.\" Kaguya explained, then she continued: </p><p> \"And Lady Sasha has stopped being stubborn about her feelings, and is acting more honestly; that\'s progress for a woman like her who isn\'t used to showing affection openly.\" </p><p> Natalia nods her head and puts her finger on her face, then she commented with a small smile on her face: </p><p> \"I wonder what will happen when Lady Ruby shows up.\" </p><p> Kaguya looked at Natalia with a neutral look, \"You\'re having fun with this whole situation, huh?\" </p><p> Natalia looked at Kaguya, and she commented with a small smile on her face, \"Who knows? I could be having fun, or I could just be pretending.\" </p><p> Kaguya lets out a small sigh when she sees the blonde maid\'s attitude. </p><p> ...</p>'),(183,8,'Chapter 24 - Two Wives',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p> As my two wives hugged me, I looked at Kaguya, \"Kaguya, call that witch here, I need her services.\" </p><p> Kaguya looks in my direction and nods, then, without question, takes a small ball from her pocket and smashes it, soon a magic circle appears on the floor. </p><p> And, slowly, the witch June got off the ground; she was just wearing a big sweatshirt and short shorts, it looked like she was about to go to sleep. </p><p> \"Huh?\" June was surprised for a moment but then she soon asked Kaguya, annoyed, \"Really, Maid? I was in Japan about to go to sleep in a hotel after a good shower in an Onsen!\" </p><p> She knows how to enjoy life with the money she earns, huh? </p><p> Kaguya just looked at June like she was looking at a pile of garbage. </p><p> \"June,\" I said. </p><p> June has stopped looking at Kaguya and looks at me, then her face takes on a shocked expression when she sees me. </p><p> \"Oya, Oya? Has the number of women grown? Isn\'t that Lady Sasha?\" June commented smiling. </p><p> Sasha and Violet stop staring like they want to kill each other and look at June. </p><p> Sasha looks at June confused like she was wondering why June was here, she seemed to know June. </p><p> Violet looks at June neutrally as if she doesn\'t care about her. </p><p> \"How much do I owe, June?\" I asked, I remember I placed an order before and she said she was going to charge me in the future; it\'s better to know how much money I owe her now so I can plan my steps in the future. </p><p> \"Oh?\" June flashes a greedy smile, then she says, \"You owe me a million-\" Just as she was about to complete her sentence, she closed her mouth and looked at Violet with a cold sweat falling off her face. </p><p> Violet looks at June with a small smile on her face, I realize her red eyes are staring at June coldly, \"Excuse me? I didn\'t hear what you said, can you repeat that?\" </p><p> June\'s face darkened a little when she saw Violet\'s expression. </p><p> \"Cough!\" She pretended to cough to change the subject, then continued, \"I mean, you owe me $30,000.\" she said with a gentle smile. </p><p> \"Good,\" Violet said and then hugged me again while ignoring June. </p><p> I also feel Sasha hugging me from behind while looking at June neutrally; she seemed to be breathing down my neck too, although she was doing it quite sneakily. </p><p> I was a little surprised that Violet didn\'t mind Sasha\'s presence right now, but that\'s a good thing. I know it\'s hard for the two of them to get along, but the important thing is they don\'t try to kill each other while I\'m not around. </p><p> But 30,000 dollars, huh? That\'s a big amount, but I think I can get it in one day if I steal from the right thieves. </p><p> \"I need you to make me an outfit and a black mask,\" I tell my order to June. </p><p> \"Huh?\" June looked at me strangely. </p><p> \"What happened, are you going to tell me you can\'t do it?\" I asked. </p><p> \"I mean, I can do that, but your requests are always weird, huh? The first one was a fake ID, and now it\'s clothes? What are you planning?\" She asked with a curious smile. </p><p> \"Knowing about this information is going to cost money, do you really want to know?\" I spoke while smiling a little; I could see June\'s smile twitch a little when she heard my words. </p><p> \"You\'re greedy, huh?\" June commented. </p><p> \"Not much as you,\" I said. </p><p> June looked at me shocked and then started to laugh amusedly, \"Hahahaha. You\'re right, You\'re right, You\'re right! I am a greedy witch!\" </p><p> Suddenly, several magic circles started to appear on the sweatshirt she was wearing. The circles start spinning quickly, and soon several green lights start to come out of June, and, slowly, her outfit starts changing into a professional women\'s suit. </p><p> \"My name is June, Codename the greedy witch. I am the witch who solves all the problems related to the modern world with a certain amount of money, of course.\" She spoke in a professional tone while showing a small smile in the last sentence. </p><p> \"Oh\", I said while clapping my hands a little for the light show. I also noticed that a card appeared in front of me and when I took the card, I saw that it had a golden color and had the name June carved into the card. I think this card was made of pure gold? </p><p> \"Thank you, thank you,\" She spoke gratefully while smiling satisfied; she seemed to be quite narcissistic too. </p><p> \"I never thought this piece of garbage-, Cough... I never thought June would give you her Codename.\" </p><p> \"Hey! I heard that!\" June looked at Kaguya irritably. </p><p> Kaguya just ignored her as she looked at me. </p><p> \"Codename?\" I asked curiously. </p><p> \"Codenames are a title given by the queen of witches. For the society of witches a Codename is a form of status, but not only that, if a witch gives her Codename to someone she judges as a customer, a golden card will appear.\" Sasha explained as she hugged me tighter. \"Using this card, you can contact the witch to request her services anytime you want.\" </p><p> It seems like witches work 24 hours a day, they don\'t seem to get rest. </p><p> \"Oh thank you, Sasha,\" I said gratefully. </p><p> I felt Sasha\'s body tremble a little, \"Mm,\" she made a cute sound and hid her face behind my back. </p><p> \"Tsk,\" Violet clicked her tongue in annoyance; she looked agitated. </p><p> I patted Violet\'s head, and soon her expression changed to a satisfied one as I look at the golden card in my hand and think, \'witch society seems to be more interesting than I thought; a society built on a form of energy called \'magic\', huh?\' </p><p> \"But why did you give this to me? I don\'t have as much money as my wives do, and you know it.\" I told June. </p><p> June looks at me and smiles, \"Yes, I know. You\'re poor now, but I smell money coming from you, and, in the future, you\'ll have a lot of money; I\'m betting on that.\" </p><p> She flashes a confident smile, \"And I never lose when I make a bet.\" </p><p> She smiles like a teenager who has found something interesting and continues, \"Not to mention that you seem to be very close to the two richest heiresses of the noble vampires.\" </p><p> Oh? She doesn\'t know that Sasha\'s Clan has lost its noble status. I feel Sasha\'s face moving a little behind my back; it seems she\'s noticed that too. </p><p> Well, June could be lying, so there\'s no guarantee she doesn\'t know anything. </p><p> \"Getting back to business! What do you need!?\" June asked as her eyes sparkled with the US dollar symbol. </p><p> \"Do you know that anime called Tokyo Vampire?\" I asked. I didn\'t watch the anime, but I saw the protagonist\'s image several times on the internet. </p><p> The protagonist had white hair, different colored eyes, and was wearing a black outfit; he was transformed by a beautiful vampire with purple hair. </p><p> \"Yes, I watched it when I was in Japan.\" </p><p> \"I need an outfit similar to the protagonist\'s, but I want some changes to the outfit... The outfit should look like a straitjacket used to arrest criminals, the boot should be a little bigger, and the mask should just cover my mouth.\" </p><p> \"Okay... Do you intend to cosplay?\" She asked curiously. </p><p> I just looked at her as I smiled and stroked Violet\'s hair, my wife seemed to be much calmer now actually... I think she\'s almost asleep. </p><p> \"If you\'re so curious, I can tell you if you cancel my debt,\" I spoke. </p><p> \"Humpf, forget what I said.\" She gave up, it seems her greed is higher than her curiosity. </p><p> June claps her hands and several magic circles appear a little away from her then, soon, an outfit appears; the outfit that appeared is the anime protagonist\'s outfit, but slowly the outfit began to undergo changes that I asked for. </p><p> \"Do you want something like this?\" She asked. </p><p> I look at the outfit and nod satisfied. \"As expected of a professional witch.\" </p><p> \"Praising me won\'t make me lower the price!\" She spoke with a big smile on her face. </p><p> \"How much did the clothes cost?\" I asked. </p><p> June puts her hand to her chin and looks at the outfit as if she\'s thinking about something. </p><p> I feel Violet move in my arms, she looks at the outfit I ordered and her eyes start to sparkle for a moment; she seems interested in the outfit. I also felt Sasha who was hiding her face behind me peeking a bit at the outfit I asked for, she looks at the outfit for a moment and says: </p><p> \"Cringe.\" </p><p> Oof, I felt a stake piercing my heart... For a moment my smile almost broke, but soon I recovered and said, \"I know, that\'s why I ordered this outfit; no one would ever think a vampire would use this outfit to do what I\'m going to do in the future.\" </p><p> \"I may do it for you for free if you tell me what you intend to do.\" </p><p> \"Denied. You can\'t have everything in life, Witch.\" I spoke with a smile on my face, then I continued, \"Choose, do you want money, or do you want to satisfy your curiosity!?\" </p><p> \"Ugh...\" She makes a difficult face, then she speaks screaming, \"I want both!\" </p><p> \"Umu, as expected from a witch with the title of greedy, but unfortunately, that\'s impossible,\" I said laughing. </p><p> June pouts, she looks very pretty now. </p><p> I feel Violet and Sasha looking at me with a dangerous look, my smile growing, \"How do you know what I was thinking?\" </p><p> \"Our connection told us.\" The two spoke in a neutral tone. </p><p> \"Oh? Interesting.\" So they can feel my emotions and my surface thoughts too, huh? </p><p> I start to think about what I\'m going to do when Violet, Sasha, and I finally get alone. </p><p> Suddenly, I hear two small explosions near me. I look down and see that Violet\'s face was very red and I could see that there was smoke coming out of her head like it had overheated. </p><p> I turn slightly and look at Sasha\'s red face, I could also see little yellow lightning flashing above her head. </p><p> My smile grew even wider, and I couldn\'t help but honestly say, \"You guys are so cute!\" </p><p> Sasha suddenly wakes up from her stupor and screams, \"D-D-Do not look at me!\" She quickly hides her face behind my back, I could even hear her heart beating rapidly. </p><p> Violet just hid her face in my chest while she had a huge smile on her face and, just like Sasha, I could hear Violet\'s heartbeat. </p><p> And once again, I understood that they weren\'t like the vampires in the movies. After all, they weren\'t \'dead\', although normally my wives\' hearts beat very slowly. </p><p> I looked at June and saw her face distorted, she looked like she had eaten something bad; I laughed when I saw her expression, \"How much did the clothes cost me?\" </p><p> \"The clothes didn\'t cost anything.\" </p><p> \"Huh?\" </p><p> \"I just had to use my powers to create the outfit, I didn\'t use any complex incantations or anything like that, I just created fabric. That\'s something very easy to do.\" </p><p> \"Oh? You are very honest.\" I said surprised </p><p> For some reason her face turned red, \"Humpf, I just did it for free because I have a long friendship with Lady Violet and because I can create fabric easily, make no mistake! You still owe me!\" </p><p> Why is she acting like this all of a sudden? </p><p> \"I see, thanks,\" I said with a small smile. </p><p> \"Humpf,\" She turned her face away and started muttering something about how it wasn\'t fair and she should look for a boyfriend or something. </p><p> \"Can you create another outfit for Violet? Of course in a female version.\" </p><p> \"Huh?\" Violet was surprised. </p><p> June looks at me and nods, then she claps her hands again, and what happened before is repeated. Soon an outfit similar to mine except in a female version was next to my outfit. </p><p> I looked at Violet, \"You looked interested, so I got you one.\" </p><p> \"Darling~!\" She suddenly climbs on top of me with a crazed smile on her face and bites me!? </p><p> I feel my blood draining down my neck. </p><p> \"Bitch!\" Sasha got annoyed for some reason, and soon she bites my collarbone and starts sucking my blood. </p><p> Feeling my wives\' emotions and desires, slowly, my teeth start to change, and my eyes change to blood red, then I bite Violet\'s collarbone! </p><p> \"Ahh~\" Violet stopped sucking my blood and moaned a little as she hugged me tighter. </p><p> Kaguya, Maria, June, and Natalia, who were seeing this, all react differently. </p><p> \"For some reason, I feel like I should get a boyfriend,\" June commented. </p><p> \"No man will want a gold digger like you,\" Kaguya spoke in an emotionless tone. </p><p> \"Huuuh?\" June\'s face distorted in anger, \"Are you frustrated that your master is being stolen from you, Maid?\" </p><p> Kaguya\'s eyes flutter a little, and she is silent; she didn\'t want to waste time talking to June. </p><p> June, thinking she\'s guessed right, started to smile, \"I feel sorry for you, Maid; Lady Violet will be stolen from you.\" </p><p> Seeing that Kaguya didn\'t react to her words, June was confused, then she thought, \'Did I get my guess wrong?\' </p><p> \"Lady June, I have a job for you.\" Natalia suddenly said. </p><p> \"Oh?\" June loses interest in Kaguya and looks at Natalia with greedy eyes. </p><p> \"I want you to investigate what is happening in this city,\" Natalia said. </p><p> Kaguya, who listened to what Natalia said, began to pay attention to the conversation. </p><p> \"According to Lady Sasha, and Kaguya. A vampire named Lucy stole something from the church, I want to know what that \'something\' is.\" </p><p> June makes a very serious expression, \"This is going to cost a lot of money, you know?\" </p><p> \"I know,\" Natalia said smiling, then she continued, \"Money is not a problem, just investigate it for me\" </p><p> \"I accept your request but remember you must pay 50% of the money upfront, and if another witch is helping the church, I can\'t interfere too much. After all, you know the rules of witches, right?\" </p><p> Natalia smiles gently: \"Rule number 1 of witches, a witch must not conflict with another witch. If the witch\'s employer is an enemy of an individual who is hiring another witch, both witches must abandon their duty immediately.\" She explained as she was remembering, and then she continued: </p><p> \"Of course I know.\" </p><p> \"good.\" </p><p> June throws two small spheres at Kaguya, and soon she disappears into a magic circle. </p><p> Kaguya raises her hands and takes the two spheres June threw and puts them in her pocket, \"An Ordinary Maid doesn\'t get enough money to pay a witch for this kind of service,\" she commented. </p><p> Natalia just displays a gentle smile and doesn\'t say anything, soon she walks towards a wall and goes through a secret passage. </p><p> \"Tsk, I don\'t like this,\" Kaguya said, annoyed, when she saw Natalia leaving without giving an explanation, then she looked at Victor, who was biting his wife\'s neck, and several thoughts were going through Kaguya\'s head now. </p><p> ...</p>'),(184,8,'Chapter 25 - Professor Adam',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p> After solving the problems with my wives and getting an outfit to disguise myself as James Smith, I go to college. When I get to college, I notice the students looking at me differently; they seemed to recognize me from the game that I played with Luan yesterday. </p><p> I also noticed some female students staring at me as if they were looking at prey, some male students were staring at me with explicit disdain on their faces. </p><p> Seeing all this, I just ignored it all and walked towards my classroom. </p><p> \"Isn\'t he that player who jumped off across court yesterday? Did you see the video?\" A man spoke. </p><p> \"Yes, and to think that there was a player with those skills in this school... How did he never get recognized?\" Another asked. </p><p> ...I think I overreacted... Meh, I didn\'t mean to hide my changes from the start, what\'s the point of gaining powers if you can\'t use them? </p><p> I just have to avoid doing something humanly impossible, like jump to the height of a building or something. If things get out of hand I just have to get out of college, after all, I decided to stay in college just to satisfy my desire to play sports. </p><p> Arriving in the classroom, I realize I arrived too early; I look around and soon I see my economics teacher. He is a tall man, I think he is 200 cm tall, he has an amazing white mustache, white hair, and sapphire blue eyes; he was wearing a well-fitting suit and, despite being over 60 years old, he looked like a man who was in his 30s. In the past when his family and I went for a walk, I could see that under those clothes he wears there is a man with a well-trained body... </p><p> How did he manage to keep his body toned after being over 60 years of age? </p><p> \"Oh, Victor... It\'s been a while since I\'ve seen you in my class.\" He spoke with a small smile on his face as he turned and looked at me. </p><p> Looking into Adam\'s sapphire blue eyes, I felt an instinctive danger in my body but, the moment I felt that danger, the feeling I got disappeared as if everything I felt was an illusion. </p><p> But I knew this wasn\'t an illusion… I decided to keep this incident locked in my head. </p><p> \"Professor Adam... You talk as if we haven\'t known each other for years, it\'s only been three days since I came to your class.\" </p><p> He laughed a little with an amused smile and said, \"Indeed.\" </p><p> I walk up to the teacher and the closer I got to him, I couldn\'t help but look at his height with a bit of shock; he was the tallest man I\'ve seen in person and a two-meter tall man can be very intimidating. </p><p> He leans against his desk and folds his arms as he looks at me, \"Tell me the news, I hear you had a show yesterday on the basketball court.\" </p><p> \"Do you know that too?\" I asked in mock surprise. </p><p> \"Everyone at this college knows what happened and you made a lot of enemies yesterday, after all, there are a lot of people who worship the captain of the basketball team.\" He commented casually. </p><p> \"Oh?\" I display a small smile on my face. </p><p> He looked at my smile and soon he exhibited a smile of his own as if he understood something, \"But you don\'t mind, right?\" </p><p> \"How do you know?\" I asked with mock shock as if he had discovered a big secret but, of course, I was still smiling. </p><p> \"Heh Kid, how long do you think I\'ve known you? I\'ve watched you grow up with my kids, I know your personality very well.\" He chuckled. </p><p> He and I laugh together in fun, this teacher is an old acquaintance of mine; he is the father of two of my childhood friends, Leona and Edward, this man\'s name is Adam William Lykos. </p><p> \"But don\'t cause too much trouble, the dean of this college is supporting Luan, and he might try to do something with you.\" </p><p> \"Is he going to try to kick me out of college or something?\" I spoke in disdain, if it was before I would be worried, but now? Now, I don\'t care anymore. </p><p> \"Probably yes, but seeing as how you don\'t care, I think it\'s okay with you? Just don\'t cause too much trouble since that might make your parents sad.\" He warned me. </p><p> \"I appreciate the concern, but don\'t worry about my family; I\'m sure my parents won\'t be upset about something like that.\" After all, knowing my mother, if she finds out about every incident from beginning to end, she is going to try to sue the school. What about my dad? He\'ll just nod at me satisfied, after all, he was the kind of man who works things out with his fist in the past. </p><p> \"Well, if you\'re saying so,\" Adam said as if it didn\'t really matter to him. </p><p> \"You look paler than before, are you eating well?\" he asked curiously. </p><p> \"Yes, with the food my mom gave me, I even gained muscle, look,\" I said while pointing to my arm. </p><p> \"Hahaha,\" He laughed like he thought of something very funny. He and I both know I was lying but, as expected from my childhood friend\'s father, he\'s a man who doesn\'t care much about things that don\'t involve his kids directly. </p><p> From what I understand of Adam\'s personality, he\'s the kind of man who can see the world burn and he won\'t care. He would only care about something if his kids were in the crossfire, he\'s very protective of his family, and that\'s why he and I get along, after all, we are alike. </p><p> \"You tell good jokes, Victor.\" He spoke with a small smile. </p><p> \"I didn\'t try to joke, as always your sense of humor is weird,\" I commented. </p><p> \"Try to live as long as I do, I\'m sure you\'ll have a few screws loose in your head.\" </p><p> He looks into my eyes and speaks in a deep voice like he\'s inducing me to do something, I even notice that his blue eyes sparkled for a few seconds, \"What do you think, Victor? Why don\'t you loosen up a little?\" </p><p> \"Huh? What are you talking about, teacher?\" I asked confused. </p><p> He closes his eyes and sighs a little relieved, then he smiled, \"I was asking how long will you hide behind this \'mask\' that you created yourself.\" </p><p> \"...Adam, you know that all beings with intelligence in this world who live in society hide their true \'self\', right?\" I spoke with a cold little smile. </p><p> \"Indeed, after all, we weird beings have to adapt to society.\" He spoke in a neutral tone, then looked at his watch. </p><p> \"Victor, class is starting are you going to participate, or are you going somewhere?\" He asked. </p><p> \"I\'m going to the swim club,\" I said, I need to experiment to see if I have weakness in the water. </p><p> \"Oh, I see, as I\'ve known you for a long time, I\'m going to put that you were present in today\'s class,\" He said. </p><p> \"Thank you, Professor Adam.\" He didn\'t need to do this but, as it\'s a kind gesture, I just have to thank him. </p><p> Soon I leave the classroom and walk towards the swim club. </p><p> When Victor left the classroom, Adam walked towards the window and, with a simple gesture of strength, he jumps towards a tree. Then, soon after, he jumps towards a building away from the college; all his actions were very soft, it was like he hadn\'t made any noise at all. </p><p> On top of a tall building away from the college, Adam sighed to himself in relief, then he picks up a phone and searches the list for the contact named \'My princess\'. </p><p> Adam coughed a little to disguise that he was relieved about something and clicked to call his daughter, the phone rings a little, and soon his daughter answers. </p><p> \"Father,\" Leona spoke into the phone. </p><p> \"Oh, my little princess,\" He spoke with a satisfied smile on his face. </p><p> \"Have you discovered something?\" Leona asked impatiently. </p><p> Adam\'s smile breaks a little, but he replies, \"Yes. Unfortunately, he\'s not from your family; he didn\'t react to my pressure like a newborn wolf would, and I also didn\'t feel the connection indicating he was from my pack.\" </p><p> \"Oh...\" </p><p> Hearing his daughter\'s disappointed reaction, Adam quickly speaks, \"But don\'t worry! The wolf\'s transformation may be dormant, after all, just like you, he could just wake up on a night with a full moon!\" He tried to cheer her up. </p><p> \"You\'re wrong, Dad.\" Leona sighed. </p><p> \"Hmm?\" Adam pretended not to understand. </p><p> \"He won\'t become a member of my pack... The wolf\'s venom has been neutralized by the vampire\'s venom, Victor is a vampire now...\" </p><p> Of course, Adam knew this, but he still reacted in surprise, \"Oh? Is he a vampire? Why do you think that?\" </p><p> \"Well, the changes are obvious, and he\'s married to the Snow Clan\'s heiress, and Clan Fulger\'s\" </p><p> \"Oh…? I didn\'t know that.\" Adam was really surprised this time and he started to think; Wolf\'s venom wouldn\'t be an easy thing to neutralize, especially my daughter\'s venom... But if two noble vampires bit him, it makes sense that wolf venom would be neutralized.\' </p><p> \"What do we do, father?\" Leona asked a little apprehensively. </p><p> \"Huh?\" Adam wakes up from his thoughts, and responds, \"We don\'t do anything.\" </p><p> \"...Why?\" </p><p> \"As Victor isn\'t a wolf, he\'s not our problem anymore, he\'s just a leech now,\" Adam spoke in a definite tone. </p><p> \"But-\" Leona tried to say something, but Adam cut it off and spoke seriously as his eyes glowed a little bright blue. </p><p> \"I forbid you to get involved with him.\" </p><p> \"Father!\" Leona yelled angrily. </p><p> \"Leona, who do you think you\'re talking to? Lower your voice,\" Adam growled, he likes to spoil his daughter, but he wouldn\'t forgive the insubordination. </p><p> \"I-I u-understand, I will-\" Leona stops talking, and Adam can hear that she was sobbing and crying a little. </p><p> His eyes slowly began to lose their intensity, and he sighed, \"You fool, I don\'t forbid you from treating him like normal friends... What I forbid is that you get involved in leech affairs, that\'s not our problem.\" </p><p> \"R-Rigth~\" Leona spoke in a tone like she was crying. </p><p> \"I\'ll hang up, class is starting,\" Adam said sighing again. </p><p> ... </p><p> When Adam hangs up, Leona wipes her tears away with the toilet paper, and sighs. </p><p> She was currently in the service area where she usually works taking care of animals. </p><p> \"You\'re good at acting,\" Edward spoke in a neutral tone, he heard and saw everything Leona did, he even saw her start to sob and cry out of nowhere. </p><p> \"Shut up,\" Leona said, then she snorted proudly, \"I learned acting watching K-Drama\" </p><p> \"Only our dad would fall for this horrible act,\" Edward said as he rolled his eyes. </p><p> Leona pouted, and looked at her brother, \"What do we do?\" </p><p> \"Nothing.\" Edward spoke, then he continued: \"Victor turned into a vampire, so what? I\'ve known him since he was little, I know he won\'t act like an emo and say we\'re enemies or some shit like that, just treat him normally.\" </p><p> \"Hmm, you\'re right...\" Leona spoke a little unsurely. </p><p> \"…Did you want him as a member of the family?\" Edward asked. </p><p> \"Huh?\" Leona\'s face turned a little red when she heard her brother\'s question. </p><p> \"I understand, I understand.\" He nods his head several times as if he understands something: \"You\'ve known each other since you were a child, and you had a similar situation, after all, you and he were sick. He was always kind to you and, because of that, you\'re in love with him. You expected him to become a wolf so you could get close to him, and develop this relationship, right? This is the basic plot of any romance anime.\" </p><p> Slowly, Leona\'s face began to turn completely red with embarrassment. </p><p> Soon Edward continues, \"If you followed the plot of an anime, you would approach Victor, and you would start dating him, after all, the childhood friend always wins in this type of plot.\" </p><p> Edward makes a serious face and an exaggerated gesture, \"But you didn\'t expect a YANDERE to show up and steal the man you were in love with!\" He points to Leona who had a completely red face. </p><p> \"And if one Yandere wasn\'t enough, he got two Yandere! And, when we talk about Yandere, there\'s only one thing we can expect... Trouble! And since he has two yanderes, he has double problems!\" </p><p> Leona started to clench her fist angrily and looked at her brother like he was a dead man. </p><p> Seeing his sister\'s face, Edward stopped joking and looked at her with a puzzled face, \"Don\'t tell me that\'s it...?\" </p><p> Soon Edward\'s face turns red with anger, \"I forbid-\" he tried to say something, but before he could finish the sentence, Leona made a move. </p><p> \"You Fucking Idiot!!\" She made a fist and attacked Edward\'s stomach. </p><p> \"Ugh-\" Edward didn\'t expect this sudden attack, so he flies towards the wall as a fist imprint appeared on his stomach. </p><p> \"Humpf\" Leona huffed, \"You\'re wrong, I\'m not in love with him, I treat him like a precious friend stop making up lies! I just didn\'t want him to fall into those leeches\' traps!\" Soon she turned and left the room where she was. </p><p> \"Cough, Cough,\" Edward coughed a little as he came out of the wall that had the silhouette of his body and says, \"She\'s getting stronger at a very fast pace... And it\'s only been three days since she woke up as a wolf, soon, she won\'t be a fragile girl anymore... She\'ll turn into a gorilla.\" </p><p> ...</p>'),(185,9,'Chapter 1 Just an old Book',_binary '<p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 1 Just an old Book</h3><p></p><p>\"Don\'t die by falling over Quinn! \"A boy shouted down the hallway.</p><p>Quin carried on walking down the school corridor. Harassment had become a daily occurrence for him but it still bothered him just as much every day and he couldn\'t help himself but retaliate. </p><p>Quinn stopped and pushed his glasses back up as they had slipped down from his face. He needed a new pair and just from looking at them, you could tell they were heavily worn. The sides were covered with tape and they didn\'t even fit straight on his face.</p><p>Quinn then turned around and immediately gave the middle finger. </p><p>\"I bet you don\'t even know how many fingers I\'m holding up!\"</p><p>The boy clenched his fist and started running towards Quinn. </p><p>\"You level 1 piece of crap! When are you going to learn that you don\'t belong in this world?\"</p><p>The boy then placed both of his hands together and a green ball of light started to form. When he was only a few meters away from Quinn, the boy threw his hands forward and the green light shot out from the palm of his hands. </p><p>Quinn had nowhere to go and the beam of light was too fast for him to dodge. All he could do was grit his teeth and bear the pain. As the light hit Quinn, his body was lifted into the air and sent flying backwards into the corridor wall. </p><p>\"What\'s going on?\" One of the students nearby said. \"Are they fighting on the last day of school?\"</p><p>A crowd had immediately formed outside as people were interested in what the commotion was about. One of the female students ran over to the damaged part of the wall to check on the student\'s safety. </p><p>The dust started to settle and Quinn\'s slightly curly black hair was coming into view. When eventually the dust all cleared up and the female saw who it was, she immediately backed away and continued her business as if nothing happened. </p><p>When the female student had returned to her friends, Quinn could see that they were laughing at her. </p><p>\"I can\'t believe you tried to help him.\"</p><p>\"I didn\'t see who it was.\" The girl retorted with flushed cheeks. </p><p>After that, Quinn stood up and picked his glasses up off the floor. Once again one of the sides had fallen off.</p><p>\"Dam it. Not again...\" </p><p>It was the last day of school for Quinn and he was hoping just once someone wouldn\'t try anything with him. Quinn was sick and tired of it and he wasn\'t the type to ignore it either. He had seen people who had chosen to keep their head down and tolerate the harassment and their treatment was far worse than what he got. </p><p>Quinn didn\'t bother to stay at school like the rest of the students. As he walked past, he saw people talking to each other. Some were laughing while some had tears thinking it was the last time they would ever see each other again but Quinn wasn\'t a part of any of that and he didn\'t want to be. </p><p>When he finally arrived home, Quinn immediately got to work. Quinn lived in a single bedroom apartment that had just enough space to fit a single bed and desk. There was also a TV that was part of the wall but Quinn would only use it as background noise and didn\'t actually watch anything.</p><p>ChapterMid();</p><p>The apartment was provided to him by the government since he had no living relatives and was still only 16. On top of his bed was a single suit case that had all his belongings neatly packed. </p><p>When Quinn entered his room, he immediately pulled his drawer open which contained a book inside. It was a large thick book that weighed about half a kilo. The front of the book was black in colour and in the centre, it had a ring with lines going off in all different directions. </p><p>\"Let\'s try again today.\" Quinn said as he placed the book on the desk. </p><p>He then immediately went to his bag to pull out a little test tube which had a clear liquid inside. </p><p>\"Test 112, Hydrochloric acid. Let\'s see how it goes.\" Quinn then started to slowly pour the liquid out of the test tube and onto the book. </p><p>\"So far no reaction.\" Quinn then continued to pour the whole test tube onto the book but still there was no reaction. </p><p>Quinn carefully examined the book to see if there was any damage done but the book looked the same as always. </p><p>\"Another failure. Why won\'t you open? Why did mum and dad even have this thing?\" </p><p>One hundred twelve times. This was the number of different ways that Quinn had tried to open the book. Not only would the book not open, but it seemed like it wasn\'t able to be damaged either. Quin had tried burning the book, cutting the book, melting the book...but nothing had worked. </p><p>Quinn then went to lie on his bed and turned on the TV for some background noise. He never really paid attention to what was on but the sound of other voices made him feel less lonely. </p><p>The TV was currently tuned into the news station. </p><p>\"The peace treaty with the Dalki race has lasted for five years now but officials say that tension is rising once again and we must prepare for another war….\"</p><p>The mention of war had always been shown on the TV nonstop since that day. Thirty years ago, the human race received a visit from the so-called Dalki. They looked like humans except for their dragon-like tail and scale-like skin. </p><p>They immediately demanded that the Human race hand over their resources and wanted to use them as slaves. Of course, the humans decided to fight back but they quickly found out that their modern technology was useless against them. Bullets couldn\'t penetrate their skin and as for tanks, well Dalki had airships. </p><p>Every man and woman was told to fight for their planet and that included Quinn\'s parents. The war went on for years and Quinn grew up not knowing what his parents looked like. </p><p>When the humans were on the brink of defeat, a select few came forward. These people had special abilities. They began sharing their knowledge of how they obtained such power in hopes of turning the tide in the war and it worked. Even so, the Dalki were still strong and a seemingly endless stalemate lead to the peace treaty signing five years ago. </p><p>Of course, human greed got the better of humanity and instead of sharing these powers with everyone, the higher ranked governmental officials decided to keep them for themselves. Only those with money were able to learn the more powerful abilities while everyone else was left with scraps. </p><p>Quinn was given nothing when his parents died. The government agreed to pay for his living accommodation while he was still in school but that was it. When his parents died at the age of ten, an agent appeared at his doorstep and handed him a book. He was told this was the only thing his parents possessed which they passed down when they died. </p><p>\"Why is the world so unfair?\"</p><p>Quinn got out of his bed and started walking over to his desk. He picked up his glasses that were still slightly broken and decided he needed to fix them. He noticed that one of the lenses was slightly out of place and tried to punch it back into its frame. </p><p>\"Come on, just get in!\" He shouted as he pushed down hard. </p><p>The lens suddenly smashed into pieces and one of the shards of glass created a deep gash in his thumb. </p><p>\"Why does the world hate me.\"</p><p>Quinn immediately started to clean up the little pieces of glass and noticed a piece had landed on top of his book. As Quinn removed the piece of glass, a drop of blood from his thumb landed in the centre of the book. </p><p>The ring around the centre of the book started to glow and suddenly the book started to lift itself into the air. </p><p>\"What the hell is happening!\" </p><p>The book started to shine brightly and shake uncontrollably. It finally opened up and page after page was being turned. Quinn couldn\'t take his eyes off the shining book as if he was in a deep trance. The words written in the book weren\'t in any language he had seen before but for some reason, he felt like he could understand it. </p><p>When the book finally turned its last page, it started to disappear as if it was slowly turning to dust. At the same time, Quinn\'s vision was starting to fade. His body felt weak and his eyes slowly shut.</p><p>But just before he passed out, there was a single message that he heard.</p><p>&lt;Congratulations you have been granted the Va....&gt;</p><p>Unable to maintain consciousness long enough to hear the final words, Quinn passed out.</p>'),(186,9,'Chapter 2 Daily Quest',_binary '<p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 2: Daily Quest</h3><p></p><p>Gradually, Quinn\'s eyelids started to flutter open and his vision soon returned. Although, his head felt heavy and his body was slightly sore. As he lifted himself off of the ground, he touched his head to see if he had gotten any injuries. </p><p>\'Why does my head hurt so much?\' He thought, bewildered of what just happened to him.</p><p>After making sure that his skull hadn\'t split open from falling over, Quinn then went to pick up his glasses that were thrown on the floor not to far from him. Regrettably, there was only one lens that was left intact, still, Quinn put the glasses on out of habit. All of a sudden, he felt a little disoriented and his vision was slightly blurry.</p><p>He took them back off and noticed that his vision only turned hazy when he put the glasses on. Quinn immediately rushed to his desk to grab a pencil. He proceeded to draw the letter \"A\" on the wall and stepped back. He continued to step back until his back had hit the wall that was on the other side of the room. </p><p>\"What?! But how?!\" Quinn screamed in his mind.</p><p>Somehow, Quinn\'s vision was now perfect. He had lived his whole life with terrible eyesight, but strangely, he could now see clearly. Images then started to flash in his head regarding what had happened before he passed out. After reminiscing, he could only think of one thing that caused the miracle - The book. </p><p>When Quinn surveyed the room, he started to panic.</p><p>\"The book! Where the hell\'s the book?\"</p><p>Quinn looked everywhere for the book, yet he couldn\'t find anything. It couldn\'t have gone missing in such a small room, so its disappearance was making Quinn go mad.</p><p>\"Maybe it\'s like my socks. They go missing all the time. Ahh, don\'t be stupid. This is a book we\'re talking about, not a sock.\" He muttered, trying to reason the uncanny comparison.</p><p>Quinn attempted to think hard about what had occurred a few moments before he collapsed. He suddenly started to remember the book hovering in the air. Then, just before closing his eyes, he heard a few words.</p><p>\"What was it? It sounded like some type of system message?\"</p><p>As soon as Quinn said those words, a status screen had appeared right in front of his eyes.</p><p>&lt;User: Quinn Talen&gt;</p><p>&lt;Race: Human&gt;</p><p>&lt;Level 1&gt;</p><p>&lt;0/100 exp&gt;</p><p>&lt;HP 10/10&gt;</p><p>&lt;Strength: 10&gt;</p><p>&lt;Agility: 10&gt;</p><p>&lt;Stamina: 10&gt;</p><p>\"Wow! It\'s like those really old games that people used to play all the time.\"</p><p>Quinn noticed that, on the status screen, there were more tabs that were placed on the top. Accordingly, even without doing anything and just by reading the tabs in his head, the screen automatically switched to the &lt;Skills&gt; tab.</p><p>&lt;Skills&gt;</p><p>&lt;0 skill points available&gt;</p><p>&lt;Skill locked????&gt;</p><p>&lt;Skill locked????&gt;</p><p>….</p><p>On the skills tab, Quinn wasn\'t really able to see much. Everything seemed to be locked and slightly greyed out, so he quickly moved on to the next tab, &lt;Shop&gt;.</p><p>&lt;Shop&gt;</p><p>&lt;Unlocks at level 10&gt;</p><p>\"Can I do anything?\"</p><p>The last tab was the &lt;Quest&gt; tab. Finally, it seemed like a tab that wasn\'t locked behind a requirement.</p><p>&lt;Main Quest&gt;</p><p>&lt;Reach level 10&gt;</p><p>&lt;Daily Quest: Drink two litres of water&gt;</p><p>&lt;Reward: 5 exp &gt;</p><p>After checking everything that the system had to offer, Quinn had to just think about closing the system and it did. When Quinn thought about opening it again, a screen would immediately pop up in front of him.</p><p>Quinn could only think of one thing - The book that his parents had left him was an ability book. These books could often be bought at very high prices from the military or a company. Some were even sold on the market place.</p><p>However, the sole issue was that Quinn had never heard of an ability book that promptly disappeared, granting the user a system such as the one he currently had. The ability books were designed to be learnt manually. It wasn\'t something that one could pick up and instantly understand how to use.</p><p>A smile started to slowly appear on Quinn\'s face. This was great news for him. He had always been a level 1 ability user because he could never afford to buy any ability books. To his fortune, he had something that he could use. He readily contemplated on what to do and ended up moving on to the next phase, which was testing the ability.</p><p>\"Water bending, come on!\" Quinn said as he raised his right palm forward, acting like he was going to shoot water out or cause it to flow from the kitchen sink.</p><p>\"Ok next! Wind, Wind, out!\" Quinn did the same again, but there was nothing happening.</p><p>After trying out many different things according to all the abilities that he had seen before, it turned out that he was unable to perform any of them.</p><p>\"What the hell is this useless thing? Is it really just a system ability?\"</p><p>Quinn thought about it for a while. If it truly was like a game, then perhaps, by completing the quests, he would eventually get stronger and unlock more skills. It was his mistake that he was treating it like an ordinary ability book when clearly, what he had obtained wasn\'t something that conformed to the word ordinary. </p><p>Usually, ability books were based around one ability. It was important for a person to select their first ability book since a regular human body would only be able to perform one ability attribute. If one got transformability as their first ability, they would only be able to acquire other skills that were related to this attribute. For example, if someone obtained fire as their attribute, they could solely dedicate themselves into gathering skills that the attribute fire could utilize. </p><p>Quinn went to open his mini-fridge, grabbing the bottles of water that were inside. He soon began downing the water bottles one by one. </p><p>\"Damn, how much are two litres? My belly feels like it\'s going to burst.\"</p><p>After finishing his fourth bottle of water, a new notification message had appeared.</p><p>&lt;Daily Quest complete, 5 exp has been granted&gt;</p><p>&lt;5/100&gt;</p><p>\"Well, at least I know how the system works now,\" Quinn said, satisfaction was evident in his tone. </p><p>Unanticipatedly, a loud knock was heard coming from the door. Quinn quickly went and opened it. As he opened the passageway, standing in front of him was a large, muscular, bald-headed man wearing a black military uniform. Also, there were several medals on his garment. His name was written on the area of the uniform right above his chest - \'Seargent Griff\'.</p><p>\"Boy, it is time for you to vacate your room immediately. The vehicle has been waiting outside for 5 minutes already.\"</p><p>With everything that had happened, Quinn had forgotten about what was going to happen to him today.</p><p>\"It\'s time for you to head to military school,\" Griff announced. </p><p>Quinn just gulped, staring back at the officer, as tension enveloped the entirety of his body.</p>'),(187,9,'Chapter 3 Miltary School',_binary '<p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 3 Miltary School</h3><p></p><p>Due to the War between Humans and the Dalki, every person when they reached the age of 16 was required to go to military school for two years. Even though Humans and Dalki were in a peaceful period, everyone knew that it wouldn\'t last forever.</p><p>Every day there was news of one race antagonizing the other and war felt like it could start at any moment.</p><p>Quinn quickly went to the toilet before heading off with Sergeant Griff. His bladder felt like it was going to burst any second now due to all the water he drank.</p><p>Once Quinn stepped out of his room into the outside world, something strange happened. A new notification screen had appeared.</p><p>&lt;Your body is being hit by direct sunlight&gt;</p><p>&lt;You are affected by the sunlight&gt;</p><p>&lt;All stats will be halved while in the sunlight&gt;</p><p>Suddenly, Quinn\'s body felt extremely sluggish. It felt like he had just gone for a 5k Run and returned, his arms and legs felt heavier and there was nothing he could do about it.</p><p>Quinn then went to check his status and saw that his stats did indeed go down by half but it wasn\'t just his stats but his HP as well.</p><p>&lt;HP 5/5&gt;</p><p>&lt;Strength 5/5&gt;</p><p>&lt;Stamina 5/5&gt;</p><p>&lt;Agility 5/5&gt;</p><p>\"What kind of drawback is this!\" Quinn thought.</p><p>Then a new notification had appeared.</p><p>&lt;You have received a new Daily quest: Avoid direct sunlight for 8 hours &gt;</p><p>&lt; reward 5 Exp&gt;</p><p>Quinn\'s mood slightly changed as soon as he saw the new daily quest. Unlike the water one, this was something he was able to do naturally just by sleeping. If the system worked the same way it did in games, then that meant once Quinn had reached 100 exp points he would be able to level up and also level up his stats.</p><p>So the more daily quests Quinn got, the better it was for him.</p><p>\"What are you doing walking so slowly! The School will eat you alive if you carry on like that!\" Griff shouted.</p><p>Finally, Quinn had reached a large bus which was parked just outside his house. When he entered the bus, he noticed that it was already full of students all the same age as him.</p><p>He didn\'t recognize any of the students though, meaning they had all come from a different school. Quinn then went to sit at the front of the bus which was the only seat that was still available.</p><p>&lt;Stats have returned to normal&gt;</p><p>As soon as Quinn had entered the bus and avoided the direct sunlight, his stats had returned to normal and his body felt re-energized once again.</p><p>\"Well, at least it looks like it\'s only direct sunlight.\"</p><p>The students were all talking to each other in excitement but that quickly stopped as soon as sergeant Griff came on board.</p><p>\"Alright, it\'s time for us to head to the military academy.\"</p><p>The bus then started to move and the students were finally on their way. The bus remained silent during the journey. Whenever a student would start to speak Griff immediately would look in their direction and the student would shut up.</p><p>ChapterMid();</p><p>Griff didn\'t even have to say anything, they all knew what he wanted just by looking at him.</p><p>Then about 10 minutes into the journey Quinn once again received another message.</p><p>&lt;A substance in the air has been detected &gt;</p><p>&lt;You are feeling sleepy&gt;</p><p>&lt;Resistance +1&gt;</p><p>Quinn found this message quite strange and then when he started to look around the bus, he noticed that nearly all of the students were either asleep or dosing off.</p><p>Suddenly, even his own eyelids started to feel dizzy.</p><p>&lt;Your resistance to the substance has increased&gt;</p><p>&lt;Resistance +1&gt;</p><p>Then the sound of loud footsteps could be heard coming towards him, as he looked up he noticed Sergeant Griff hovering above him.</p><p>\"Looks like a few of you were able to resist the sleeping gas. Then we will just have to bag you.\"</p><p>Aa black bag was then thrown on top of Quinn\'s head and his vision now was completely covered. The gas started to slowly seep through and Quinn managed to doze off into a nice sleep.</p><p>Then the next moment, Quinn could feel a splash of cold water being chucked on his face. His eyes opened instantly and all he could see was the green grass.</p><p>He and several other students started to lift their heads to lock around them. There were currently a total of 200 students stood out on a plain open field But when they looked around they were in a place that was completely foreign to them.</p><p>\"This is where you will spend the next two years of your life.\"</p><p>The students were amazed at what they were seeing. They were currently in a city like they had never seen before. Everyone was dressed up in military uniform and there were technology and engineering around them that was too advanced for their time. Giant robots moving crates and building machines.</p><p>Flying ships, and levitating trains. It was a technology that hadn\'t been given to the outside world yet and was kept for the military only.</p><p>After the first war with the Dalki Race, the humans had managed to make leaps in technological advancement. This was because they had managed to salvage equipment from them after the war but of course, the military decided to keep most of it for themselves.</p><p>When Quinn finally stopped being amazed at his surroundings, he noticed that there was something placed around his wrist. It looked similar to a digital watch but there was nothing displaying on the screen. </p><p>\"That there on your wrist is your lifeline. It will identify you as a student at this military base. It will allow you to access certain areas, pay for food and all sorts. It is your lifeline at this academy. That isn\'t the only thing that it will display though. When not in use the Wristwatch will display a single number and that number is your power level.</p><p>As soon as Quinn heard those words, he gritted his teeth and clenched his fist. He thought his life might change was coming to military school but it seemed like it was going to be the same even here.</p><p>\"With that, we will immediately begin the level test for you all, good luck!\" Griff said with a smile on his face.</p>'),(188,9,'Chapter 4 Ability Level',_binary '<p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 4 Ability Level</h3><p></p><p>When abilities were first introduced to the human race, people quickly learned that some were far more powerful than others. With this came the introduction of the power level system. There was a total of 8 different power levels. 1 being the weakest and 8 being the strongest. These levels could also be further divided into 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 all the way to 1.9 and it was the same for each level. </p><p>There were two ways for people to obtain abilities. When the war started with the Dalki Race, people started to share their powers with the outside world. They wrote down how they obtained this power and putt the information down in things called, ability books.</p><p>These ability books went on for sale to the public and the military kept some of the stronger ones to themselves. Generally, ability books from level 1 to 5 were sold to the public. While giant corporations and the military kept the higher ones to themselves.</p><p>The second way to obtain an ability was if you were an Original. Originals were the first people who had originally discovered the powers for themselves and decided to pass it down within their family.</p><p>Not all ability users chose to share their abilities to do outside world and decided to keep it within their bloodline. Originals usually had the strongest abilities that went beyond level 8. There was no way for the government to measure its power because it wasn\'t public knowledge.</p><p>Because of these two reasons, Quinn had always been a level 1. He had no family members to support him, so he couldn\'t afford an ability book and his family had no abilities themselves so he wasn\'t an Original.</p><p>When Quinn had obtained the book, his first guess was that it was some time of an ability book, now after all these years, it seemed like he had obtained an ability. But he had never heard of an ability book like this before and he didn\'t have a clue what power level it had given him.</p><p>Quinn lifted up his hand to look at the watch which indicated his current power level was one. When he looked around, he noticed that everyone else\'s watches currently indicated the same number. </p><p>Griff was currently standing in front of all the students and called names in groups of five.</p><p>These students would then be transported somewhere to take the test. Quinn was hopeful at first thinking that he might have been able to change his ability level for once but his mind was quickly changed after receiving a notification.</p><p>&lt;You are being hit by direct sunlight&gt;</p><p>&lt;all stats will be halved&gt;</p><p>Quinn didn\'t even know how good 10 strength, 10 agility, and 10 stamina was but if his eyes sight was anything to go by. Then it would mean it was at least the top condition of a normal human being but right now Quinn felt incredibly weak and sluggish.</p><p>His body felt extremely hot right now and he was sweating buckets of water. Quinn thought it was a good thing he drank a load of water beforehand, otherwise he would have been extremely dehydrated. </p><p>\"Hey, are you okay?\" A stranger standing next to Quinn said.</p><p>The stranger\'s name was Vorden, he had slick blonde hair and hazel green eyes with a chiseled face and sharp jawline. He also stood 6 foot 2 inches tall while Quinn was 5, 11. This was the type of person Quinn would uselly avoid at his last shool as everyone would always pay them attention and Quinn hated attention.</p><p>\"If you want, I can call someone for help?\" Vorden said.</p><p>\"It\'s okay I\'m just a little bit nervous about the testing,\" Quinn said as he tried to ignore his tired body and stand up straight.</p><p>Vorden looked Quinn up and down. Quinn was quite skinny for his age and didn\'t have a lot of muscle on him and right now he looked incredibly weak. Vorden thought Quinn looked like the type of boy who would have gotten bullied at school and it was the reason why Quinn was nervous.</p><p>If he was to get a level one rating most likely the same would happen here.</p><p>\"Well don\'t be, I\'m quite strong you know. If anyone messes with you, you can come and ask me for Help.\" Vorden smiled.</p><p>Quinn didn\'t usually get on with the energetic positive type of person but Quinn found it hard to dislike Vordan. When Quinn thought about his time back at school, he realized he actually didn\'t get on with anyone.</p><p>\"The names Vordan,\" Vordan said as he placed his hand out.</p><p>Quinn looked at Vordan\'s hand, it was actually the first time in his life someone had treated him this way but Quinn thought that would quickly change. They always did once they found out his Ability level but for once he would like to forget about all that.</p><p>\"My name\'s Quinn,\" Quinn said as he shook Vordan\'s hand.</p><p>&lt;Use of ability has been detected&gt;</p><p>&lt; The ability has been rejected&gt;</p><p>Once the system messages appeared, Quinn looked at them strangely. At the same time, he shook Vordan\'s hand the messages came up instantly. He then noticed that Vordan still hadn\'t let go of his hand. Then the system repeated the message once again.</p><p>&lt;Use of ability had been detected&gt;</p><p>&lt; The ability had been rejected&gt;</p><p>Quinn then immediately let go of Vordan\'s hand. The system was clearly telling him that Vordan was trying to use his ability on him. Vordan himself even had a puzzled look on his face as he stood there still.</p><p>\"You,\" Vordan said. \"What is your ability?\"</p><p>\"I….\" Quinn paused thinking for while whether he should answer or not, in the end, he wanted to see Vordan\'s true reaction. \"I don\'t have an ability.\"</p><p>Vordan no longer had a puzzled look on his face as if the answer had satisfied the curiosity of his but before Vordan could say anything, Griff had made an announcement.</p><p>\"Will the students, Quinn Talen, Vordan Blade, Peter Chuck, Layla Munrow, and Erin Heley please come to the front to take your test.\"</p>'),(189,9,'Chapter 5 No Ability',_binary '<p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 5 No Ability</h3><p></p><p>                          Once the five students had heard their names being called up, each of them started to walk to the front were Griff was standing.</p><p>Including Quinn and Vorden, there was another boy named Peter. Peter looked more nervous than anyone there, he would constantly look around him and couldn\'t stop fidgeting. His body frame was quite small but it suited him, for he wasn\'t that tall either.</p><p>Then there were the two girls Named Layla and Erin. Layla had short brown hair and a tall figure. On her back, she was carrying a bow which surprised Quinn, for not many people carried a weapon these days apart from a specific group of people called Pure.</p><p>They were a group of people who chose to not have any abilities and used weapons instead but they were still very rare and Quinn had never met anyone like that in his life, only heard stories about them.</p><p>Finally, there was Erin. Erin was the type of girl that turned all of the boy\'s heads. Her proportions were perfect, not too big not too small and she had beautiful long blonde hair. The only problem was her facial expressions. Even when walking through the crowds of people, not once did her expression change. It stayed stiff and neutral.</p><p>As Quinn was walking past everyone, he noticed that he didn\'t recognize one student there and it seemed like the others didn\'t either. Quinn could only assume that this was done on purpose. No one knew who to befriend or who to look out for because currently, everyone\'s power level displayed 1.</p><p>The group had stopped just behind another group who were being transported to the testing area. </p><p>As soon as Vorden saw the others who were in the same group, Vordan greeted each one of them with a handshake. Vorden was being very polite so most of them accepted his greetings apart from Erin.</p><p>She merely stared at Vordan\'s hand when he offered it out to her, then she turned her head and looked away.</p><p>\"Come on you don\'t have to be like that?\" Vordan said as he placed his hand on her shoulder.</p><p>This was a big mistake. In an instant, Erin grabbed Vordan\'s wrist and twisted his hand. Then slowly his hand was starting to freeze and cover in ice.</p><p>Everyone stopped to look at the commotion that was happening near the front.</p><p>\"Wow, she has ice abilities?\"</p><p>\"Isn\'t that very Rare?\"</p><p>\"I would let her freeze me any day.\"</p><p>Griff noticed the commotion and started to intervene.</p><p>\"Stop it you two, if you have that much energy then save it for the test.\"</p><p>Erin immediately let go of Vordan\'s hand and slowly, Vordan\'s hand started to defrost. Vordan then went back in line to stand next to Quinn.</p><p>\"Can you believe her!\" Vordan complained, \"I nearly lost my hand.\"</p><p>\"You can\'t just go around touching people without their permission,\" Quinn replied.</p><p>\"Yeah I know, she\'s lucky I didn\'t wipe the floor with her just cause she\'s a pretty girl.\"</p><p>Many people who were near the front had heard Vordan\'s word and had already decided to make him an enemy. If they could somehow humiliate Vordan, then maybe Erin would look the way they thought.</p><p>Looking at the people around them, Quinn could tell what the others were thinking. Quinn then stepped one step away from Vordan hoping that others wouldn\'t think the two were friends.</p><p>Finally, Quinn and the others were called forward and were told to stand in a box. It wasn\'t really a box but just white lines that had been drawn on the ground that was just big enough to fit the five of them in.</p><p>There was then a hooded man who stood just outside of the box.</p><p>\"Send them away!\" Griff said.</p><p>As soon as Griff gave the command, the hooded man placed both hands on the ground and the box started to light up, shining a bright purple color.</p><p>\"Hmm Transportation magic huh, what a rare ability,\" Vordan said Just as the whole group suddenly vanished into thin air.</p><p>The next second they were teleported to another outdoor area which looked like an empty wasteland. There was no sign of life, no trees, no nothing. Standing in front of the group was a woman dressed in a black military uniform and by her side was another hooded man.</p><p>There was not another person in sight. </p><p>The woman held a Tablet in her hand and it looked like she was currently busy inputting some information. Once she had finished, she looked up at the group and started to speak.</p><p>\"Hi everyone my name is Jane, and I will be in charge of your test today. Once the test has been completed, I will update your information and your score will be reflected on your wristwatches.\"</p><p>Jane then started to look at the tablet.</p><p>\"Now who should we call first, oh it looks like we have a couple of previous level ones?\" Jane said as she checked the information that had been passed on from their previous schools.</p><p>\"Peter, would you please step forward?\"</p><p>The nervous small Peter then stepped forward and he looked even worse than before. Quinn thought he looked bad but he looked to be in perfect condition if you were to compare the two. At least Quinn was able to stand up whereas Peter looked like he would fall over any second now.</p><p>\"Would you please tell me what your ability is Peter?\" Jane asked.</p><p>\"Eh, I don\'t have any ability,\" Peter said quietly.</p><p>Suddenly, Quinn and the others understood why Peter was so nervous. Having no ability wasn\'t rare. Because of the war, many children had become orphans like Quinn and Peter. This meant there was no chance for them to buy an ability book.</p><p>But because Peter had no ability, he was afraid of the treatment he would get from the others.</p><p>\"Don\'t be afraid Peter.\" Jane said, \"Here take this.\"</p><p>The hooded man standing by Jane\'s side suddenly teleported a book into his hand. Jane then handed the book over to Peter.</p><p>\"Wow, seriously you\'re giving this to me for free!\" Peter said in excitement. \"Thank you.\"</p><p>\"Please study the book in your own free time and when you have learned to use it, you can come back to redo the test but for now I\'m going to have to award you a level 1 power status.\"</p><p>Even though Peter had received a level 1 power status he didn\'t care, for he felt like his life could finally turn around due to the book that he had just received.</p><p>\"Now I believe there was another level 1 user here,\" Jane said, \"Quinn is it? would you please step forward.\"</p><p>Quinn did as he was told and stepped forward. </p><p>\"Now Quinn, what ability do you have?\"</p>'),(190,9,'Chapter 6 Resul',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 6 Resul</h3><p></p><p>                          Quinn thought the whole thing was ridiculous. It was quite clear to him that Jane already had all the information on him from his previous school. They knew that he never had an ability before, the problem was Quinn was struggling with deciding what to do. </p><p>Before coming to military school Quinn had done a bit of research himself. He knew that the military gave all students who had no ability an ability book. Each ability book given was the same one. It was an Earth ability book.</p><p>The reason they did this was so students who didn\'t have an ability before, would suddenly feel indebted to the military. Not only that but the military also had a hold on nearly all of the Earth type ability books. Meaning if you ever wanted to increase your strength, you would have to be loyal to the military, and in return, they would give you more power.</p><p>Before Quinn had discovered his own Ability, he actually thought this was the best option for him. Even if he didn\'t want to join the military after two years, the Earth ability was handy to have. It was easy for employment because the Earth ability was useful in construction.</p><p>This was where the problem came in, Quinn already having an ability meant he was unable to learn a new one. The ability book was practically useless. Not only that but Quinn was pretty sure they would keep tabs on every student they had given the ability book to, meaning the teachers would accept him to use earth powers the next time they saw him.</p><p>Quinn took a deep breath and said.</p><p>\"I don\'t have an ability.\"</p><p>Just like before the hooded man standing by her side handed her a book and then handed it to Quinn.</p><p>Quinn took the book off Jane at first but then suddenly, a notification screen appeared.</p><p>\\u003cUnable to learn this ability\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cWould you like to convert the book into 10 Exp?\\u003e</p><p>Quinn had somewhat expected the system to display the first message but the second one truly had surprised him. Quinn was really tempted to take the book and use it as a form of Exp but he knew there would be questions asked later on.</p><p>\"I\'m sorry but I don\'t want it,\" Quinn said as he handed the book back to Jane.</p><p>The students watching and the instructor stood there were both shocked. Jane hadn\'t experienced anything like this before. In her five years working as an instructor, it was the first time someone with no ability had rejected the book.</p><p>\"Please give me one moment.\" Jane then stood away from the group of students far enough so they wouldn\'t be able to hear anything.</p><p>\"Yes, Yes, he says he doesn\'t want the ability book what shall I do?\" Jane said speaking on her earpiece.</p><p>\"let him take the test.\" The mysterious man on the phone said.</p><p>As the man hung up, he couldn\'t help but think that Quinn was an interesting student. He started to look at Quinn\'s file and what he had said seemed to be true. The student had no ability and didn\'t seem to have any relations with the group Pure.</p><p>\"Let\'s see how long you can survive in this cruel world Quinn.\" The man said.</p><p>Back at the testing field, Jane had finished the call with her superior and started to head back over to the group.</p><p>\"Sorry for waiting, \"Jane said. \"Since you won\'t be taking the ability book, we will still require you to take the test please.\"</p><p>Quinn thought the whole thing was a joke. If Quinn truly had no ability then they already knew what the test results were going to be. Was there really a need for him to take the test. If felt like the only reason they wanted Quinn to continue was to make himself feel humiliated and small. Eventually, then he would choose to go to the military and beg for the ability book they were handing out.</p><p>\"Please follow me.\"</p><p>Jane then took Quinn a little further out onto the field where Quinn noticed that there were huge craters in the ground, burn marks, and all sorts of things. This was all done from the previous testing contestants.</p><p>\"Please proceed to destroy the targets in front of you as quick as you can.\" Jane said, \" the test will begin immediately.\"</p><p>As soon as Jane finished talking, three targets popped up around randomly around the wasteland. They were metal round targets with a red dot in the center. </p><p> The problem was when Quinn tried to look for the targets, everything seemed like a blur in the distance. Quinn then realized that his perfect eyesight, suddenly wasn\'t so perfect.</p><p>\"Is this because I\'m out in the sunlight?\" Quinn thought.</p><p>Quinn had no choice but to slowly run-up to each of the targets and hit them with his fist one by one, his time was incredibly slow of course.</p><p>There were then two further tests that Quinn needed to complete. The next test was a strength test were Quinn was asked to punch into a huge drum-like machine. Quinn gave it his best shot and hit the drum as hard as he could. The drum vibrated and made a small sound eventually displaying a digital number in the center. </p><p>\"5, strength,\" Jane said as she noted it down on her tablet.</p><p>When the final test had arrived they had brought out another machine. This machine was a big circular object with many holes on its front. Once the test started the machine fired holographic spikes at the contestants. All Quinn needed to do was avoid being hit by the spikes.</p><p>The machine went up in levels and eventually got faster and shot out more spikes, in the end, Quinn managed to get hit and the test was stopped.</p><p>\"Agility, 5\" Jane said once again as she noted it down on her tablet</p><p>Quinn had heard the words from Jane\'s mouth and it started to make him think if there was some sought a link to the score she had given him. The last test was a test of strength and Quinn had scored a 5, similar to his system which had stated he had 5 strength. Then once again this test focused on agility and scored a 5 which was the same as his system.</p><p>This meant if Quinn was to take the test at night all of his scores would have most likely doubled. This also meant as long as he leveled up he could always increase his score it was as if his ability was the ability to evolve but had some drawbacks with it as well.</p><p>\"As expected.\" Jane said, \"Unfortunately your current power level is a level 1.\"</p><p>Quinn clenched his fist and went back to stand with the others. He knew that the days ahead of him as a level 1 user would be tough but that wouldn\'t be for much longer.</p><p><br/></p>'),(191,9,'Chapter 7 Same Ability',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 7 Same Ability</h3><p></p><p>                          The Test continued with Layla taking the text next. She was the only one there who had a weapon on her back. The weapon she used was a bow but it didn\'t look like a regular bow that people used to use a long time ago.</p><p>This bow was carved using parts of a beast. It was black in color and looked almost as if the entire bow was made of gems. Even the string was made of a special material. The reason the bow looked so different, was because it was what was known as a beast weapon.</p><p>A bow made from the body parts of a beast. When the human race was attacked by the Dalki, our technology advanced fast by replicating their technology, with this, the humans learned the ability to travel to other planets using portals.</p><p>These planets would often contain different levels of beasts. The stronger the beast was the better weapon you could make out of it. It was the first time Quinn had ever witnessed a beast weapon before as no one at his previous school had one.</p><p>It was strange to see someone of such a young age who has most likely never been to another planet, to have a beast weapon.</p><p>Layla stood in the centre of the field and waited for the test to start. Unlike when it was Quinn\'s turn, they waited until she was ready before starting. Quinn could already start to see a difference in treatment.</p><p>When the test started, 5 targets all appeared in different areas of the wasteland. Layla immediately took out 5 arrows and placed them in her bow, shooting them all off at once in the same direction.</p><p>The arrows shot out fast and strong but then suddenly, the five arrows split off into their own direction, each of them heading to a different target.</p><p>\"What a good combo.\" Vorden said, \"She was the ability of telekinesis but it\'s quite weak, so instead she uses her ability combined with the bow to control the arrows.\"</p><p>In an instant, all five of the targets were hit at the same time and she had completed the first test. Quinn for the first time saw how useful beast weapons were. Even if you had a weak ability you could make it strong.</p><p>Quinn wasn\'t completely sure what his ability was yet but even if it just increased his stats as he levelled up, then he thought about how handy something like a beast sword or something similar would be.</p><p>On the strength test, Layla didn\'t do so well. She used her powers to try to move her fist even faster when punching the drum but, in the end, her score was only an 8.</p><p>The last test Quinn also saw her do quite bad. When the test first started, Layla tried to use her ability on the spikes coming at her, unknown to her because they were holograms and not the real thing, it had no effect.</p><p>Meaning all Layla could do was rely on her actual body to avoid the spikes, in the end, Layla ended getting the same score as Quinn.</p><p>\"It looks like you have the ability level of a level 2 User,\" Jane said and immediately the number 2 appeared on Layla\'s wrist.</p><p>Quinn could tell Layla wasn\'t happy, she stropped back as she walked over to the group. Quinn thought the test wasn\'t really fair. Her ability level might be that of a level 2 but when used with a bow Quinn felt like she could have easily beaten some level 3 or 4 users.</p><p>Quinn was starting to take note that the academy really did only measure the power level of your ability and not your fighting ability.</p><p>The next person to take the test was Erin. She walked forward confidently without even looking at anyone else. She stood in the centre of the testing field waiting for the test to start.</p><p>Then, 5 random targets appeared across the wasteland. Immediately she formed an ice spear and chucked it at the target hitting it dead on. She did this one after the other at an incredible speed, nearly clearing them all just as fast as Layla did.</p><p>The next test Erin was even more impressive. She started to gather ice in both her palms and then after a minute or so of gathering her power, a huge ice collum was shot from her hands and hit the centre of the drum dead on. The drum rang out louder than it had before and the number kept going up until it had eventually reached 50.</p><p>\"No wonder she\'s so confident, \"Vorden said.</p><p>Quinn suddenly thought it was a good thing the two of them didn\'t fight otherwise Vordan would have been a dead man.</p><p>Finally, when the last test had arrived the instructor told her she wasn\'t allowed to use her ability and should just dodge. Erin had no reaction and started the test immediately. She managed to do well moving swiftly avoiding each spike but eventually, the machine had gotten too fast and she ended up getting hit.</p><p>\"Impressive!\" Jane said, \"best result so far, power level 5.\"</p><p>Erin continued to walk back to her group as if she knew what she was going to get all along, either that or she didn\'t really care about the whole thing.</p><p>Finally, the last person to take the test in the group was Vorden.</p><p>\"Time to show you what I got, wish me luck.\"</p><p>Quinn had no clue who Vordan was talking to, but Quinn quickly realized it was him after Vordan gave a wink in his direction as he walked off to the centre of the field.</p><p>\"Could that idiot actually be strong?\" Quinn thought.</p><p>Most of the time people who strong were either arrogant about their powers or kept it quiet but Vorden was a strange person. He wasn\'t exactly arrogant but more flashy.</p><p>When it finally came to his turn and the test had started, everyone\'s mouth was left wide open at what they were seeing. On every single one of the tests, Vorden had done the exact same thing as Erin.</p><p>He had used the same ability, the ability of Ice, and had performed just as well.</p><p>\"See, I told you I was strong!\" Vorden said as he showed the number 5 to his new best friend Quinn.</p><p>Just what was Vorden\'s ability Quinn thought.</p><p><br/></p>'),(192,9,'Chapter 8 Fate',_binary '<p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 8 Fate</h3><p></p><p>After seeing Vorden perform well on the test, Quinn couldn\'t help but think about what Vorden\'s ability was. When Vorden went to shake his hand that time, it said that Vorden had tried to use his ability on Quinn. Yet for some reason, his ability didn\'t work.</p><p>If Vorden\'s ability was ice, surely his hand would have just frozen. That\'s unless Quinn had an ability to block all types of abilities, but that was highly unlikely. Not only that, but straight after, even Vorden had a strange reaction, asking Quinn what his ability was; It was as if he knew his ability didn\'t work.</p><p>Then another thought came into Quinn\'s mind; why was Vorden so adamant on shaking the hands of everyone he had just met? If he remembered correctly, Erin refused to shake Vorden\'s hand, yet in the end, Vorden still went to touch Erin on the shoulder. At that time, it seemed like a weird thing to do, but now Quinn realized it wasn\'t and everything was starting to make sense.</p><p>Touching was the condition, and the last person who Vorden touched was Erin. It couldn\'t be a coincidence that both of them had the same powers, which meant most likely that Vorden\'s ability was the kind to copy other people\'s ability.</p><p>It didn\'t work on Quinn because his ability wasn\'t straight forward. Quinn couldn\'t help his curiosity, so he asked Vorden.</p><p>\"Hey, Vorden is your ability...\" Quinn whispered, \"are you able to copy other people\'s abilities?\"</p><p>Vorden looked at Quinn and smiled.</p><p>\"I\'m surprised you figured it out so fast. How did you figure it out?\"</p><p>\"When you shook my hand, you seemed surprised that nothing happened.\"</p><p>Vorden thought that Quinn was quite amazing, being able to guess something like that just from a handshake. After all, it was much more likely that Vorden had obtained the Ice ability from an ability book. The power for copying wasn\'t available as an ability book, which only meant one thing.</p><p>\"Are you an original?\" Quinn asked.</p><p>Vorden didn\'t say anything but simply gave a wink back at Quinn, which pretty much confirmed Quinn\'s thoughts.</p><p>Vorden was an Original, a person belonging to a family who decided to not share their abilities with the outside world. He is someone who could easily surpass the power level of 8.</p><p>Once the test has been completed, the hooded man teleported the students to the front of the academy where they would be staying. The academy was huge, and it\'s the tallest building in the entire city. It was as if someone had put together three hotels.</p><p>There were ten different teachers in total who were currently standing in front of the academy\'s facade. Tarrying in front of them were the groups of students who all had finished taking the test. The students were told to wait with the teachers until all the students had finished conducting their tests.</p><p>Once in a while, a group of five students would be teleported in front of one of the teachers. Finally, there was now a total of 20 students in the group where Quinn was a part of.</p><p>\"Okay, you all need to follow me as I take you around the school.\" The teacher up front said.</p><p>The teacher was a middle-aged man with blonde curly hair who wore glasses; his name was Del.</p><p>While Del was walking around, describing the various places in the vicinity of the academy, he couldn\'t help but smile. It looked like nothing would be able to upset him.</p><p>\"You guys should start to get to know each other as much as you can,\" Del said. \"After all, the people you are with now will be your classmates.\"</p><p>All of a sudden, everyone started to get chattier, talking to each other as they were being shown around the school. However, there was something that Quinn had noticed. The mid-levels were trying their best to get friendly with the higher levels, while the low levels were completely being ignored.</p><p>Accordingly, Quinn and Peter were the only two level 1\'s in the class. Without realizing it, they had been pushed to the back of the group, and Peter was plodding along with his head held down. It seemed to have affected Peter a lot more than Quinn, but the latter had already suspected that this would happen.</p><p>Although suddenly, a familiar voice was heard calling out Quinn\'s name.</p><p>\"There you are!\" Vorden said. \"Man, people just started jumping all over me. Then all of sudden, I look to my right side, and you\'re gone. Come on! Let\'s look around together, friend.\"</p><p>Quinn truly thought that Vorden was a strange person, yet that wasn\'t a bad thing. Vorden then noticed Peter who was on his own as well.</p><p>\"Come on, stop being a downer and you come over here too.\"</p><p>Peter looked up and pointed a finger to himself.</p><p>\"Who else do you think I\'m talking to?\" Vorden questioned peter.</p><p>The three of them continued to hang at the back of the class while the teacher continued to tour around the school. In the midst of the tour, a battle arena was shown to the students, where they had similar testing equipment to the ones filed on the wasteland, as well as several square fighting platforms.</p><p>They were also shown their homeroom classes, battle classes, sports rooms, and all sorts of facilities. Del never failed to provide a little bit of explanation about each area of the school where they visited, However, Quinn was uninterested in most of them until they had finally reached the library.</p><p>\"As you can all see, the library here is split into three floors. First-year students are only able to access the first floor; meanwhile, the second-year students can access the second floor; finally, the last floor is only for Military personnel.\"</p><p>Quinn was interested in the library because it contained books that weren\'t available to the public. In this place, Quinn just might be able to find some information about his ability, though he just hoped that it would be on the first floor.</p><p>Eventually, the tour came to an end as Del stopped just outside the school\'s dorms.</p><p>\"And this is where you will be living during your stay here. Once you have dropped off your things, feel free to explore around the academy. There will be no lessons today, so you will get to have the rest of the afternoon to explore.\"</p><p>Each student was then handed a number written on a piece of paper. These papers displayed which room they would be staying in.</p><p>Quinn then noticed from the corner of his eye that Vorden was coming towards him.</p><p>\"Hey, Quinn what room number did you get?\" Vorden asked.</p><p>\"Err 23.\"</p><p>\"No way! You\'re kidding, right? I got the same number. Maybe fate is really bringing us together.\" Vorden said excitedly.</p><p>\"Maybe\" Quinn replied.</p><p>On the other hand, somewhere down the hallway, two other students were having a conversation.</p><p>\"Woah! What happened to you?\" A student said as he looked at his friend.</p><p>\"I don\'t know man, some guy just appeared and hit me out of nowhere, forcing me to swap room numbers.\"</p><p>\"Man, should we try to get it back?\" The student asked.</p><p>\"Nah if I saw his wrist correctly, it said he was a level 5. It\'s best if we just leave it\"</p>'),(193,9,'Chapter 9 What system',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 9 What system?</h3><p></p><p>                          After Quinn had finished unpacking, he was free to do what he wanted for the rest of the day. It was still noon so he had plenty of time to explore the academy on do what he wanted.</p><p>Quinn was currently sharing his room with two people and to his surprise, he knew both of them. One of them was Vorden while the other was Peter. There were three single beds in the room each spread out from one another but other than that the room was pretty empty.</p><p>Students were expected to spend most of their time studying or practicing their skills. there was no time for pleasure.</p><p>\"What do you guys want to do then?\" Vorden asked.</p><p>\"I\'m still unpacking, you two don\'t have to wait for me, do what you want,\" Peter replied.</p><p>Peter had opened up a little to the two of them, at first he was completely shy and hardly said a word but slowly Peter seemed to be coming out of his shell especially around Quinn. Peter most likely felt comfortable around Quinn knowing that he was a level 1 ability user like himself.</p><p>\"I was thinking of heading to the library,\" Quinn replied, \"that will probably be too boring for you.\"</p><p>\"Boring, I can make anything fun, besides I haven\'t read a book in…\" Vorden paused for a while. \"I can\'t even remember the last time I read a book.\"</p><p>The three of them laughed and then Vorden and Quinn decided to head to the library together. Finally, they had arrived and the first floor was already busy with students. Quinn noticed that there were multiple round desks spread out where students were sitting and In the middle of the desk was a glowing orb.</p><p>\"Ahh, you\'re probably wondering what that Orb thing is in the middle aren\'t you?\" Vorden asked, \"It looks like they don\'t have them at public schools. If you touch the orb, then it allows you to create a space, in that space, only those people who have been invited can be heard. This way people are able to talk and chat as much as they want while not disturbing others.\"</p><p>\"Technology sure has come a long way.\"</p><p>Quinn and Vorden then chose a table that had two other people sitting on the other side. Just as Vorden had said, Quinn could see the two talking but couldn\'t hear a word of what they were saying. The orb seemed to only have a range of the table though. Once you left the table others were able to hear you as normal.</p><p>Quinn went looking around the library and picked out as many books as he could about abilities. Most of them describing what different types of abilities the world had. Vorden wasn\'t too bothered and decided to just select a random fiction book to read.</p><p>The two sat at their tables while Quinn started to flick away. After reading several books Quinn had discovered nothing new. He already knew about most of the abilities written in the book but not one of them mentioned an ability like Quinn\'s.</p><p>Vorden had been keeping a close eye on Quinn and noticed the type of books he had been picking out.</p><p>\"What\'s with all the books, are you looking for something in particular?\"</p><p>Quinn thought about it for a while before giving Vorden an answer. Vorden wasn\'t the brightest person when it came to academics but he was quite knowledgeable about abilities it seemed. He would have to be because of the type of ability he had.</p><p>\"I was trying to decide what ability to get since I turned down the school\'s offer.\"</p><p>\"Oh right, I forgot about that, I thought you might have been one of those Pure members who hate abilities. Turns out you just didn\'t want to be a dog to the military.\" Vorden replied, \"Well is there anything specific you\'re looking for?\"</p><p> \"Not really, I have no clue. There was one that said something interesting though, have you ever heard of an ability that is weaker in sunlight.\"</p><p>Vorden suddenly started to laugh out loud.</p><p>\"What are you crazy, I\'ve never heard of something like that. Abilities are something our bodies learn. Sure some people have limits and can\'t learn stronger spells or can do less than others but for one to get weaker because of the sun. Sounds like you\'re a Vampire or something.\"</p><p>Quinn felt a little embarrassed by Vorden\'s reaction. Of course, Quinn knew this would be the normal reaction when asking something like this but it was true. As long as Quinn was in direct sunlight all of his stats would weaken by half.</p><p>Quinn continued to look around the library to see if there was anything else he could find. He had finally gone through every single one of the ability books he could find but there was nothing. Quinn then looked up at the floor above where there were some second-year students.</p><p>\"Maybe there\'s something up there but I can\'t imagine what the academy would do to me for breaking the rules.\" Quinn thought.</p><p>As Quinn continued to walk around the library, he had eventually ventured into the fiction section and his eyes were drawn to something.</p><p>A specific title of a book named \"The Truth about Vampires.\"</p><p>Quinn took out the book and gave it a quick look. Vampires were things of fairy tales, myths even. Even when people started to come out with powers, there was not one person who came out claiming to be a vampire.</p><p>Quinn couldn\'t help himself but start to read the book. It was a long shot but maybe he would find something he could relate to.</p><p>After reading and skimming through the book, Quinn found most of it was useless. A lot of the things that Vampires did, didn\'t relate to him at all. Vampires were required to eat human blood. Some could transform themselves into bats and cast illusions. While others were incredibly skilled with the sword and hypnosis but Quinn had none of these things.</p><p>The only thing he could relate to in the book was being weaker in the sun. Eventually, Quinn decided to close the book and call it a day. It didn\'t seem like he was going to find anything from the first floor of the library.</p><p>As soon as Quinn closed the book though. A familiar sound was heard.</p><p>*Ding</p><p>\\u003cYou gained more knowledge about the system\\u003e</p><p>\\u003c10 exp received\\u003e</p><p>\\u003c15/100 Exp \\u003e</p><p>\"It couldn\'t be, could it?\"</p><p><br/></p>'),(194,9,'Chapter 10 New Ques',_binary '<p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 10 New Ques</h3><p></p><p>Quinn stared long and hard at the message and reread it multiple times.</p><p>\"It couldn\'t be, did I get exp from reading that fantasy book?\"</p><p>Quinn immediately had to test it out, after reading several different books about abilities, not one had given him exp but for some reason this book did. Quinn then immediately picked up another fantasy story, one about dragons this time titled \"Reincarnated into a human?\".</p><p>He did the same as before and skimmed through most of it but made sure to read the crucial parts, then when he closed the book there was no reaction. This of course was expected.</p><p>Then Quinn wanted to test another thing out, he picked up another book that was also about Vampires and did the same. When he closed the book though the same thing happened, the system had no reaction at all.</p><p>In the end, Quinn theorized that after reading all the books, he had gained so much knowledge about abilities that the system had rewarded him for it. That maybe the system had just given a delayed message.</p><p>He couldn\'t believe that the book about Vampires was somehow related to his system. Well, he didn\'t want to believe it.</p><p>When Quinn finished checking things out at the library, he noticed that Vorden had disappeared from the table and was no longer in the library.</p><p>\"Huh, he must have gotten bored and gone somewhere else?\"</p><p>Quinn looked outside the window and noticed the sun was starting to set. He had been in the library for a total of six hours so far and the time had gone flying by. Then when Quinn was just about to leave, he received another message from the system.</p><p>&lt;Daily quest has been completed&gt;</p><p>&lt;Avoid direct sunlight for 8 hours&gt;</p><p>&lt; 5 exp has been awarded &gt;</p><p>&lt;20/100 Exp&gt;</p><p>Quinn had finally completed his second daily quest. The ride from school had taken them around 2 hours and with the time spent indoors and in the library, Quinn was able to complete the task with ease.</p><p>Each time Quinn received an announcement, he got a satisfying feeling seeing the number go up closer to 100. He couldn\'t wait to see what would happen once he had reached the goal. </p><p>His best guess would be a level up. After all, the system even stated that he couldn\'t use his shop feature until he was at least a level 10.</p><p>The only thing Quinn wished for at the moment was a quicker way to level up. With just the two daily quests a day it would take days until Quinn reached level two.</p><p>Right now though there wasn\'t much he could do but go by his everyday life as normal. As Quinn left the library, he decided to head to the battle arena, there was a theory that he wanted to test out.</p><p>But as he was walking through the school hallway, he could see a kid being pushed up against the wall by another student. The boy on the wall looked like he had already been hit a few times and had markings on his face.</p><p>ChapterMid();</p><p>\"So it\'s started already.\" Quinn thought.</p><p>Quinn managed to catch a glimpse of the boy\'s wristwatch and saw that the number on it indicated that it was a 1.2 power level. Quinn was quite surprised at this as the person doing the bullying was quite weak himself which was a rare occurrence.</p><p>The only people he would be able to bully were people who had a power level of one like Quinn or Peter. That\'s when Quinn suddenly realized who was up against the wall. It was in fact peter. Quinn didn\'t recognize him at first because his face was turned the other way.</p><p>Quinn was debating with himself whether or not to get involved in the first place. He hated bullies more than anything. They had ruined his school life and it seemed like soon he would be a target as well.</p><p>Of course, Quinn also wanted to test out his current strength and he had found the perfect guinea pig. The student in front of him was only at a power level of 1.2 so there was a high chance he could win.</p><p>The student lifted his fist again to give peter another punch.</p><p>\"You think you can just bump into me like that and say sorry!\" He shouted as he swung his fist.</p><p>Then as Quinn was walking past, he pretended to fall over and bumped into the student, causing him to fall off balance and miss.</p><p>\"Quinn?\" Peter said as he looked up.</p><p>\"What the hell was that for?\" The student said as he looked at who had just pushed into him.</p><p>The student then immediately looked at Quinn\'s watch and suddenly the confidence in him grew.</p><p>\"What the hell is a level 1 piece of rubbish like you doing?\"</p><p>\"I was waiting to see how long it would take for someone like you to appear. It seems like I lost a bet with myself. I thought it would at least take a couple of days.\"</p><p>\"And what are you going to do about it?\"</p><p>Peter was starting to feel slightly worried about Quinn. He knew at the test site that Quinn had no abilities while the student he was facing did. Peter thought they might stand a chance if the two of them fought together but Peter, in the end, was too afraid.</p><p>He had been hurt his whole life and didn\'t want to be hurt anymore. This was just how the current world worked. The people at the top with the strongest powers bullied the weaker ones and in turn, they bullied the even weaker ones.</p><p>It was the first time the student had ever met someone weaker than him and suddenly all the pain he had experienced, he wanted someone else to feel it too. That way he didn\'t feel like he was at the bottom of the food chain.</p><p>Quinn then noticed that the student had both of his hands held behind his back as if he was preparing something and the next thing that happened confirmed his thoughts.</p><p>&lt;An ability has been detected&gt;</p><p>&lt;Initiating battle mode&gt;</p><p>&lt; New quest has been given &gt;</p><p>&lt;First fight, power level 1.2&gt;</p><p>&lt; Win the fight to gain 50 Exp &gt;</p><p>Suddenly, Quinn had a huge grin on his face. This was how he was going to level up faster.</p>'),(195,9,'Chapter 11 New Skill',_binary '<p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 11 New Skill</h3><p></p><p>The student stood opposite Quinn was still holding his hands suspiciously behind his back. Even without the help of the system, Quinn could tell the student was obviously hiding his ability.</p><p>\"Come on, what happened to your big balls?\" the student said.</p><p>\"I think you\'re playing with them behind your back,\" Quinn replied.</p><p>That immediately angered the student which was what Quinn was going for.</p><p>\"You weak piece of garbage!\" the student came charging forward and slashed his hand out at Quinn.</p><p>Luckily Quinn\'s reflexes were fast and he managed to lift his arm in time to block the attack and move back a little. However, the student\'s hand managed to slice right through the skin of Quinn\'s arm and caused blood to be drawn.</p><p>\"Dam it!\" Quinn said.</p><p>&lt;HP 8/10&gt;</p><p>Quinn looked at the student who now had his hands out in view. The student had a transformation ability that was limited to only his hands. They caused them to slightly resemble a tiger claw and hardened his fingernails.</p><p>Although Quinn was able to block the attack in time, the claw managed to still rip through his skin.</p><p>\"Is the system saying if I take four more attacks like that, I\'m dead?\"</p><p>Suddenly everything became a little bit more serious for Quinn. The stinging pain he was feeling on his arm was real and this was a real fight. The game-like system had caused him to take things a little too easy. But he was quickly reminded that this wasn\'t a game.</p><p>The student then immediately started to charge at Quinn once again with his claw-like hands. As the student swung his right-hand Quinn managed to duck and throw a punch of his own into the student\'s stomach.</p><p>\"What the hell, this guy hits hard!\" The student thought.</p><p>The student didn\'t quit there though and decided to strike at Quinn\'s open back causing another claw mark to appear.</p><p>&lt;HP 6/10&gt;</p><p>\"Shut up I know!\" Quinn shouted as he lifted the student using both of his hands by the legs and threw up against the side of the wall.</p><p>\"How did Quinn manage to pick him up like that?\" Peter thought, \"There roughly about the same size and he threw him with ease, does he really not have an ability?\"</p><p>Quinn didn\'t stop there though. It was important for him to teach people like them a lesson, otherwise, they would just come back for more. Quinn needed to show him to never mess with him again.</p><p>Quinn ran up to the student who was lying and the floor and kicked him in the stomach with full force. The kick was so hard that it caused the student to cough up a little bit of blood from his mouth.</p><p>&lt;Congratulations Quest has been completed&gt;</p><p>&lt;50 Exp Received&gt;</p><p>&lt;70/100 Experience points&gt;</p><p>\"Is he dead?\" Peter asked.</p><p>Then the student suddenly started coughing some more.</p><p>\"No, but if he attacks us again, he\'s going to wish he was.\"</p><p>Quinn was actually quite relieved. He didn\'t know what the punishment was at the academy for killing another student, even if he explained that he hadn\'t attacked first. He also didn\'t want the burden of death on his shoulders at such a young age, so he was happy when the system had rewarded him the experience points, without having the need to kill the student.</p><p>Then suddenly another message had appeared.</p><p>&lt;Additional Quest reward&gt;</p><p>&lt;Skill unlocked: inspect lv1&gt;</p><p>Excitement started to fill Quinn\'s mind as he had finally received his first skill. Quinn was hoping maybe this would help him figure out what type of ability he had but the name of it didn\'t sound too promising.</p><p>\"Inspect? So maybe it can tell me the weaknesses of my opponents?\" Quinn thought.</p><p>Quinn then decided to test his new ability out and looked at Peter who was standing next to him. Now was the next problem. Quinn had no idea how to use his skill but the moment he started thinking about the skill \"Inspect.\" The skill had activated on its own and a screen had appeared right next to Peter.</p><p>&lt;Name: Peter Chuck&gt;</p><p>&lt;Race: Human&gt;</p><p>&lt;Ability: None&gt;</p><p>&lt;HP 3/5&gt;</p><p>&lt;Blood type A+&gt;</p><p>?????</p><p>????</p><p>Quinn looked at the information that had been given to him and it seemed like there were some sections blanked out. Quinn could only assume this was because the level of his skill was still only at level 1 but the information it did give him, was quite handy.</p><p>It told Quinn what type of ability they had which would be very useful in a fight, it also told Quinn how much health they had. However, there was one bit of information that Quinn found strange and that was the Blood type. It was weird for the system to give him information about such a specific thing and Quinn also wondered how on earth would this ever help him in the future.</p><p>Quinn then went up to the Student who was still laying on the ground in pain and used the inspect skill on him.</p><p>&lt;Name: Kyle Main&gt;</p><p>&lt;Race: Human&gt;</p><p>&lt;Ability: Transformation&gt;</p><p>&lt;HP 1/8&gt;</p><p>&lt;Blood type B-&gt;</p><p>Checking the status of Kyle made Quinn learn a few new things. The information he was given about the ability, only gave him the type of ability. There were hundreds of different transformation abilities so it wasn\'t able to pinpoint it.</p><p>The other thing was the HP, It looked like for his victory he only needed to bring down the students HP to 1 but Quinn still didn\'t know if 0 meant death or not. It could also just mean the person had been knocked out.</p><p>Right after inspecting Kyle though, Quinn had received another notification.</p><p>&lt;Optional Quest has been granted&gt;.</p><p>&lt;Drink the blood of your victim to absorb a stat point&gt;</p><p>\"What the, is this thing crazy!\" Quinn thought.</p><p>Even if it gave him a stat point there was no way he was going to drink someone else\'s blood. The very idea of it made Quinn feel sick.</p><p>For a brief moment though Quinn looked to the ground where Kyle had spat out some of his blood.</p><p>\"Maybe a little bit wouldn\'t hurt… Quinn, you\'re going crazy stop it.\"</p><p>\"Come on let\'s go,\" Quinn said to peter.</p><p>The two of them continued to walk down the hallway but while doing so Peter noticed that Quinn kept turning his head to look at Kyle who was still on the floor.</p><p>\"He must be worried about him, Quinn\'s a nice guy after all.\" Peter thought as he smiled.</p><p>But what he didn\'t realize was that Quinn wasn\'t looking at Kyle at all, but was looking at Kyle\'s blood that was on the ground.</p>'),(196,9,'Chapter 12 A second tes',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 12 A second tes</h3><p></p><p>                          As the two continued to walk down the hallway. Quinn started to feel a strange surge through his body.</p><p>\"Hey, shouldn\'t you go to the doctor, I\'m sure they have a healer who can patch that up?\" Peter asked.</p><p>\"Yeah thanks, I\'ll head there now,\" Quinn replied, \"You don\'t have to come with me, it will be a busy day tomorrow so why don\'t you head back to the dorm?\"</p><p>Although Peter was worried about Quinn, Peter didn\'t want to stick in the halls for much longer where other students were able to see him.</p><p>Quinn could see that Peter was hesitating about what to do.</p><p>\"look don\'t worry, Vorden just went to the bathroom he\'ll be back any second so don\'t worry about it.\"</p><p>With that Peter quickly rushed off and headed back to the dorms making sure to cover up his wristwatch most of the time as well. He didn\'t want another incident to happen again.</p><p>Quinn on the other hand, immediately rushed to the nearest boy\'s toilet just down the hall. When he entered the toilet he immediately started to look at his arm were Kyle had scratched it with his claws.</p><p>While looking in the mirror slowly Quinn could see that his arm was healing. Though it looked slow, in reality, it was incredibly fast. For someone to be able to actually witness his skin scabbing over and healing was an amazing sight.</p><p>Quinn had actually felt something strange happening to his body during this process and he noticed it when he was talking to Peter. It was why Quinn was trying to do everything in his power to get Peter to leave him alone.</p><p>If Peter was to see something like this, there was no doubt that Peter would think he had an ability.</p><p>Quinn waited a few minutes and opened up his status screen. It was as he thought, his HP slowly regained as well.</p><p>\\u003cHP 8/10\\u003e</p><p>Eventually, the wound on his arm and back had completely healed up and only the rips in his shirt could be seen.</p><p>\\u003cHP 10/10\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cYour HP had been healed\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cYour hunger has grown\\u003e</p><p>Just when Quinn received the two messages Quinn suddenly started to feel hungry.</p><p>\"Does this mean the system uses food to heal my wounds? It makes sense, the energy has to come from somewhere.\" Quinn thought.</p><p>The pain in Quinn\'s belly was very little. It was as if he had just missed breakfast or something. When Quinn had the chance, he would get a quick bite to eat.</p><p>Before Quinn headed back to the dorms there was one more thing he wanted to do and that was to head to the training room that they had been shown while touring the school.</p><p>It was getting late and the students had an early start in the morning, so most of the students had already returned to their dorms. This meant it was the perfect chance for Quinn to head to the training room without anyone seeing him.</p><p>Quinn had finally reached the training room in the academy. It was a large oval dome-like building with a huge empty space in the middle. At the edges of the room were rows and rows of technological equipment.</p><p>There were giant mech robots, shooting targets, and things Quinn had no idea what they even did but what Quinn wanted to see most of all, was the power level testing equipment. Inside the training centre, Quinn had also spotted the same machinery that was used at the testing field.</p><p>When Quinn entered the room was completely empty of people as he thought.</p><p>Quinn walked over to testing equipment while walking past all the other sorts of machinery and finale he stopped just in front of the drum-like machine. This machine was the same machine that tested the user\'s strength.</p><p>Layla had also come to the training room late at night and before Quinn had entered, she had been testing out her bow and arrow skills, practicing. She always practiced at night when she was nervous and she couldn\'t help but worry about tomorrow.</p><p>That was when she suddenly heard the doors open to the training room, being her shy usual self, she immediately hid behind one of the giant robots. Suddenly she saw the student walk over to her direction then she noticed something.</p><p>\"Isn\'t that the boy that I took the test with? If I remember correctly, he had no ability.\" Layla thought.</p><p>Layla continued to watch Quinn as he approached the large drum.</p><p>\"Here it goes!\" Quinn said as he prepared his fist,</p><p>He swung his fist back and prepared to hit the drum as hard as possible. A number appeared on the drum and the number slowly started to rise until it eventually stopped at 10.</p><p> \"Seems like I was on the mark,\" Quinn said.</p><p>Quinn had a theory after hearing his test scores that his status screen stats also matched the equipment the school used. Although this was only a theory, Quinn wanted to test it out for himself.</p><p>Layla who had been watching from behind one of the robots also noticed Quinn\'s new score.</p><p>\"Ten, didn\'t he get five last time? Was he hiding his ability? That score\'s higher than my score.\"</p><p>Layla was suddenly interested in the mysterious student and continued to watch him.</p><p>Quinn next went to the hologram spike machine. Last time Quinn managed to last ten seconds against the machine before it got too fast for him to dodge the attacks. If his theory was right, he should at least be able to last twenty seconds now that his stats were no longer halved.</p><p>Quinn started the test and when the test eventually ended, he got exactly twenty seconds.</p><p>\"It looks like I was right.\"</p><p>With Quinn having confirmed his results, there was nothing left for him to do but head back to the dorm and wait for the next day to start.</p><p>Meanwhile, Layla who had been watching this whole time had seen everything. She couldn\'t understand why a student would hide his strength in the school. A low power level meant you were a target for others.</p><p>Layla only had one thought while she looked at Quinn. \"Interesting.\"</p><p>She decided from now on she would keep a close eye on Quinn.</p><p><br/></p>'),(197,9,'Chapter 13 School hierarchy',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 13 School hierarchy</h3><p></p><p>                          The next day at 8:00 AM the students were woken up by the sound of an alarm in the dorm rooms. It was the signal for everyone to wake up and get dressed. Once everyone was ready, they were to head down to the canteen together for breakfast.</p><p>When Quinn woke up, he was greeted with a nice surprise from the system.</p><p>\\u003cYou have completed your daily Quest\\u003e</p><p>\\u003c Avoid direct sunlight for 8 hours\\u003e</p><p>\\u003c Reward 5 exp\\u003e</p><p>\\u003c75/100\\u003e</p><p>The daily quest had reset at midnight and Quinn had slept for 8 hours rewarding him with his exp. Quinn was pleased as this meant he would easily be able to gain 5 exp without having to go out of his way.</p><p>Then a rumbling sound came from his belly.</p><p>\"I\'m hungrier than I usually am for some reason, maybe my body really did use up a lot of energy in that fight.\" Quinn thought as he headed down to the canteen.</p><p>The canteen was a large hall but it was quite plain. In fact, while walking around the school Quinn noticed most of the school was plain. Single white walls, no picture frames, or anything, just windows now and again.</p><p>It was the sleek modern clean look that the world had taken. The canteen was then filled with large tables that we\'re able to seat three people on each side of the table. As soon as Quinn entered though he noticed something straight away.</p><p>There were no set seats in the canteen meaning students were free to sit where they liked. This straightaway led to a divide in the school. The low levels sat next to the low levels and the high levels sat with the high levels.</p><p>When Quinn was waiting in line with Peter and Vorden they noticed a student come late into the queue. He walked past most of the students and eventually cut into the line ahead of the others. Not one person said a word and the simple reason was he was a higher power level than them.</p><p>Quinn hated these types of actions but right now there was nothing he could do. Once the three of them got their food they started looking for a place to eat.</p><p>\"Why don\'t we go over there?\" Voden pointed at an empty spot.</p><p>\"Are you sure Vorden?\" Peter asked, \"That\'s a level one area, you don\'t have to sit with us if you don\'t want to, right Quinn?\"</p><p>\"Yeah don\'t force yourself,\" Quinn replied.</p><p>\"Quit talking nonsense you two, we\'re friends, I don\'t care about this stupid power level hierarchy going on.\"</p><p>The three of them then went to sit down with the other lower levels on a table. The area slowly started to fill up but not one other person had decided to sit on their table. There was a simple reason for this, they were scared of Vorden.</p><p>They could see his high-power level and the other low levels wanted to stay away.</p><p>As soon as the food was put on the table Quinn started to dig in straight away eating everything that was given to him, even the bits he usually didn\'t like.</p><p>\"Hey if you\'re not going to finish that do you mind if I take it,\" Quinn asked.</p><p>\"Sure, go ahead,\" Peter said.</p><p>Quinn not only ate all of his food but also everything the other two had left behind as well. Not only that but Quinn had grabbed 8 bottles of water as he wanted to finish his quest as soon as possible.</p><p>He noticed last time when he was in the sun, he sweated more than usual and thanks to the water he drank beforehand, he didn\'t feel as dehydrated. If they were to go outside again then this would be a big help to Quinn.</p><p>\"For a skinny guy, you sure did pack down all that food,\" Vorden said.</p><p>Although Quinn had clearly eaten a lot, for some reason he still had a little bit of hunger that wouldn\'t quite go away. Luckily it was bearable and didn\'t distract him too much.</p><p>\\u003cA daily quest has been complete: Drink two liters of water.\\u003e</p><p>\\u003c Reward 5 exp \\u003e</p><p>\\u003c80/100\\u003e</p><p>Quinn was now only 20 points away from levelling up and he would soon see what benefits that brought him.

For some reason, the system was stating that Vorden had no ability.</p><p>\"Hey, Vorden can you still use Erin\'s ice powers at the moment?\"</p><p>\"Wow, I didn\'t know you were so interested in me,\" Vorden said as he rubbed the back of his head. \"Actually, my ability resets every day and I haven\'t touched anyone today. Besides you two of course but you two are duds for my ability.\"</p><p>With breakfast over, it was time for them to head to class. On the way there in the middle of the hallway Peter and Quinn managed to spot Kyle. Kyle looked like he was in top condition and had completely healed.</p><p>As he walked past though he made sure to avoid eye contact.</p><p>\"Do you think he\'ll tell the teacher what happened?\" Peter whispered.</p><p>\"No I doubt it, it\'s embarrassing for him to admit he was defeated by someone weaker then him, plus it will only make him a target if people find out.\"</p><p>It was time for the first class of the day and they needed to head to their tutor rooms together. Their teacher for the day was Del who was the same person who had shown them around the school.</p><p>The students took their seats and just like in the canteen people chose to sit next to those with the same power levels, all but Vorden of course. Vorden decided to sit at the back of the class with the level ones and twos and also chose to sit in between peter and Quinn.</p><p>Immediately the other students started to talk.</p><p>\"What does he think he\'s doing sitting with those bottom feeders.\"</p><p>\"I saw he sat with them in the canteen as well.\"</p><p>\"Won\'t this cause a problem for the hierarchy at school, won\'t the second-year students start to do something?\"</p><p>\"Yeah if he keeps breaking the rules, then they will defiantly step in.\"</p><p>The difference in treatment wasn\'t just a school thing, it was a society thing as well. The higher power level you had the better job and more pay you could earn. The more support you would get from the government while the rest were forgotten about.</p><p>The ones at the top didn\'t have a problem with this of course. The lower power levels would do anything they asked just to obtain a new skill from them hoping one day they could increase their power level and anyone who tried to upset this, where quickly silenced.</p><p>It was the whole reason why the Pure group existed in the first place. To fight against this system and it was also why they were treated like terrorists.</p><p>Del started his lecture which was about the introduction fo the school and the great war.</p><p>\"When we were losing the great war against the Dalki race that was when they had come forward. We call them the Originals. This was the first time the whole world had been introduced to abilities. Unknown to all of us they had kept these abilities for themselves for hundreds of years only passing it down to their family members.</p><p>Thanks to them they shared their abilities with others of the human race but not all of them of course. When we talk about an Original we are either talking about the founders of the ability or a group that decided to not share its abilities to the rest of the world.\"</p><p>Del then suddenly had a serious look on his face.</p><p>\"Although we are currently in a time of piece who knows when the war will start again and that is why you are here.\"</p><p>Once the class had finished it was time for the students to take a break. Vorden, Quinn, and Peter headed outside to grab a snack. As soon as Quinn stepped outside though the usual message had appeared.</p><p>\\u003cAll stats have been halved.\\u003e</p><p>The three of them sat by a nearby bench and Quinn once again felt weak.</p><p>\"Hey are you alright, you look sick again?\" Vorden asked, \"And your sweating like crazy.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, I just get hot easily,\" Quinn replied.</p><p>The three of them continued to talk about useless things and the experiences they had at school, until suddenly a group of six male students appeared in front of them. Each of them wearing a black arm badge indicating that they were second-year students.</p><p>\"Looks like the rumours were true.\" One of the second-year students said.</p><p>\"We have some business to discuss with you three, do you mind coming with us?\"</p><p><br/></p>'),(198,9,'Chapter 14 Unwritten rules',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 14 Unwritten rules</h3><p></p><p>                          Quinn, Peter, and Vorden were being escorted by the second-year students to a separate part of the school. The school was split into different sections and the second-year building was separate from the first years. This meant the second-year students didn\'t really interact with the first-year students.</p><p>\"Shouldn\'t we just run?\" Whispered Peter.</p><p>\"It might just make the situation worse, if they were going to do something to us they would have waited until we were on our own.\" Quinn replied, \"It seems like they did this in public intentionally, as if to make a statement to all the other low levels.\"</p><p>After walking for a while longer they had eventually arrived at their destination. It was down one of the sides of the second-year buildings, there were a few second-year students who were walking past but the place was relatively quiet.</p><p>Sitting down just outside of the building on the staircase, was a tall man with brown hair wrapped in a ponytail.</p><p>\"We brought them here as you have asked Mono.\" One of the second-year students said.</p><p>\"You guys can leave,\" Mono replied as he stood up from the staircase.</p><p>The second-year students did as they were told and quickly left them to be on their own.</p><p>\"It seems there have been rumours going around of a high tier student hanging around with a bunch of low tier students.\"</p><p>Quinn then noticed Mono\'s wristwatch which had the number 6 written on it.</p><p>\"Is it against the rules?\" Vorden asked.</p><p>Mono started to laugh.</p><p>\"Not quite but there are some unwritten rules of the academy.\" Mono then walked over to Quinn. \"You see the moment you start treating this trash like they are useful to society, they start to get a big head.\"</p><p>Now that Mono was close enough to Quinn, Quinn was able to use his Inspect skill but when he tired casting it the status screen that appeared was blurry, it looked like the status screen itself was melting and all the information was unreadable.</p><p> \"Is it because I\'m out in the sun?\" Quinn thought.</p><p>\"Look at this scum.\" Mono said, \"I\'m only a few feet away from him and there isn\'t even an ounce of fear in his eyes. You know I\'m happy that the war started because it got rid of people like you and only the strong survived.\"</p><p>Quinn\'s blood started to boil, he hated the war and how it had taken everything away from him including his parents. He no longer cared if he was going to take a beating or not, all he wanted to do was punch Mono in the face right there and then.</p><p>At this distance even if Quinn\'s punch was slow it should still hit. Quinn couldn\'t hold in his anger any longer and threw out a punch but before Quinn\'s punch was even thrown out fully, Mono had already taken a step back causing Quinn\'s fist to hit the air.</p><p>Vorden then took this chance to grab onto Mono. However, once again Mono had moved before Quinn had even started his action, causing Vorden to grab nothing.</p><p>\"You think I\'m going to let someone touch me who\'s ability I don\'t even know,\" Mono said. \"I didn\'t come here to fight you guys, today was just a warning, there are some people in this school that not even the military can touch and if you continue acting this way, they will get involved.\"</p><p>With that, Mono headed back up the stairs and into the second-year building.</p><p>\"Do you think he\'s serious?\" Peter asked, \"I know at school they didn\'t like this type of stuff but it seems even worse now that we\'re in a military school, why don\'t the teachers do something to stop it.\"</p><p>\"Because it works in their favour.\" Quinn replied, \"The strong bullying the weak causes the weak to go on the path to find more power, but if you were weak to begin with and don\'t have the family backing to help you, where would you go to get this power?\"</p><p>\"The military,\" Vorden answered.</p><p>\"Exactly, the teachers and the school don\'t do anything because it benefits them. After experiencing hell for two years your mind will have been broken down. You would do anything to seek power and protection and the military can offer that for you.\" Quinn said.</p><p>Quinn then looked at Vorden.</p><p>\"it might be best if we comply with their wishes and go our separate ways for now.\"</p><p>\"Why should I listen to them!\" Vorden snapped back.</p><p>The outburst surprised Quinn as Vorden was strangely against his suggestion.</p><p>\"Look, I understand Vorden that you might think you are helping me and Peter but maybe you don\'t understand because you\'ve never been powerless like us. When we break their rules they won\'t go for you, it will be me and Peter they will go for.\"</p><p>Quinn hated to saying this to Vorden, after all, Vorden was the first person who has a high-power level who didn\'t discriminate between people and so far Vorden\'s presence had helped. Whenever Quinn and Peter walked around the higher levels did nothing to them because of Vorden.</p><p>But this had only attracted bigger fish, something that Vorden and Quinn couldn\'t handle, at least, not yet anyway.</p><p>\"Fine, have it your way!\" Vorden said with anger as he stormed off back to the dorm building.</p><p>\"Maybe we should have explained it to him better,\" Peter said.</p><p>\"No, it\'s fine it\'s better this way,\" Quinn replied.</p><p>Although it looked like Vorden had stormed off in anger due to Quinn\'s words, that wasn\'t true at all. Vorden was angry at the whole situation at the school. Even here it seemed like people were telling him how he should live his life, who he could, and who he could not hang out with.</p><p>Vorden also didn\'t want Quinn to get hurt so he knew it was the right choice, but Vorden wasn\'t going to just let these people get away with trying to control his life. Vorden was going to go after them all.</p><p><br/></p>'),(199,9,'Chapter 15 Finding my next targe',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 15 Finding my next targe</h3><p></p><p>                          Layla had been tracking Quinn and the others for a while now, she was even there when Quinn was busy dealing with Mono. Although she didn\'t plan to help out or anything, she was just amazed that Quinn was able to attract so much attention in one day.</p><p>The only thing that Layla was confused about was why did Quinn\'s punch seem so weak and slow. From the looks of things, it seemed like Quinn really did want to punch Mono but that defiantly wasn\'t his best from what she had seen at the training centre.</p><p>After Vorden had stormed off, Peter and Quinn decided that it would be best that they head back to class for their next lesson. They walked for a while but just before they got back to the first-year building, a group of first-year students were standing in front of the staircase.</p><p>There were three of them in total and on their wrist watch they had a power level between 2 and 2.5.</p><p>\"What are we going to do, Dan asked for 50 credits by the end of this week.\" One of the boys said.</p><p>\"I know, why did they have to pick on us, just cause we\'re weaker than him.\" Another boy replied.</p><p>Credits were the School\'s and city\'s currency system. Even though they were at military school, the rest of the city functioned as normal. There were still restaurants and shops and even fun activities and games to play all around the city. If you wanted to do these things you would have to pay with credits.</p><p>Students received free food while at the school but they also received a daily amount of ten credits that would be sent to their wristwatch. The students were able to get more credits by performing well on missions, school activities, and rewards.</p><p>Peter and Quinn continued to walk past the boys to head the class, that\'s when one of the boys called out to them.</p><p>\"Wait, stop right there you two!\" the boy shouted.</p><p>Peter stopped immediately while Quinn carried on walking.</p><p>\"Hey, are you listening I said stop.\" The boy said, then another boy immediately got in front of Quinn and pushed him back to where Peter was standing.</p><p>Quinn was hoping another incident wouldn\'t occur at least while out in the sun. If he got inside the building just in time then he thought he would have had a fighting chance.  </p><p>\"I think I might have just solved our credits problem; you must be the only level ones in this whole school.\" The boy said. \"Hand over 10 credits each and you can go inside.\"</p><p>\"But that\'s all the credits we have,\" Peter complained.</p><p>\"look I don\'t want to do this but if I don\'t, then my arse gets beat. Hand over the credits now.\"</p><p>Peter looked at Quinn with hope in his eyes, perhaps thinking that Quinn might have been able to do something like last time but after trying to hit Mono, he knew he would have no chance. Besides, these were level twos even at full strength he might not be able to beat them.</p><p>Quinn decided that it would be better off to just hand over the credits anyway. It was better than losing a fight and forcing the credits over.</p><p>Just then Quinn received another system message.</p><p>\\u003c A New quest has been given \\u003e</p><p>\\u003c A Power level difference of 2 has been detected\\u003e</p><p>\\u003c Additional exp will be awarded\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cDefeat the student known as Rylee\\u003e</p><p>Suddenly, Quinn wanted to test out his chances. The idea of gaining additional exp and levelling up even further became really attractive to him but Quinn wouldn\'t let his greed win him over. Right now there were three level 2 power users but the system had only asked him to defeat one of them.</p><p>The first thing Quinn needed to do was get inside so he could use his inspect skill and find out which one was named Rylee. Right now if Quinn used it outside it would only appear as a blur.</p><p>In the end, Quinn decided to hand over the ten credits, He placed his watch on the other boys and the credits were transferred over. Peter ended up doing the same and the two of them were allowed to enter the building.</p><p>\"Hey that was a great idea man!\" one of the boys said, \"Should we just stay out here until we find someone weaker again.\"</p><p>\"What!\" Quinn said in his head, he was hoping that once they had paid them, the boys would enter the building but it looked like they were going to hang outside for a while. Quinn suddenly stopped and waited.</p><p>\"What are you two doing, scram unless you want an ass-kicking!\" A boy said.</p><p>Then Quinn clenched his fist and shouted.</p><p>\"Rylee!\"</p><p>All three boys turned their heads at the same time but not one of them replied. Quinn bad luck continued but he had one more plan to find out which one of them was Rylee.</p><p>\"If you pull this sort of thing again on me Rylee, your dead!\" Quinn said.</p><p>Suddenly the boy stood in the centre of the three with red hair got up and shouted.</p><p>\"What the hell did you say to me you little punk?\"</p><p>\"Run!\" run Quinn shouted.</p><p>Like a bolt of lightning, Peter and Quinn ran as fast as they could to their next class.</p><p>\"What did you do that for?\" Peter asked.</p><p>\"I just wanted to annoy them a little.\"</p><p>Peter couldn\'t help but think Quinn was a little mad but he liked the fact that Quinn didn\'t seem to take crap from people stronger than him and kind of looked up to him a little.</p><p>Once they were just outside their class Quinn opened up his status screen to check if the Quest was still active.</p><p>\"Good.\" Even though Quinn was now away from Rylee, it seemed like the quest was still active and Quinn would get the exp as long as he completed it at any time.</p><p>And Now he knew which one was Rylee and who his first target would be.</p><p>\"You\'re going to help me level up.\"</p><p><br/></p>'),(200,9,'Chapter 16 A new look',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 16 A new look</h3><p></p><p>                          Classes for the day had finally finished, since it was the first day most of the classes were just introductions and about what they would learn during their time at the school.</p><p>Peter and Quinn did their best to avoid most of the other students for the day and it seemed like after everything they had been through, they weren\'t going to get into any more trouble.</p><p>Once classes had finished it was time to go for dinner. Quinn still had this hunger in his stomach so he was looking forward to dinner more than usual. This time, Quinn and Peter both sat on their own at a table in the low-level area. Then Peter started to look around the room as if he was trying to spot someone.</p><p>\"I don\'t see Vorden anywhere, do you think he\'s okay?\" Peter asked.</p><p>Quinn then scouted around the room and he too couldn\'t see Vorden at the canteen.</p><p>\"I wouldn\'t worry about it too much, trust me when I say this but he is a lot safer than us at this school.\"</p><p>The two continued to eat and once they had finished dinner decided to head back to their dorm room. To their surprise, Vorden was already in the dorm room on his own lying on his bed.</p><p>When the two of them closed the door behind them, Vorden lifted his head and immediately smiled at Peter and Quinn.</p><p>\"Hey, I\'ve been waiting for you two for a while now,\" Vorden said as he got off the bed. \"I wanted to say sorry about earlier, I wasn\'t angry at you guys but just at this whole situation.\"</p><p>When Vorden got up from the bed, Quinn noticed a slight mark on the side of Vorden\'s face. It was a little red and a little swollen.</p><p>\"What happened to your face?\" Peter asked.</p><p>\"Oh, this?\" Vorden said as he touched the marking. \"I got into a little scuffle of my own but don\'t worry I didn\'t lose. You don\'t have to worry about me I\'m strong.\"</p><p>Then suddenly, a loud growling noise was heard in the room. Peter and Vorden immediately looked at Quinn whose face had gone bright red.</p><p>\"Sorry, I guess I\'m still hungry after dinner,\" Quinn said laughing nervously.</p><p>\"Why don\'t you grab something from the convenience store, it\'s not too far away?\" Vorden said.</p><p>Quinn looked at his watch and realized even if he did go to the convenience store to grab something, he wouldn\'t be able to buy anything in the first place since he had no credits but before he could even say anything, Vorden had come over and tapped his watch against Quinn\'s.</p><p>\"Transfer of ten credits successful\" The notification sounded.</p><p>\"Don\'t even say anything and go grab something,\" Vorden said with a smile.</p><p>\"Thanks.\"</p><p>With that Quinn left Peter and Vorden on their own while Quinn rushed off to the convenience store. The convenience store wasn\'t too far away from military school. If you walked out, it would take you around 20 minutes.</p><p>At the front of the school was a huge gate that had two guards stood at the entrance at all times, only students, teachers, and certain military personal were allowed on the school grounds. So when you exited students were required to show their wristwatch to the guard and same upon entering again.</p><p>Once past the gates, Quinn decided to test out how much ten stamina points really was. He started to jog at a relatively fast pace to the convenience store. After running for about 5 minutes he realized that he wasn\'t out of breath or anything like he usually would be.</p><p>He decided to run even faster eventually making it to the convenience store in 7 minutes.</p><p>\"I think I was doing about a kilometre in under five minutes, and I\'m not even out of breath.\" Quinn thought.</p><p>The stats given to him were that of an athlete\'s body, it wasn\'t the same weak body he had before but at the same time, it wasn\'t a supernatural body that surpassed human limits.</p><p>Another thing he noticed while running at night, he could see everything super clear. Even when there were no street lights, it was as if the moon had lightened everything up. A type of night vision of sorts.</p><p>\\u003c Your hunger grows slightly \\u003e</p><p>\"I know, I don\'t need the system to tell me when I\'m hungry.\"</p><p>When Quinn entered the convenience store he went and grabbed a few of his favourite snacks. Some late-night ice cream and potato chips. That\'s when he suddenly spotted Rylee and his friends in the same store down another aisle.</p><p>Quinn ducked down quietly and waited for them to finish shopping before doing anything else.</p><p>\"What luck, I thought I would have to track him down but it seems like he\'s come right to me.\"</p><p>While Quinn was hiding, he noticed he was in the middle of the masks section. There was one particular mask that stood out to him. It was a fully black mask that covered the top half of the face so the mouth could be seen. Across the mask was blood splatter on it.</p><p>\"Kinda spooky looking.\"</p><p>Once Rylee and the others had left the store, Quinn decided to grab the mask and snacks and placed them on the counter.</p><p>Layla who was also in the store noticed the mask that Quinn had bought.</p><p>\"What the, it\'s not Halloween yet, what is he doing buying a mask like that?\" she thought.</p><p>Layla decided to continue to follow Quinn while Quinn was busy following Rylee and his friends.</p><p>\"Hey, we\'re going to shoot some hoops in the park, you want to join?\" One of the boys asked.</p><p>\"Nah, you know my ability useless for playing games like that.\" Rylee replied, \"I think ill just head back and wait by the school gate, see if there are any more suckers I can leach some credits from.\"</p><p>The other two boys looked at each other, they knew what they were doing was wrong but were only doing it because they themselves didn\'t want to get beaten up by a higher power level. Where it seemed like Rylee was starting to get a little pleasure from bullying those weaker than him.</p><p>Rylee started to head back to school and eventually reached a small park on the way back. An area that was completely void of people and had very little lights. There were also plenty of trees for Quinn to hide himself.</p><p>\"It\'s showtime,\" Quinn said as he put the mask on his face.</p><p><br/></p>'),(201,9,'Chapter 17 Level up',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 17 Level up</h3><p></p><p>                          Quinn continued to follow Rylee into the forest until he had eventually reached the park. It was mostly dark outside and the only visible light in the area was coming from either the moon or the single street lamp.</p><p>After checking if there were any people nearby, Quinn decided it was time to act and put on his mask.</p><p>\"Even if he spots me now, he won\'t know who to come back to for revenge.\"</p><p>Rylee was currently going through the information on his watch, the glowing light displayed he had a total of 80 credits.</p><p>\"I\'m a genius, I don\'t know why I didn\'t do this sooner.\" Rylee said, \"I have more than enough to pay Dan and keep some for myself, as long as I stay on Dan\'s good side, no one will try to attack me.\"</p><p>As soon as Rylee finished his thought, he felt a large impact on his right side. </p><p>Just then Quinn had come out from the trees and threw out a kick causing Rylee to stumble to the ground. When Rylee looked up all he could see was a student wearing a horrifying mask, with a blood splat on the front.</p><p>\"What the heck, who are you?\" Rylee shouted.</p><p>Of course, Quinn wasn\'t going to answer and wanted to finish the fight fast. He ran up to Rylee and threw another kick, this time though Rylee was prepared and lifted his hands manging to block the kick.</p><p>When Quinn\'s legs hit Rylee\'s hands though, it felt like he was kicking against solid rock.</p><p>\"OUCH!\" Quinn said as he quickly leapt backward to check on his leg.</p><p>He lifted his trousers and saw his leg was badly hurt, it looked like his bones had even bent in slightly.</p><p>\"What?\" Rylee thought as he saw his attacker fall back. Then Rylee spotted his attacker\'s wristwatch, which lit up brightly in the dark and displayed the number one.</p><p>Rylee started to laugh.</p><p>\"I see now, you\'re probably one of the students I took the credits from earlier, And I\'m guessing you thought you could get some revenge.\"</p><p>Quinn then quickly used his inspect skill on his opponent.</p><p>\\u003cHP 8/10\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cRace: Human\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cAbilty: Hardening\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cBlood type: B+\\u003e</p><p>\"Damn it, no wonder my leg felt like it hit a rock.\"</p><p>Although Quinn\'s surprise attack didn\'t work, he still felt like he could win this fight.</p><p>Quinn charged in once again this time throwing a fist. The attack was faster than Rylee had expected and he didn\'t have time to use his hardening skill and he took the blow right in the face.</p><p> \"I think he cracked my tooth, how hard does this kid hit?\" Rylee thought.</p><p>Quinn threw another punch with his other hand but Rylee had predicted this and hardened his face in time. When Quinn\'s fist hit Rylee\'s face, once again it felt like he was hitting a rock.</p><p>\\u003c Your fist is broken \\u003e</p><p>\\u003c 7/10 HP \\u003e</p><p>Quinn then stepped back causing distance between the two.</p><p>\"Again, what am I meant to do if he keeps hardening his body?\"</p><p>Then a thought came into Quinn\'s mind. If Rylee was able to harden his body then why didn\'t he just keep it hardened all the time? If he did then Quinn\'s first attack wouldn\'t have gone through.</p><p>Did this mean that Rylee was only able to Harden a single part of his body at a time? It was just a theory but Quinn had nothing to lose and this gave him a plan.</p><p>Quinn Ran forward at Rylee one more time shouting.</p><p>\"I\'m going to punch that ugly face of yours if it\'s the last thing I do!\"</p><p>Rylee then hardened his face again and was ready this time but at the last second Quinn changed his punch to a kick in the stomach, causing Rylee to bend over.</p><p>\"It worked.\"</p><p>Then Quinn went to knee Rylee in the stomach again but at the last second stopped and punched Rylee on the back of the head. Now Rylee laid on the ground defenceless.

He couldn\'t believe what he was reading right now. After seeing that last message there was only one thing that came into his head.</p><p>\"I\'m a Vampire?\"</p><p>Maybe Quinn was just trying to avoid the truth this whole time but this was the finale thing to confirm it. Quinn had his suspicion after reading the book, but everything was adding up, him being weaker in the sun, his night vision, and the fact the system wanted him to drink blood.</p><p>But now it was telling him that he would have to drink blood otherwise he would die. Quinn stood there looking down at Rylee who was passed out lying on the ground.</p><p>Quinn gulped his saliva down, for some reason something was drawing him to Rylee\'s body. Without realizing it, he was slowly moving forward and suddenly he could see Rylee\'s pulse beating through his neck.

When she saw Quinn following Rylee and him holding the mask, she had an idea of what Quinn was planning to do. She kept a safe distance back while staying in between the trees to avoid being seen.</p><p>That\'s when she saw the whole thing. She saw Quinn put on the mask and beat Rylee to the ground but then she was wondering what Quinn was doing. He was kneeling on the floor as if he was in pain and now, he was looking at Rylee very strangely she thought.</p><p>The next second she saw Quinn go to the ground and lift Rylee\'s body slightly off the floor.</p><p>\"What the…\" Layla said, \"He can\'t be planning to... kiss him, what is wrong with this person?\"</p><p>Quinn continued to lift Rylee of the ground and place him back down again as he was deciding on what to do.</p><p>\"Damn it, in the movies it so much easier.\" Quinn said, \"The idea of sticking my teeth into someone, I just can\'t do it.\"</p><p>In the end, Quinn decided to leave Rylee\'s body there and head back to the school.</p><p>\"I wonder what that was all about, in the end, he didn\'t do anything?\" Layla thought.</p><p>Quinn started to head back to school and placed the mask back in his shopping bag. He noticed that the ice cream he had bought had melted but for some reason when he looked at it, in no longer looked appetizing.</p><p>There was a hunger in his stomach that he knew wouldn\'t be satisfied with food and he wondered just how long he would be able to hold it in.</p><p>When Quinn had finally arrived back at school, he decided to stop by the toilet first. Quinn was looking at himself in the mirror to see if there were any noticeable changes but Quinn looked the same as before. Then Quinn lifted up his lips so he could get a better view of his teeth but they too had stayed the same.</p><p>\"Phew, at least it looks like no one will be able to tell. I wonder why I felt pain in my teeth at the time then?\"</p><p>Quinn then decided to open his status screen to see if there were any differences from before now that he had levelled up and evolved.</p><p>\\u003cName: Quinn Talen\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cRace: Half-Ling\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cHP 15/15\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cExp 50/200\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cStrength 10\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cAgility 10\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cStamina 10\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cAttribute points available (1)\\u003e</p><p>Quinn\'s health had increased by 50 percent while everything else seemed to have remained the same.

Quinn thought about it for a while and decided to add a point to his Agility.</p><p>\\u003cAgility 11\\u003e</p><p>Even though Quinn wanted to put it into strength in case he met more people like Rylee, he thought he could overcome that problem with a good beast weapon and would just be a waste of stats. What he wanted right now was to be able to be fast and agile like an assassin.</p><p>Quinn wondered if there was a reason why the system had only given him one point, then he started to remember the additional quest that it had given him. As long as Quinn consumed the blood of his victim, it would give him a stat point.</p><p>So far Quinn would have been able to have an additional two stat points while levelling up only gave him one. If Quinn wanted to get stronger then this would be the quickest way.</p><p>But Quinn was unsure on whether or not he would be able to do it, he needed to try to do more research into the system and see if there was anything he could find out. </p><p>He had a direction now and knew his system was similar to that of a vampire. Perhaps if he learned more about them he would be able to figure out if there was a way around drinking the blood as well.</p><p>With that, Quinn decided to head to his room where he could hear Vorden and Peter practicing together. Peter was trying his best to learn the skill book the military had given him, while Vorden was tutoring him.</p><p>When Quinn had entered the room, Vorden and Peter greeted him as usual.</p><p>\"What took you so long?\" Vorden asked, \"We thought you might have gotten lost.\"</p><p>\"No, I just went exploring the city a little\" Quinn replied, \"I\'m a bit tired I think I\'m going to go bed early.\"</p><p>\"Maybe we should call it a day for now as well,\" Peter said.</p><p>With that, the group turned off the lights and went to sleep. All except for one person that is.</p><p>Quinn was unable to sleep, his stomach was in a tremendous amount of pain and he had too much on his mind. Eventually though, he finally managed to close his eyes and drift off. </p><p>When he woke up the next day though, the pain was worse than ever. His head was ringing and his senses felt like they were on high alert. The first thing Quinn did was open up his system.</p><p>\\u003c10 hours have passed\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cYou hunger grows\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cYou have lost -10Hp\\u003e</p><p>\\u003c HP 5/15\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cYour HP will continue to decrease every hour\\u003e</p><p>This was bad, Quinn finally realized that he had no choice and didn\'t have time to figure out another way. He needed to drink human blood and he needed to in the next five hours.</p><p><br/></p>'),(203,9,'Chapter 19 Running out of time',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 19 Running out of time!</h3><p></p><p>                          Even though Quinn had lost 2/3 of his HP, it didn\'t feel like he was hurt or dying. It wasn\'t like when he was out in the sun when he felt week, instead, it felt like all his senses were on high alert.</p><p>\"Hey Quinn, are you alright man?\" Vorden asked seeing Quinn\'s face in shock.</p><p>\"Yeah, I just, got to go somewhere,\" Quinn said as he rushed out of the room, heading down to the canteen.</p><p>Everything that happened so far was a miscalculation on Quinn\'s part. Although the system had told him he would lose 1 hp every hour, he didn\'t expect his body to react like this. Originally, he only planned to sleep for five hours as he was too worn out after the fight yesterday.</p><p>That way he would still have at least ten hours and a few hours in the morning before classes started. Quinn started to calculate how much time he had left. Breakfast was a requirement which lasted from 8 till 9, then classes went on till 12 midday for lunch.</p><p>That meant there were four more hours where he was required to be somewhere in the school. Of course, there was always the option of skipping, but this wasn\'t like regular school. The army would severely punish you and hunt you down if you did. But what did that matter if he was going to die anyway?</p><p>Quinn was currently in the canteen queue to be served some food. He was breathing in deep breaths and in and out slowly, it was helping him get the hang of his heightened senses. He could hear the conversation from the other side of the room.</p><p>Pots and pans clanging in the kitchen as if they were next to him. Slowly Quinn was figuring out how to ignore all these and it was making his mind think clearer.</p><p>Just then though, Rylee had entered the canteen. He had no markings on his body from the fight yesterday as he had managed to make a full recovery at the medical centre but he was in a terrible mood after what had happened yesterday.</p><p>As soon as he saw Quinn, he had found a target to take out all his pent-up frustration on. Rylee walked past all the level ones that were in the queue until he eventually reached the spot were Quinn was standing.</p><p>\"Hey Pipsqueak, you got a problem if I cut Infront of you?\" Rylee asked.</p><p>But Quinn was too busy trying to focus the sounds out from his mind.</p><p>\"Are you ignoring me? Today is not the day to ignore me.\" Rylee looked at Quinn\'s wristwatch seeing the number 1 shine bright on it. Immediately bad memories of yesterdays fight had come into his head and how all he wanted to do was kill the person but that would have to wait for now and Quinn would have to do.</p><p>\"I said don\'t ignore me?\" Rylee said as he grabbed Quinn by the collar.</p><p>But in that instant, Rylee\'s face was incredibly close to Quinn\'s. Quinn could hear Rylee\'s heartbeat. He could feel the blood flowing through his arm and muscles lifting his shirt.</p><p>Something had taken over Quinn\'s body and he immediately hit Rylee\'s arm away and pounced on him causing the two of them to fall to the ground.</p><p>Quinn was now on top of Rylee and had both his hands pinned down.</p><p>\"Get off me you crazy animal!\" Rylee said but when Rylee tried to overpower Quinn and lift his hands, it was impossible. Even his Ability was useless in this situation. His ability only hardened his skin, it didn\'t make him any more powerful.</p><p>Then Quinn started to feel something growing in his mouth. Quinn placed his head just a few inches away from Rylee\'s neck and was ready. Just as Quinn opened his mouth though, he felt someone pull him by the back of his collar and chucked him off Rylee towards the people in the queue.</p><p>\"Don\'t touch one of my boys,\" Dan said.</p><p>Dan was a large man for his age with a muscular build. He didn\'t look like a teenage boy but more like a bald adult.</p><p>\"Dan, thank you so much,\" Rylee said as he stood up from the ground sweating. \"You\'re dead now boy.\"</p><p>As soon as Dan took one step forward though, Vorden stepped Infront of Quinn with Peter.</p><p>\"Do you really want to cause a problem,\" Vorden said lifting his arm to show the power level on his wristwatch.</p><p>The truth was, Vorden was only bluffing. Vorden\'s power very much depended on what ability he copied and right now all he had was Peter\'s level 1 earth ability. If they were to get into a fight here, there was no contest on who would win.</p><p>But Vorden\'s plan seemed to work as Dan decided to back down and take Rylee with him but before Rylee walked off, he signalled to Quinn imitating someone cutting his head off.</p><p>\"Oh, thank you, thank you, I can\'t believe that worked,\" Peter said knowing Vorden\'s secret.</p><p>After the canteen incident was over, something became clear to Quinn. That teaches wouldn\'t step in no matter what happened. In the canteen there were many guards standing in each corner of the room but not once did they step in to help.</p><p>After the group finished eating it was time for them to go to their morning classes but Quinn was unable to concentrate on anything, all he could do was try to calm himself down while in the middle of class and watch his HP slowly tick away.</p><p>It was driving him insane seeing the number go down hour by hour and now wished he had just bitten into Rylee\'s neck yesterday.</p><p>Then when it came to lunchtime, Quinn once again rushed off without Vorden and Peter this time to the library.</p><p>\\u003c1/15 HP\\u003e</p><p>\"What the hell is happening to me?\" Quinn said as his hands wouldn\'t stop shaking.</p><p>Each time Quinn\'s HP would go down, it was getting harder and harder to control his own body and sooner or later he would go crazy. During class, he had multiple visions of tearing the place apart and ripping out the blood from their necks.</p><p>Without realising where he was walking to, Quinn eventually ended up in the library. In the quiet corner of the library down one of the isles was the fiction section.</p><p>\"Please have something I can use,\" Quinn said as he took out fantasy book after fantasy book about Vampires.</p><p>In some of the books, Vampires were able to live off animal blood, But Quinn\'s system clearly stated he needed human blood. Not just that but it would be hard for him to find an animal in time. In other stories, there were talks of going to the hospital and raiding their supply but the hospital in the city was heavily guarded and he didn\'t have time for that.</p><p>Finally, for the first time, Quinn could feel himself getting weaker. He sat on the floor and read one last book and found nothing of use. When he closed the book, he could see Layla standing there opposite him.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\" Layla asked concerned for Quinn as he was starting to look very pale.</p><p>Layla then bent down so she was at eye level with Quinn and placed her hand on his forehead to check his temperature.</p><p>\"You\'re so cold? Do you want me to take you to the nurse\'s office?\" Layla asked.</p><p>Quinn replied with one word.</p><p>\"Sorry…\"</p><p>He said as he pulled Layla\'s arm bringing her close to him and bit into Layla\'s neck.</p><p><br/></p>'),(204,9,'Chapter 20 A Problem',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 20 A Problem</h3><p></p><p>                          As Quinn opened his mouth wide, he could feel the ends of his teeth start to grow, he didn\'t know what had come over him and it was as if his body had just taken control, his mind wasn\'t all there.</p><p>His teeth quickly sunk into Layla\'s skin and at the same time, a gush of blood entered Quinn\'s mouth. However, Layla didn\'t feel any pain from this but instead, it felt like pleasure. A tingling sensation ran through her body as she felt the blood rush up through and out of her neck.</p><p>Even if she wanted to resist, she couldn\'t, the bite seemed to have a paralysis effect.</p><p>Finally, Quinn\'s hunger was going away.</p><p>\\u003cYour hunger has decreased \\u003e</p><p>\\u003cYour hunger has decreased \\u003e</p><p>\\u003cYou will no longer lose HP\\u003e</p><p>Even though the messages had appeared, Quinn continued to suck Layla\'s blood away.</p><p>\\u003cHP regenerating\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cHP regenerating\\u003e</p><p>\\u003c15/15 HP\\u003e</p><p>Then when the last message had appeared, Quinn\'s mind had finally come back to him. He let got of Layla, causing her body to fall to the ground.</p><p>\"What the?\" Quinn said as he looked around himself, only then noticing Layla on the ground.</p><p>\"Did I do that?\"</p><p>Then images of what he had just done popped into his head, although at the time he felt like he had no control, in the end, his whole body still working causing him to remember everything he had done.</p><p>\\u003cA+ blood type has been absorbed\\u003e</p><p>\\u003c You have gained 1+ strength\\u003e</p><p>Although Quinn wanted to check what the message had said and what it had it meant, he needed to get Layla out of the library fast. Even though they were in a quiet part of the library, there was no telling when somebody would come back.</p><p>Thankfully Quinn could see Layla breathing so he at least knew she wasn\'t dead but there were two clear bite marks on her neck that needed to be dealt with. Quinn then lifted Layla up with his two hands, finding her surprisingly lighter than he thought.</p><p>As Quinn headed to the Doctor\'s office, he couldn\'t stop thinking about what had just happened. A part of him thought that the system might have just been playing tricks on him. Even though he could see his HP going down, he never felt like he was going to die at any point.</p><p>And Quinn didn\'t even know if going to 0 HP meant death but after what had happened today, he didn\'t want to find out. </p><p>There were a few things Quinn needed to do. He needed to find out how frequent his body required blood. To do this meant he would have to once again starve his body of blood.</p><p>But this time he would get blood beforehand, so he would be better prepared. But before even all that, he had another serious problem in his hands. Layla, would she remember anything when she got up, or would Quinn have to convince her to keep it a secret?</p><p>If others were to find out of his rare ability it would start a bidding war between the private companies and military. They would do anything to get their hand on a new type of ability.</p><p>Before anyone could find out about Quinn, he needed to be strong enough to protect himself. </p><p>While Quinn walked down the hallway, he got quite a few looks from the other students, it wasn\'t strange to see someone carry an injured person in the school but it was strange for a boy to carry a girl unless they were an item.</p><p>Finally, Quinn had reached the infirmary, where there was a single female doctor named Hayley, who looked to be in her early thirties. She wore round glasses and had her hair up in a ponytail. Quinn never got the chance to mess around with girls while he was at school but looking at the doctor, he couldn\'t help but appreciate her natural beauty.</p><p>\"Another one?\" Hayley said. \"There\'s a bed free at the back, take her over there.\"</p><p>Quinn did as he was told and placed Layla gently on one of the single beds in the back. The infirmary was quite large, Quinn had never seen a school have one so big. There was a total of 30 beds but Hayley was the only one working there.</p><p>At the moment about half the beds were filled up with students and Quinn couldn\'t help but notice most of them were low levels. There were the odd high levels as well. Even they got into their own fights and disagreements.</p><p>Hayley came over to where Quinn and Layla were and started to examine Layla. She placed her hand around her Wrist and did a few other checks. That\'s when she noticed the two small hole marks on her neck.</p><p>\"What happened? Hayley asked.</p><p>\"I\'m not sure, I was in the library when I saw her on the ground like that,\" Quinn replied.</p><p>\"I don\'t know how long she was passed out for but the wound on her neck looks like it\'s already healing on its own.\" Hayley said, \"Still I can\'t be sure if it will heal and it would be a shame if a pretty girl like her got a scar.\"</p><p>Hayley then placed her hand on Layla\'s neck where the bite marks were. She closed her eyes and after a few seconds, lifted her hands and the bite marks had vanished.</p><p>\"Is it okay if I wait here for her?\" Quinn asked.</p><p>\"Oh, young kids these days,\" Hayley said laughing. \"I didn\'t realise you two were like that.\"</p><p>\"No, No, no,\" Quinn said waving his arms. \"Were just friends that\'s all.\"</p><p>After Hayley had gone away to look after other students, Quinn decided to open up his system.</p><p>\\u003c Strength 11\\u003e</p><p>\\u003c Agility 11\\u003e</p><p>\\u003cStamina 10\\u003e</p><p>\"It really did give me an extra stat point after all?\"</p><p>After sucking Layla\'s blood, it seemed like he had gained a stat point. Quinn remembered after defeating opponents the system would give him an additional quest to suck his victim\'s blood. The reward was a stat point but it seemed like there was no need for him to get a quest.</p><p>Was Quinn able to drink anyone\'s blood and gain stat points, what happened if Quinn was to drink Layla\'s blood again, would he gain another stat? there were so many questions Quinn wanted answers for.</p><p>He looked at Layla lying there peacefully. Right now, he was in complete control of his body and there was no urge for him to suck on Layla\'s neck again. After checking his teeth, he realised that they had gone back to normal.</p><p>That\'s when Quinn decided to look around the room, until he finally found what he was looking for, a syringe with a needle. Quinn looked around the room and saw that Hayley was busy dealing with another student. He carefully took the syringe and hid it behind his back and then quickly scooted over to where Layla was once more.</p><p>\"I\'m really sorry about this Layla.\" Quinn said, \"But you\'re going to have to be my guinea pig.\"</p><p>Quinn took out the syringe and carefully looked at where Layla\'s veins were. Luckily Layla was quite pale making her veins more visible.</p><p>Quinn searched carefully for the right spot and was ready but just as Quinn was about to extract some blood, he heard someone crash into the room.</p><p>\"Is Quinn here.\" A boy\'s voice said.</p><p>\"Isn\'t that Peter?\" Quinn immediately put the syringe in one of his trouser pockets and went to see what was happening.</p><p>\"Quinn you\'re here, come quick, I\'ve been looking everywhere for you. It\'s Vorden, he\'s in trouble!\"</p><p><br/></p>'),(205,9,'Chapter 21 Im a monster',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 21 I\'m a monster</h3><p></p><p>                          Although Quinn had no idea what was happening, just from looking at Peter\'s face he could tell it was serious. Quinn then looked behind to see Layla lying there still sleeping away.</p><p>It was important for Quinn to be there when Layla woke up. He had to convince her to not tell anyone her secret but right now it seemed like Vorden was in trouble.</p><p>Quinn then thought back to the incident at the canteen. When Quinn was in trouble Vorden stepped up to help him.</p><p>Although there probably wasn\'t much Quinn could do to help, he wouldn\'t know if he didn\'t try. </p><p>What kind of person would he be if he couldn\'t help Vorden now?</p><p>\"Alright come on,\" Quinn said. \"Let\'s hurry.\"</p><p>The two of them quickly ran through the hallways until they had finally reached the assembly hall. It was currently a large empty hall with marble flooring and a stage at the front. It hadn\'t been used for anything yet so far but it was the area where the students would be called if they were to have a meeting.</p><p>When the two of them entered the assembly hall, there were already multiple students there mumbling about a commotion.</p><p>\"Did you see what happened\\u003e\"</p><p>\"Yeah, that guy is a monster how could he do that?\"</p><p>\"Luckily the second-year students were here to stop him.\"</p><p>The assembly hall was complete trashed. Craters and rubble had formed on parts of the walls and ground. Burn marks and other things were there as well and there was even blood. Something Quinn could smell the second he had entered the room.</p><p>\"What happened here?\" Quinn asked, \"Where\'s Vorden?\"</p><p>Clearly, a fight had taken place here and Quinn feared the worst.</p><p>\"I don\'t know,\" Peter replied. \"Me and Vorden were busy messing around practising my earth ability together, that\'s when a bunch of second years I\'d never seen before came up to us asking for Vorden. Vorden told me not to worry but of course, I worried so I followed them. That\'s when I saw them take him to the assembly hall but two of the students stood guard and wouldn\'t let me come inside. I didn\'t know what to do, so that\'s when I came looking for you.\"</p><p>Quinn and Peter then went around asking the students what happened but when they did, the students seemed to avoid the question or completely ignore them, as if they were told not to tell anyone what they had seen.</p><p>While Peter continued to ask the students that were still in the hall about what happened. Quinn already knew that they wouldn\'t give him any more answers so he started to do some inspecting of his own.</p><p>The smell of iron in the room was thicker than anything else to Quinn and it led him to an area where dried up could be seen on the floor.</p><p>\"Inspect.\"</p><p>Name: Vorden Blade</p><p>Race: Human</p><p>Blood type: O-</p><p>Quinn started to inspect the battle scene and found more traces of blood but when he used the inspect skill on them, it wouldn\'t show him any information at all. It would only show \\u003c?????\\u003e</p><p>\"Do I have to use the inspect skill on them in person?\" Quinn thought.</p><p>It was a shame the blood on the floor had already dried up, otherwise, Quinn would have used the syringe he had on hand.</p><p>Just then, Peter had finished questioning everyone and returned to Quinn.</p><p>\"It doesn\'t;t look like anyone wants to talk,\" Peter said.</p><p>\"Figures, let\'s just head back to our dorm, who knows he might have returned.\"</p><p>The two of them then headed back to the Dorm room together and when they entered, they were surprised to actually see Vorden already there. However, something wasn\'t right, Vorden wasn\'t his regular self.</p><p>Just by looking at him Quinn and Peter could tell he had been in a ruff fight. Bruises and scuff marks everywhere, Large cuts on his back. He looked like he had been in a tough battle. Not only that but Vorden didn\'t even great them when the two entered.</p><p>The Vorden they had come to know, was not the same Vorden right now. Vorden just stayed there lying down on his bed.</p><p>\"Vorden, what happened is everything all right?\" Peter asked.</p><p>\"Yeah, just leave me be I\'ll be fine,\" Vorden said. \"If you stay near me you will just get hurt anyway.\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about Vorden!\" Peter shouted. \"Look at you, you have to go to the doctor\'s office, come on let\'s go.\"</p><p>\"Just leave me alone please,\" Vorden said quietly.</p><p>\"Quinn, come on say something he needs to go to the doctor\'s office right…\" But as Peter turned around to seek support from Quinn. Quinn was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\"Even he thinks I\'m a monster,\" Vorden mumbled to himself.</p><p>Just outside the dorm room. Quinn was leaning up against door panting hard and sweating. Although he had no reaction when looking at people anymore, it was different when he saw Vorden. Vorden still had fresh cut marks all over his body and the smell coming off him was strong.</p><p>Suddenly Quinn felt like he had a craving for a little bit of blood. It was something he could control, it wasn\'t like last time where his body had taken over but it had brought back bad memories for him and he was a little afraid of what might have happened.</p><p>\"I really need to find out what\'s going on with this strange system ability I have?\"</p><p>Then a thought came into his head, there was a pending problem that he still hadn\'t dealt with. Although Vorden was acting strange right now, Quinn knew he was safe. Whatever problems Vorden where dealing with now, would just have to wait.</p><p>Every second wasted meant there was a chance for Layla to wake up and who knew what would happen when she did.</p><p>****</p><p>Just then at the same time in the doctor\'s office, in the corner, at the back of the room, Layla slowly started to open her eyes.</p><p>\"Huh, what happened?\" Layla said, \"Where am I?\"</p><p>As Layla looked around the room, she started to rub her neck and at the same time images had flashed through her head of what had happened at the library. </p><p>She remembered everything.</p><p><br/></p>'),(206,9,'Chapter 22 Laylas Reques',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 22 Layla\'s Reques</h3><p></p><p>                          When images of what had happened to Layla started flashing through her head, she immediately started to get this tingling feeling over her body. She was reacting to the memories of Quinn biting into her.</p><p>It wasn\'t a painful memory but quite an addictive feeling. The sensation of the blood rushing through her body. Her face was starting to turn a little red just thinking about it. That\'s when she lifted her hand and placed it on her neck.</p><p>\"Huh, I can\'t feel anything?\"</p><p>\"Oh, so you\'re awake,\" Haley said with a smile. \"You were sleeping so peacefully there I didn\'t know when you were going to wake up.\"</p><p>\"How did I get here?\" Layla asked.</p><p>\"Oh a boy came in and dropped you off, he said he was your friend, I can\'t remember his name but he had short black curly hair,\" Hayley said with a smile thinking about the tow of them.</p><p>This confirmed Layla\'s thought. Quinn must have brought her here right after biting her.</p><p>Hayley then noticed that Layla was rubbing the side of her neck with her hand.</p><p>\"Oh, I got rid of those two marks for you, do you remember what happened.\"</p><p>Once again as she thought back to the memory of Quinn biting her, she started to get goose bumps all over her body.</p><p>\"I\'m not sure maybe it was a beast?\" Layla replied</p><p>\"A beast?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, I here sometimes a stray can come out with the students while they\'re training through the portals,\" Layla said nervously hoping that Hayley would believe her lie.</p><p>\"Well whatever it was, I\'m sure someone else will deal with it, it\'s just a good thing your safe now.\"</p><p>****</p><p>Quinn was running through the school halls as fast as he could, he needed to make it to the doctor\'s office before Layla woke up. He had no idea how Layla would react, not only that but what were the consequences of biting someone?</p><p>If it was like some of the Vampire Novels Quinn had read in the library, some vampires had the ability to turn others. Right now, Quinn thought that might be a better situation than everyone finding out about his ability.</p><p>Finally, Quinn had reached the doctor\'s office and he pulled the door wide open.</p><p>\"Oh hello again,\" Hayley said. \"If you\'re looking for the girl you just missed her, she left a little while ago.\"</p><p>\"Really? Did she happen to say anything?\" Quinn asked, judging by Haley\'s reaction it didn\'t seem like Layla had said anything but he needed to make sure.</p><p>\"Oh you mean about the wound, she said that a beast might have attacked her, although I highly doubt that, it looked more like snake bite but how did it manage to get into the school and all the way up her neck.\" Hayley continued to ramble on. She often did this as she was left on her own a lot of the times being the only doctor stationed at the school. It was a lonely Job.</p><p>\"Thanks for letting me know,\" Quinn said as he closed the door.</p><p>Why did Layla decide to keep it a secret Quinn thought? He had basically assaulted the poor girl, good it be that she didn\'t remember what happened or maybe she was planning to use at blackmail against him but that didn\'t make sense, she had nothing to gain.</p><p>Quinn had always thought like this, people when they did something, always did it for selfish reasons, that\'s just the way people were. He couldn\'t believe that Layla would keep this a secret for no reason.</p><p>Just then while Quinn was outside the doctor\'s office thinking of what to do next. He felt a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\"You and me, we need to talk,\" Layla said.</p><p>Had she been waiting here this whole time, this was bad. Layla clearly indicated that she knew something which meant losing her memory of the events where unlikely.</p><p>The two of them then headed to the library where then incident took place. Quinn felt a bit more relaxed, taking him here meant she wasn\'t looking for a fight as there were other students in the room.</p><p>The two of them sat at a table and activated the Orb so only the two of them could be heard. As they looked into each other\'s eyes for a bit, Quinn started to run multiple scenarios through his head. If worst came to worst, he might have to silence her.</p><p>\"What happened at the library, what did you do?\" Layla asked rubbing her neck.</p><p>\"Why bother asking if you already know what happened?\" Quinn said. \"Just tell me what you want?\"</p><p>\"I don\'t know if you know this but I kept an eye on you for longer than you think, after observing you for a while a came to a conclusion. You\'re a Vampire, aren\'t you?\"</p><p>Quinn started to laugh nervously hoping to throw Layla of track. He was actually amazed by how she had come to the conclusion so fast when it even took him a while. Even if she did see everything, he had done so far he didn\'t think this was the natural conclusion someone would come to.</p><p>\"And why would you think that?\"</p><p>\"I saw you lifting, that boy\'s neck, at the time I thought you doing something else cause I couldn\'t see clearly,\" Layla said as her ears started to heat up a little. \"But after what you had done to me, it confirms it.\"</p><p>Quinn started to sweat slightly at the integration. He wasn\'t worried about Layla herself but the troubles she could bring him in the future. Quinn didn\'t know what to say and thought he would wait for Layla to make her demand.</p><p>Layla then took a deep breath before saying her next words. This is what Quinn was waiting for, her request.</p><p>\"I want you to hear me out. I want you to make me a Vampire.\"</p><p>Quinn was so shocked by the words that had come out of Layla\'s mouth that he nearly fell out of his seat.</p><p>\"What, do you realise what you are saying right now?\"</p><p>\"Please,\" Layla said as if she was begging him. \"It\'s a childhood dream of mine, this type of things only happens in books or fairy tales and now I have the chance for it to happen right now.\" She said with her eyes lit up.</p><p>Now Quinn realised why Layla didn\'t tell anyone, simply put this girl was crazy.</p><p><br/></p>'),(207,9,'Chapter 23 An asisstan',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 23 An asisstan</h3><p></p><p>                          Layla had grown up her whole life reading fantasy stories and comics about all sorts of things. Before the whole war started, her father used to work as a writer, so her home was filled with books and stories and her favourite ones were always about vampires.</p><p>She loved everything about them, how they had to keep their identity secret to the world, the super-strength they had, the super speed and the fact that they could live on nearly forever.</p><p>When Abilities were realised to the world, it made fantasy stories a thing of the past. Many people read stories because they were that, fantasy. It allowed them to imagine doing something that they could never do but now that humans actually had special powers, what was the point?</p><p>However, the love for Vampires never died down for Layla, it only grew. If abilities exited then that meant somewhere out their maybe vampires did too. When she saw Quinn\'s actions, she had already convinced herself that he was a vampire.</p><p>Quinn was right when he thought a normal person wouldn\'t have come to the same conclusion but that\'s was because Layla wasn\'t a normal person.</p><p>Layla then suddenly got out of her seat and started to bow down to Quinn on her knees. The students in the room although couldn\'t hear their conversation, couldn\'t help but look at them.</p><p>\"Please, I\'ll do anything for you,\" Layla said.</p><p>\"Alright, I understand please get up,\" Quinn said.</p><p>The two of them sat down at their seats again, before Quinn started to speak, he let out a big sigh, thinking about how he was going to explain this to her.</p><p>\"It\'s not what you think,\" Quinn said, \"I\'m not a vampire, I became like this from an Ability book.\"</p><p>Suddenly the smile on Layal\'s face disappeared.</p><p>\"You know what that means right?\" Quinn asked.</p><p>Layla nodded. Quinn was basically telling her it was impossible for him to give her this ability. The reason was a human body could only activate one ability. When learning an ability, it mutated the genes inside of your body but once your genes had been mutated, they could no longer change or add a second mutation.</p><p>Because Layla already had the ability of telekinesis, it meant Layla was unable to learn a second ability.</p><p>\"Then why did you hide this from the academy, why did you tell them you had no ability. If you got this from an ability book you can\'t be an original?\"</p><p>\"Have you ever heard of an ability like this?\" Quinn asked.</p><p>Layla thought about for a while and realised there was nothing quite like it. There was never a record of an ability requiring someone to drink blood.</p><p>\"But if you told the school you got it from an ability book, one that\'s not even been registered and you aren\'t an original, you could make a fortune selling the book!\" Layla said excitedly.</p><p>\"I wish that was true but I can\'t do that either,\" Quinn explained. \"When I learnt the ability the book simply vanished.\"</p><p>Layla was debating whether Quinn was telling the truth or not but she had no choice but to believe him. It was the only explanation of why Quinn was so adamant in hiding his ability. Ability books didn\'t just vanish they were books. They could be passed on for others to learn.</p><p>If people found out about this, multiple companies and the military would put immense pressure on Quinn to share the ability with the world and with no powerful family backing him, Layla couldn\'t imagine what would be done to him.</p><p>They would never believe him if he said he got it from an ability book and it disappeared.</p><p>Quinn then proceeded to tell Layla about everything that had happened so far. About how his ability was a game, like a system and it had given him strange quests and he could unlock skills. It was nothing like the Vampire stories Layla used to read but at the same time, it seemed like the system was applying similar rules.  </p><p>\"Fine, I will keep this as a secret but only on one condition. I want you to help you out.\" Layla said. \"Clearly you don\'t know much about this thing, so much so that you had gone out of control and bit me in the neck. We can\'t have you going around school biting people. They\'ll take you away in a heartbeat. If you need to feast on someone, then feast on me.\" Layla said placing her hand on herself.</p><p>Quinn started to think about the situation, having Layla as a helper was a big advantage. Quinn himself wanted to test multiple things about the system and here he had someone offering to help for free.</p><p>And it truly felt like Layla was telling the truth. Not only that but Layla seemed to be more knowledgeable about vampires then himself. Perhaps she would even be able to help him in his research.</p><p>\"It\'s a deal,\" Quinn said as the two of them shook hands.</p><p>Layla was happy that Quinn had accepted. The truth was Layla still hadn\'t given up the idea of being a Vampire. Unlike Quinn, Layla wasn\'t too sure that what Quinn had was an ability in the first place. An ability was usually a specific set of skills but Quinn had completely changed as if he was no longer human.</p><p>\"Alright, the first thing is first, you going to need to take some of my blood.\" Layla said, \"That way if you\'re getting hungry again, you can drink some of that.</p><p>Layla then pulled down her shirt slightly and started to show her neck towards Quinn.</p><p>\"What are you thinking, we can\'t do it here in front of the library and I\'m not just going to bite into your neck.\"</p><p>As the two continued to talk and chat about things in the library about what to do next.</p><p>Vorden had entered the library and could see Quinn talking to Layla, both chatting and smiling away.</p><p>\"So you\'ve forgotten about me that quickly huh,\" Vorden said, \"You\'re just like the rest of them, I\'ll show you what it means to betray me Quinn. If people are going to call me a monster, then I might as well embrace it and become one.\"</p><p><br/></p>'),(208,9,'Chapter 24 A School secre',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 24 A School secre</h3><p></p><p>                          Peter was currently running around the school looking for Quinn or Vorden. For some reason, both of his new friends had suddenly started acting very strange and Peter didn\'t know what to do about it. His life at his previous school had been hell and he did everything he could to serve those above him.</p><p>And for the first time ever he had made friends that protected him. Quinn, even though he was a low level himself had stood up for Peter and Vorden who had not only protected him but helped him learn his new ability. Something had happened to Vorden and suddenly he was acting strange.</p><p>Although Peter had no clue what was going on with Quinn, he had some idea about what had changed Vorden. It was after whatever had happened at the assembly hall with the second-year students. But no matter who he would talk to about it, not one person would give him an answer. Some even begin to threaten him.</p><p>That\'s when Peter could hear a familiar voice. While walking down the hallway Peter could hear someone speaking, a voice he recognised. As he turned the corner, he saw that is was indeed Vorden. Vorden stood there staring idly at the ground. Peter quickly hid back around the hallway corner.</p><p>So far whenever Peter had spotted Vorden, he would just ignore him and walk away without even speaking to him but now it sounded like Vorden was speaking to someone else. </p><p>\"Would you two calm down,\" Vorden said.</p><p>There was then a brief pause before Vorden spoke again.</p><p>\"I don\'t care if he hurt the little one\'s feelings, it\'s not like Quinn isn\'t allowed to talk to other people.\"</p><p>Again, there was a slight pause.</p><p>\"Look if you get involved and hurt them, I won\'t forgive you. I won\'t let something like last time happen again.\"</p><p>The whole time Peter was listening in to the conversation the only voice he could hear was Vorden\'s but it was clear that he was speaking to someone. Peter couldn\'t take it anymore and decided to take a peak and as he did still the only person he could see was Vorden.</p><p>\"Did the other person leave already?\" Peter thought.</p><p>Just then he saw Vorden start to walk off. The bell had rung indicating that it was the end of their lunch break and it was time to head to afternoon classes. That\'s when the library doors opened and Quinn and Layla appeared out walking together.</p><p>\"Quinn!\" Peter said as he waved him over.</p><p>\"I\'ll meet you at the front gate tonight once classes are over,\" Quinn said to Layla before leaving to join Peter.</p><p>The two of them then started to walk off to class together.</p><p>\"Hey, are you okay man?\" Peter asked. \"I was worried about you when you suddenly bolted out of the room like that.\"</p><p>\"Yeah sorry man, I couldn\'t hold it in any longer otherwise my underwear would have turned brown.\"</p><p>\"Woah, whoa too much information,\" Peter said. \"Anyway, I\'m glad you\'re okay, look I\'m really worried about Vorden. Ever since he came back from that assembly hall, he\'s been acting strange.\"</p><p>Quinn placed his hand on Peter seeing that he was clearly startled. This whole time Quinn had more important things to worry about but now that he had solved the most pressing matter, he had time to focus on other things.</p><p>\"Don\'t worry, we\'ll find out what\'s going on together.\"</p><p>When they entered their next class, they could see that Vorden was already in his seat sat down, ready even before them.</p><p>\"Oh hey guys, how you doing?\" Vorden said with a smile.</p><p>Peter went to sit in his seat to the right of Vorden while Quinn went to sit in his seat to the left of Vorden.</p><p> \"Hey, are you feeling better?\" Peter asked, \"Earlier it seemed like you were kinda sulking.\"</p><p>\"Yeah don\'t worry, I just got kinda thrown around a bit by the second years and it got me pretty down,\" Vorden replied.</p><p>\"What happened at the assembly hall?\" Quinn asked.</p><p>Then Vorden\'s face slightly changed, it was as if he was trying to hold something back. Vorden clenched his fist for a few seconds and finally relaxed his hand.</p><p>\"Guy\'s don\'t worry about it too much, you know I\'m strong and know I can handle myself.\"</p><p>All though Peter was quite satisfied now with Vorden, as he seemed to be his regular self, Quinn noticed that Vorden seemed to be holding something back, all most suppressing something when he asked that question.</p><p>As other students started to enter the classroom when they saw Vorden they immediately started to whisper. If Vorden would look back at them they would turn their head as soon as possible.</p><p>As the students sat down the talks continued and several different words could be heard. Monster, Freak, weirdo, crazy, and all these words were being aimed at Vorden. It was as if the whole school was sharing a secret that Peter and Quinn weren\'t allowed to know and not even Vorden himself would say what had happened.</p><p>After hearing these words Quinn noticed that Vorden stayed their motionless with his head down, he hadn\'t even written any notes down in his notebook about the lesson.</p><p>Although it seemed like no one would tell him or Peter what had happened, Quinn now had another ally that might be able to help him and that was Layla.</p><p>At the end of class, the teacher Dell projected a screen in front of the whole class. There was a list of names each sorted into a different category.</p><p>\"Please look at this carefully and see where your name is, as tomorrow will be the start fo your combat classes,\" Del explained.</p><p>The list was split up into several different categories each one was different depending on what type of ability you had. Elemental abilities, Transformation abilities, Enhancement abilities, and so on.</p><p>That\'s when Quinn also noticed that his and a few other names were not on the list including Vorden\'s.</p><p>\"If your name is not on the list it\'s because either your Ability doesn\'t fall into one of the categories or you are an original with a unique ability. You are free to choose to go to whichever class you believe suits you. Students are also able to switch between combat classes if they wish. These are not set in stone but the schools recommendation based on your ability.\"</p><p>The list of available classes was then sent to each student\'s wristwatch where they were to register for the type of class, they would be interested In.</p><p>\"I wonder what combat class would be best for me?\" Quinn thought as he looked at the long list.</p><p><br/></p>'),(209,9,'Chapter 25 Testing Blood',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 25 Testing Blood</h3><p></p><p>                          After classes had finished for the Day, Vorden had offered to help Peter with his training again. Especially since tomorrow the two of them would be in the same combat classes, the elemental class.</p><p>\"Hey, do you want to come with us?\" Peter asked.</p><p> \"Nah, I won\'t bother you guys, I wouldn\'t be much help anyway,\" Quinn replied.</p><p>Peter was pleased that it seemed like the group had gotten back normal again. There was no tension between the three of them and Peter whished it would stay that way forever.</p><p>Just then when Quinn had left, Vorden and Peter were left in the room, that\'s when Vorden asked Peter a question.</p><p>\"Hey, have you seen Quinn hanging around with a girl lately?\" Vorden asked.</p><p>\"Come to think of it, I saw him exit with a girl at the library. It was the same one who was at the test with us that day, with the bow and arrow.\"</p><p>After Peter had given an answer, for a split-second, Peter felt like he saw the expression on Vorden\'s face change. But Quinn blinked and looked again and Vorden seemed to be fine.</p><p>\"Maybe he\'s gone and got himself a little girlfriend.\" Said Vorden laughing.</p><p>****</p><p>Quinn had, of course, decided to ditch the other two because he had already made plans to meet up with Layla beforehand. The two of them were to meet at the school gate. But before the two of them were to meet, Quinn decided to stop by the science lab.</p><p>Although most lessons in military school were about combat or how to use technology, science was still a core subject. It was because of scientist that the human race had discovered how to use all the different technologies they had in the world today.</p><p>So students were encouraged to continue to learn science throughout their service time, in hopes they would continue to in the future. </p><p>The classrooms where empty for the day and the important equipment were locked in a storage room.</p><p>But Quinn wasn\'t looking for anything too fancy, all he needed was some test tubes and small corks. After searching around the room for a while he found where they kept the test tubes. He took a total of five test tubes</p><p>Even though there were many there, if he took too much it would be suspicious and Quinn couldn\'t carry more than five without having to worry about them breaking or not.</p><p>Quinn shoved the five test tubes into a messenger bag he was carrying and wrapped them up in a spare shirt he took from his room.</p><p>Quinn currently had a total of 60/200 Exp until his next level up. 50 experience points had carried over from the last quest and he had received ten exp from his two daily quests.</p><p>So far with each level up, he would gain one additional stat point and five points of HP. Although Quinn had gotten stronger through this. It wasn\'t the fastest way for him to improve his strength.</p><p>Quinn realised the system had offered him the chance to gain an additional stat point two times as long as he drank his victim\'s blood but when he drank Layla\'s blood, he still gained a stat point. This was what Quinn wanted to test out today.</p><p>It was 6 o\'clock in the evening and the sun was just starting to set, meaning Quinn wasn\'t affected by the sun right now. As planned Layla was standing there waiting for him by the gate with her bow on her back.</p><p>Students who used weapons would carry it with them around most of the time. There was always the chance of an attack or a beast escaping through a portal.</p><p>After the two of them met, they decided to walk to the nearby park that was in between the convenience store and the school. Then they ventured away from the trail into the woods where they were behind cover. No one ventured in these parts and it was hard for them to be seen.</p><p>\"So are we going to this?\" Layla asked excitedly.</p><p>Quinn still found it weird that rather than being scared by the whole situation, Layla was exited.</p><p>\"Alright close your eyes.\" Said Quinn.</p><p>Layla closed her eyes and was ready. She could still remember the satisfying feeling from the last time and couldn\'t wait to feel it again. Although she was a bit nervous when a thought came to her head that Quinn\'s lips would be on her neck.</p><p>Suddenly though, Layla felt a small prick in her arm.</p><p>Layla opened her eyes and noticed that a needle was there.</p><p>\"What? You didn\'t think I was just going to bite you, did you?\"</p><p>Layla\'s cheeks suddenly went bright red. If it wasn\'t for the needle in her hand, she would have tried kicking Quinn away.</p><p>Once the syringe had been filled up, Quinn squirted it out into one of the test tubes he brought with him.</p><p>\"Is it okay if I fill another one,\" Quinn asked.</p><p>Layla didn\'t say anything and held out her arm, she was still a bit embarrassed about what had happened earlier.</p><p>Once Quinn had filled up two test tubes, he put one of the blood-filled tubes in his bag while holding the other.</p><p>\"Inspect.\"</p><p>\\u003c Blood of Layla Munrow\\u003e</p><p>\\u003c Blood type A + \\u003e</p><p>Quinn then looked at Layla and used his inspect Skill once again.</p><p>\\u003cName: Layla Munrow \\u003e</p><p>\\u003c Race: Human \\u003e</p><p>\\u003c Ability: Telekinesis \\u003e</p><p>\\u003c HP 12/12\\u003e</p><p>\\u003c Blood Type A + \\u003e</p><p>It was as Quinn thought. When using the inspect skill on the blood it only showed him what blood type it was and who it was from. Just like the time at the assembly hall. But if the person was in front of him, it would reveal their ability, HP and Blood type.</p><p>Some of the blood marks in the hall only reviled question marks.  Assuming that Quinn either had to have run into the person before or used the inspect skill on the person once before.</p><p>Quinn looked at the test tube and gulped. He then pulled out the cork at the top and start sniffing the blood.</p><p>\"You\'re not going to drink it right here are you?\" Layla asked.</p><p>\"Why not, I need to know if it will make any changes.\"</p><p>\"I don\'t know it feels kind of embarrassing, I can\'t explain.\"</p><p>Quinn ignored Layla and looked at the blood again. The fragrance smelt quite sweet which was different from how he remembered it before. Then suddenly, Quinn lifted the tube and drank the blood in one gulp as if he was taking an alcoholic shot.</p><p>As the blood ran down his throat, he felt a warm tingling sensation through his body. The blood was also surprisingly sweet rather than metallic. It seemed like the race change had also changed his taste buds and sense of smell.</p><p>\\u003c Your HP is already full \\u003e</p><p>\\u003c The blood will have no effect \\u003e</p><p>\\u003c Blood from this person has already been consumed \\u003e</p><p>\\u003c No stat points will be given \\u003e</p><p>Quinn was surprised to see at the information he had been given. The blood last time seemed to have a healing effect on his body. Judging by the message, if Quinn was injured Layla\'s blood would allow him to regain HP. </p><p>But the second message is what interested him more. The system stated because he had already consumed this blood before, that no stats would be given. This meant that as long as it was the blood of someone he hadn\'t drunk before, he would be able to get an extra stat point.</p><p>Quin smiled at the thought. Of course, this was only a theory of his but Quinn wanted to test it out straight away.</p><p>\"I guess whatever you wanted to test outworked, judging by your creepy smile and all,\" Layla said.</p><p>\"If only there was someone else\'s blood I could test this on.\"</p><p>Just then the sound of two people entering the woods from the playground was heard. Quinn and Layla immediately ducked down and hid behind a tree.</p><p>That\'s when they saw two students started to walk into the forest.</p><p>\"Now hand over your credits, otherwise I\'ll dig you your grave right here and no one will ever find your body.\" A boy\'s voice said. </p><p>Quinn immediately recognised the voice. It was Rylee. It looked like he still hadn\'t learnt his lesson and was still up to his old tricks.</p><p>Quinn then went into his bag and took out the mask he had bought at the convenience store. Last time he had let Rylee go without taking any of his blood and now he felt like it was such a waste. But this time Quinn wouldn\'t let Rylee go.</p><p><br/></p>'),(210,10,'Chapter 1 Snow Girl',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>\"Where do we start?

Currently, she was wearing a silk-like white dress which fluttered gently. She was roughly 5ft 3 a little on the short side of height.

AGI/ Agility so that she could dodge. DEX/ Dexterity so she is able to handle the weapons with better proficiency and reload faster. STR/ Strength so she could actually lift the weapons. </p><p>Though that\'s not to say VIT/ Vitality and DEF/ Defence were not useful. They were, but the four aforementioned stats were the focus of her class, Nanomancer. </p><p>However, with the addition of Snow Girl. She wasn\'t too sure how to distribute her stats. From what she knows, Snow Girls were a low class monster ranking roughly in E ranks. The ranks go from the lowest E to the highest SSS. </p><p>Although Snow Girls were the lowest rank of E. When they become a Snow Woman or Yuki Onna, they belong to the C to B ranks. This was one of the main reasons as to why people would kill Snow Girls when possible to avoid them evolving. </p><p>Snow Woman were known for their magic as it allowed them to wield the power of Ice. They were annoying foes since they would slow your reaction time down or even downright cause you to fall into a coma due to the drop in temperature. </p><p>From what she understands of the Snow Girl class, it would probably be most beneficial to juice up the INT stat due to the fact that they would give her both mana and magic damage. </p><p>\"Since Nanomancer is already a MAX level SSS tier class, most of the skills are unusable due to my lack of mana and strength.\" Shiro muttered looking at her class skills. </p><p class=\"uaxrxm\"></p><p>[Snow Girl: </p><p>Available Skills- </p><p>Tier 1 Ice Magic, Passive Regeneration, Blessed by Ice] </p><p>[Nanomancer: </p><p>Available Skills- </p><p>Dagger Creation] </p><p>\"Hmm… I\'ll put 10 points into AGI and 5 into INT first.

[Collect].\" Shiro said as she collected her loot from the wolves. </p><p>Mana stones had to be manually excavated because the moment she chooses to collect, the wolves bodies would disintegrate into natural mana before scattering. This includes the mana stone which would just be a waste. </p><p>\"Mn?\" Shiro paused when she smelled an enticing aroma. The source seemed to be the mana the wolves disintegrated into. </p><p class=\"uaxrxm\"></p><p>\"Ah! I can eat this!\" Shiro exclaimed as she quickly sucked all the mana into her mouth. Though she pouted a little since she had reacted a little too slow causing her to waste the mana from the start. </p><p>Rather than a meal, it was like she drank a soup. Neither filling nor unfilling. She was satisfied for now. </p><p>Turning back to her inventory, she had a look at the bounty. </p><p>[Wolf Fangs x4] </p><p>[Wolf Pelt x4] </p><p>[Wolf Eye x7] </p><p>[Broken Bones x10] </p><p>\"Che, just a bunch of miscellaneous items. This missy isn\'t a blacksmith nor a pharmacist.

Isn\'t the currency of Aria; gold, silver and copper?\" Shiro muttered seeing the unfamiliar currency. </p><p>\"Maybe I\'m far into the future and the currencies changed?\" Shiro concluded. She did have another theory which was world travel, but that was a bit ridiculous. </p><p>Sitting down, Shiro hugged her legs as she finally decided to look at her surroundings. </p><p>While it was a snow forest, Shiro knew she was in a dungeon. Probably around the low to mid levels of the tower due to the low levels of the wolves. </p><p>\"[Location]\" She commanded. </p><p>[Snow Forest Dungeon 2F] </p><p>\"Snow Forest? Doesn\'t that mean my magic would be weak to the dungeon boss?\" Shiro said seeing the location. Even if she did spend all of her points to focus around her Nanomancer class, using a cold weapon such as a dagger would do minimal damage to the boss. Heck, unless she creates a gun, she wouldn\'t be able to use her Nanomancer class to clear dungeons. </p><p>\"No! This missy has just received a second chance. I refuse to be trapped in this dungeon… wait. Since I\'m a Snow Girl am I a monster spawned in the dungeon?\" She paused in realisation. </p><p>\"Can I even get out? Killing the boss means a dungeon reset. A dungeon reset means wiping all the monsters before restoring them again. Wiping all the monsters means also wiping me out. ARG! HOW DO I LEAVE!\" Shiro shouted in frustration. She had just been given her seco- no third chance if you included her escape from the facility. How could she let a dungeon lock her down? </p><p class=\"uaxrxm\"></p><p>Though it seems like her shout had attracted unwanted attention. Or would it be wanted since she was needing food anyways. </p><p>More wolves seemed to have appeared as Shiro turned towards them. </p><p>\"Come here Mr Wolves. This missy is just a harmless lady.\" She smiled softly. Though the scent of blood on her just made the wolves bare their teeth. </p><p>\'Why aren\'t they attacking yet?\' Shiro thought since they seemed to be wary about something. </p><p>She decided to turn around and run before \'tripping\' over nothing. </p><p>\"Aiya~ I\'ve tripped. How can I run away~\" She said peaking over at the wolves who did nothing. </p><p>\"Seriously?! You did nothing?\" Shiro said and she crossed her legs. </p><p>She seemed to have gained an idea as she waved her hand around before laying on her back. </p><p>\"Since you mutts don\'t want to attack, this missy will sleep. I need some bodyguards anyways.\" She said closing her eyes. </p><p class=\"uaxrxm\"></p><p>[MP: 250/600] </p><p>During her wait, she heard the sounds of flesh being ripped causing her opened her eyes to five wolves being impaled by the traps she set down earlier. </p><p>She wasn\'t afraid of them not working since she had already tested out the traps on the first batch of wolves. The only downside to this was how much MP it would use. It was a combination of spells which when combined, expressed more potential than normal Tier 1 spells. </p><p>The idea of combining spells was learnt during her time in the hero\'s party. Even though her Nanomancer class didn\'t need it, the mage had always said it was better to learn as much as you could in case of unexpected situations. </p><p>Looking through the hearts of the five wolves, she found a single piece of Mana stone the size of a pinkie. </p><p>Throwing the piece in her mouth, she chewed it as she found the taste similar to candy. </p><p>Licking her lips, she couldn\'t help but complain at the low drop rate of the mana stone. </p><p>\"[Collect]\" She said once more causing the wolves\' bodies disintegrated. This time she made sure to drink every last drop of the mana. </p><p>Scrapping the miscellaneous items once more, she gained 50 USD. </p><p class=\"uaxrxm\"></p><p>[Name: Shiro </p><p>Race: Snow Girl (Evolution Criteria yet to be met) </p><p>Level: 3-&gt;4 </p><p>Class: Snow Girl, Nanomancer </p><p>HP: 250/250 </p><p>MP: 430/600 </p><p>STR: 10 </p><p>VIT: 10 </p><p>INT: 35 </p><p class=\"uaxrxm\"></p><p>AGI: 30 </p><p>DEX: 15 </p><p>DEF: 10 </p><p>Unassigned Points: 5 </p><p>Balance: 80 USD] </p><p>Each level up from 1 to 20 gave a person 5 points.

It is also at level 20 when a person would get their first class up. At the class up, they would start to gain a certain amount of passive points per level which shows you which area you want to place your focus in. </p><p>Plugging the points into areas she knows she would have to place her attention on, Shiro nodded at her stats. </p><p>[Name: Shiro </p><p>Race: Snow Girl (Evolution Criteria yet to be met) </p><p class=\"uaxrxm\"></p><p>Level: 4 </p><p>Class: Snow Girl, Nanomancer </p><p>HP: 250/350 </p><p>MP: 480/650 </p><p>STR: 11 </p><p>VIT: 11 </p><p>INT: 36 </p><p>AGI: 32 </p><p>DEX: 15 </p><p class=\"uaxrxm\"></p><p>DEF: 10 </p><p>Unassigned Points: 0 </p><p>Balance: 80 USD] </p><p>Dusting herself, she looked around for a temporary home as camping in a dungeon wasn\'t uncommon. Therefore, the knowledge about how to camp safely was required to be learned. </p><p>Due to a lack of resources, as well as the fact that she can\'t be bothered. Shiro decided to perch herself on a tree. </p><p>Hugging the tallest branch, she looked for the obelisk. The obelisk was a panel which allowed you to either climb higher into the tower or lower. </p><p>Her aim was to see if she can leave this dungeon as it was disadvantageous for her class to combat the boss. </p><div class=\"adsbox\"></div><p>\"Found it.\" Shiro smiled seeing the tower towards her left. </p><p>The tower seemed to be made from a matt black material as the neon green lights made it stand out against the surroundings. When the light is red, it means you cannot use the obelisk. There are a few situations concerning the inability to use the obelisk. The most common being a boss fight. Unless the party is dead or the boss is dead, they wouldn\'t be able to use the obelisk. </p><p class=\"uaxrxm\"></p><p>Due to the lighting getting darker, the monsters become more frenzied. Therefore travelling to the obelisk right now would be a bad choice. </p><p>Laying her back on the branch, Shiro looked up at the starless sky. Her peaceful aura made her seem profound right now as if she was thinking about something deep. Something that would make a person question the very meaning of life. </p><p>\'I wonder if I can eat a wolf should I cook it, though it seems like I\'m living off mana instead.\' </p><p>...or not. </p><p>Monster meat can be collected and cooked. Though without sufficient storage, most would just choose to [collect] the drops as the body would disintegrate. </p><p>There are benefits to monster meat, some grants temporary buffs to stats whilst some were poisonous. </p><p>There were some monster meat that even granted permanent increments to one\'s stats such as dragon flesh which increases DEF, STR, AGI and VIT. Which is why every part of a high-ranking monster was precious and should be harvested without failure. Though raw flesh would be more harmful than beneficial. </p><p>Naturally, humanoid monsters didn\'t escape this fate either. Snow Woman flesh seemed to grant a significant increase to one\'s INT. That being said, female humanoid monsters like the Snow Woman were also used as high quality \'stress relief\' for the high-level adventurers. </p><p>Shiro wasn\'t unfamiliar as she has seen humans mating with a humanoid monster weaker than them. </p><p>The most common monsters to mate with were beings such as Elves and Female Beast kin who retain more human features than beast. </p><p>But due to the uncomfortable terminology of monster\'s, they were more widely accepted as Demi-Humans or lesser humans. </p><p>Looking at her arm, Shiro couldn\'t help but wonder if someone would try to eat her. Both figuratively and literally. </p><p>\'If they try to \'eat\' me, freezing their crotch and crushing them should do the trick.\' Shiro thought with slight humour but understood the consequences of being caught when she is still weak. </p><p>Setting a few traps around her, Shiro closed her eyes as she fell asleep. </p>'),(211,10,'Chapter 2 Leader Class',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Standing atop the tree, Shiro looked around to find some easy prey for breakfast. </p><p>\"Bear, level 10. Bear, level 8. Bear, level 15.\" Shiro muttered seeing a few bears roam around. </p><p>She wanted to look around for a few wolves but it seems like they\'ve moved territories as the Bears invaded the local area. </p><p>The main reason for migration would be due to a stronger monster spawning or a leader class monster expanding its territory. </p><p>Monsters have classes within their ranks as well. These go from [No Class], [Rare Class], [Elite Class], [General Class], [Vice Leader Class], [Leader Class], [Noble Class], [King Class] and so on. The rest wasn\'t important for now. </p><p>Shiro was currently a [No Class] type monster. </p><p>The Class is set up in a way that a D rank [No Class] could most likely defeat an E rank [General Class] with relative ease. The higher the ranks, the more this disparity becomes. An S rank [No Class] could clean its ass with a B ranked [King Class] monster. </p><p>That being said, being awarded a [-Class] is a feat in itself. A class is only awarded when the monster undergoes a mutation after reaching the peak of their class. For example, if Shiro underwent a mutation of her Snow Girl class at the peak of level 20, she would gain a [Rare Class] or an [Elite Class]. Though it would only happen if she doesn\'t Class Up. When she does, the [Class] would then disappear. </p><p>Rubbing her stomach, Shiro decided to hunt at least one bear to fill her stomach up before leaving. </p><p>Walking around carefully, Shiro make sure to single out a low-level Bear. </p><p class=\"tlyjip\"></p><p>[Bear LVL 6 – Empowered] </p><p>\"Oh damn. There really is a leader class here on the 2nd floor.\" Shiro muttered seeing the status of the bear. </p><p>Empowered meant that the monster was getting a buff from the leader class monster. A LVL 6 empowered bear would be roughly the same as a LVL 12 or 13 normal bear. </p><p>\'Can I defeat him? Hmm….\' Shiro thought as she needed to be careful. She was just a harmless LVL 4 Snow Girl right now. Neither her mana nor stats allowed for her to be ballsy to challenge an Empowered bear. Not that she has any balls to begin with. They belonged to males. </p><p>\'Nope. This missy is outta here.\' She thought and decided to retreat. Maybe if she was a LVL 10 Snow Girl, she may stand a chance. </p><p>Ignoring her hunger, she treaded carefully to not draw the aggression/aggro of the monsters whilst moving towards the obelisk. </p><p>Though the situation made her want to cry. The frequency of high-level Empowered bears became more common the closer she went. Meaning the Leader class bear took refuge near the obelisk. </p><p>\'Can I not get a break?!\' Shiro thought in her mind as she had to keep quiet or else her life would be forfeited. </p><p>Retracing her steps, she returned to the outer circle of the bear territory. </p><p class=\"tlyjip\"></p><p>\'If I kill a few wolves and level up, I should be able to sneak past or at least survive long enough to use the obelisk.\' Shiro thought, making her target for now; Reach level 10 and kill a few bears. </p><p>### </p><p>It took her 3 days to level up to LVL 10 as not only did the Bear\'s territory increase causing her to slow down, but the number of Wolves she needed to kill to level up once increased as well. </p><p>However, she had to bear it for the sake of survival. </p><p>But her hard work paid off as she felt slightly confident to fight against the lowest level Empowered Bear. </p><p>[Name: Shiro </p><p>Race: Snow Girl (Evolution Criteria yet to be met) </p><p>Level: 4-&gt;10 </p><p>Class: Snow Girl, Nanomancer </p><p class=\"tlyjip\"></p><p>HP: 550/550 </p><p>MP: 1200/1200 </p><p>STR: 11-&gt;15 </p><p>VIT: 11-&gt;20 </p><p>INT: 36-&gt;45 </p><p>AGI: 32-&gt;40 </p><p>DEX: 15 </p><p>DEF: 10 </p><p>Unassigned Points: 0 </p><p class=\"tlyjip\"></p><p>Balance: 2300 USD] </p><p>There was another benefit to killing the wolves to reach LVL 10. She had managed to gain a few item drops from the wolves. Though some were downright useless. </p><p>A person has six main equipment slots. Head, Shoulders, Chest, Arms, Pants and Feet. In addition of the six main slots, there are a few minor slots. To name a few would be, Earring, Rings, Necklace, Crown, Bracelets and so on. </p><p>Whilst there wasn\'t a limit to how many accessories one can have, the more accessories a person wears the faster they break. This was due to the fact that the mana gathered around the accessories would repel one another. With too many, the mana damaging each accessory increases causing them to break faster. The best combination so far would be two earrings/two rings, a necklace and two bracelets. </p><p>Shiro\'s current equipment was: </p><p>[Helmet – None </p><p>Shoulder – Wolf Light Guards </p><p>Wolf Light guards (White) LVL 5 </p><p>+5 INT </p><p class=\"tlyjip\"></p><p>Chest – Wolf Light Armour </p><p>Wolf Light Armour (White) LVL 5 </p><p>+5 INT </p><p>+2 DEF </p><p>Arms – None </p><p>Pants – Wolf Light Pants </p><p>Wolf Light Pants (White) LVL 5 </p><p>+10 AGI </p><p>Feet – None] </p><p class=\"tlyjip\"></p><p>She only chose these pieces since the others would hinder her speed too much. That and also most of them didn\'t suit her since they were either heavy pieces of armour or the stat bonuses brought more negative than positives. One being the Wolf Heavy Guard. It was a piece of green equipment but the -10 SPD and the +10 DEF would destroy her current balancing. It was more effective for a tanker but not for her. </p><p>As for the Equipment Grade colours, they go from: White -&gt; Green -&gt; Blue -&gt; Purple -&gt; Orange -&gt; Red -&gt; Black -&gt; Rainbow. </p><p>In her loadout, she was also missing a few pieces of equipment since she didn\'t receive them. Wolves were more of a low-level grind mob that helped low-level people to get stronger. No other purposes. Therefore, getting a few drops from them were pretty lucky. </p><p>Bears on the other hand… </p><p>Shiro smiled thinking about the potential drops. </p><p>Her current stats with the boost of her equipment was: </p><p>[Name: Shiro </p><p>Race: Snow Girl (Evolution Criteria yet to be met) </p><p>Level: 10 </p><p class=\"tlyjip\"></p><p>Class: Snow Girl, Nanomancer </p><p>HP: 550/550 </p><p>MP: 1700/1700 (1200+500) </p><p>STR: 15 </p><p>VIT: 20 </p><p>INT: 45 (+10) </p><p>AGI: 40 (+10) </p><p>DEX: 15 </p><p>DEF: 10 (+2) </p><p class=\"tlyjip\"></p><p>Unassigned Points: 0 </p><p>Balance: 2300 USD] </p><p>()= Equipment Bonus </p><p>The equipment wasn\'t visible since it had three options.

But it wasn\'t too bad since she probably wouldn\'t be able to make use of it in the first place. </p><p>Stalking her prey, Shiro waited for the LVL 5 bear to be far enough away from the rest before striking. </p><p>Her goal was simple, strike the weak point. </p><p>Unfortunately, the weak point was the anus. </p><p class=\"tlyjip\"></p><p>The Bear seemed to sense danger as it wanted to turn around and fight the danger. However, the spear was already travelling up its ass. </p><p>Shiro made sure to run around the Bear before making a block of ice to stop the Bear\'s screams from reaching the other monsters. </p><p>\"Hush Mr Bear. Just a little anal probe!\" Shiro shouted quietly as she used Ice to trap the Bear down. </p><p>The Bear thrashed around wildly causing the Ice to show signs of breaking. </p><p>\"Come on, just a little further.\" Shiro said as she hopped behind the Bear and continued to push the spear. </p><p>The Bear seemed to have gained a sudden boost, clenching its anus and snapped the Ice Spear in half. </p><p>*CKK!!! </p><p>The Ice broke as well freeing the Bear.

Naturally, with a D rank adventurer being 5 times more powerful than average men could only mean those higher up in the ranks were monster amongst men. </p><p>They could sneeze and accidentally kill you. </p><p class=\"tlyjip\"></p><p>While she was almost three times as strong as average men, Shiro knew any random D rank adventurer could swat her to death. </p><p>Standing up, Shiro smiled seeing the three bears leave. </p><p>Targeting another low-level Bear, Shiro jumped across the trees as she would occasionally swing on a branch to increase her distance travelled. Since she is a Snow Girl, she also had the choice of floating, but that would take quite a bit of MP per second and not worth it in this moment of time. </p><p>[Bear LVL 7 – Empowered] </p><p>Silently forming another spear, Shiro grinned before she took aim towards the anus of the bear. </p><p>Mana gathered in her palms as the spear shot towards the ass. </p><p>However, luck was not on her side since the bear stood up in this moment resulting in the spear hitting the hide and shattering. </p><p>The Bear\'s head swivelled towards her location causing Shiro to pause feeling the anger rising in the Bear. </p><p>\"I\'m sorry?\" Shiro apologised with a twitching smile. This fight could have been much easier if the bear didn\'t suddenly stand up. </p><p class=\"tlyjip\"></p><p>*WRAAAANNN!!!! </p><p>The Bear roared, alerting the nearby Bears as Shiro quickly turned and ran with all her might. </p><p>\'Oh hell no.\' She thought in her head. She didn\'t dare to look back. </p><p>The previous fight seemed easy as she had made sure to target the weak points of the anus and the mouth. But if she aimed for the hide, then not only would it deal minimal damage, it would also incur the bear\'s wrath. But that\'s not to say that probing the bear wouldn\'t. </p><p>Quickly thinking up a solution, Shiro dashed towards the Wolves with four Bears chasing behind her. </p><p>She didn\'t need to see their tag to realise they were Enraged. Just their roars gave her a hint. </p><p>It didn\'t take long for Shiro to reach the Wolves since she understood their pattern over the course of the few days she took to hunt them down. </p><p>Allowing the Wolves and the Bears to fight, Shiro escaped. </p><p>The sounds of combat and roars rang out behind her as she sighed in relief. </p><p class=\"tlyjip\"></p><p>\'Sorry Mr Wolf.

A LVL 20 [Leader Class] Bear should be roughly a LVL 30 to LVL 40 [No Class] Bear monster.\' Shiro thought when she realised that this meant the Ice Elemental Bear was akin to a Low/Mid-Level D Rank monster.</p><p>\'No wonder he took half my HP with a missed attack.\' She thought in relief that the paw missed. If it hit, it would definitely kill her in one swat.</p><p class=\"yfflrf\"></p><p>\'This miss has been hit by a variety of attacks. I refuse to be killed like a fly!\' Shiro thought in her mind as she stood up. She wanted to leave the Dungeon as soon as possible.</p><p>The gate of a Dungeon was as it says. A giant gate. It wasn\'t too hard to spot since a giant set of doors could be seen not too far from her.</p><p>Walking towards the door, Shiro could see the engravings on the door itself.</p><p>\"Bears, Wolves, Ice Elementals… Just a typical E rank Dungeon huh?\" She muttered as the gates of a Dungeon would give people some idea of what was inside the Dungeon itself.</p><p>Seeing movement on the doors, Shiro became vigilant as she quickly hid behind some trees and looked at the gate opening with narrowed eyes.</p><p>A party of 5 appeared and they seemed to be novices since their equipment was rather sub-par. The aura they emitted gave Shiro no danger either as she understands she could probably kill them easily in a 1V1.</p><p>*CRRRRR</p><p>The doors slowly closed when the party of five entered. They were chatting without care as if they were having a picnic.</p><p>\"!!!!\" Her attention was drawn away when she saw movement on the door.</p><p class=\"yfflrf\"></p><p>The initial carvings and images shifted as they morphed and the overall picture changed.</p><p>Dungeon Mutation.</p><p>There was a low chance of a Dungeon Mutation happening since it would change the Dungeons fundamentals. Out of a hundred Dungeons, there would probably be one or two that would mutate.</p><p>Right now, the dungeon was changing as an orange light appeared in the centre of the forest.</p><p>[Dungeon Mutation Occurred]</p><p>[Current Location – Fire Elementals Charred Forest 1F]</p><p>[Rank – E+/D-]</p><p>\'Fire Elementals? Lucky for me.\' Shiro thought with a smile, this meant her Ice would actually do something. She could probably grind for a few levels and maybe challenge the Ice Elemental Bear. Or rather a Fire Elemental Bear due to the mutation.</p><p>One question remained in her mind though.</p><p class=\"yfflrf\"></p><p>\'Why wasn\'t I affected?\' She thought.</p><p>\'Could it be that I\'m technically not a part of this Dungeon? So if they beat the Dungeon and the Dungeon wipe occurs I should be safe from it… Let\'s not gamble for now.\' She thought as her hypothesis could be wrong and erase her ass from the face of this Dungeon.</p><p>The party of five seem to be panicking too since they hit the door a few times but it refused to budge.</p><p>Sneaking closer to them, Shiro wanted to see if she could gather some information about where she was and which time period.</p><p>Peaking her head out slightly, she exposed her two azure eyes as she glanced over.</p><p>The scout seemed to have noticed something since he shot an arrow towards where she was.</p><p>\"Ah!\" Shiro was surprised at how they shot without warning. Quickly ducking, she looked at the arrow embedded into the tree.</p><p>\'How rude!\' She thought, turning back to the group.</p><p>[Xin Feng– LVL 15 – Swordsman]</p><p class=\"yfflrf\"></p><p>[Jin – LVL 14 – Archer]</p><p>[Clare – LVL 15 – Priest]</p><p>[Bonney – LVL 14 – Assassin]</p><p>[Trevor – LVL 18 – Guardian]</p><p>They took their positions with Trevor at the front, Xin Feng and Bonney behind him.

Her instincts were kicking in since she wasn\'t the strongest person in her previous life for nothing.</p><p>Mid-roll, she aimed her palm as a Tier 1 Ice bullet shot towards the Assassin.</p><p>The assassin was hit, but her body flashed with a white light healing her up.</p><p>\"Tsk.\" Shiro clicked her tongue before she retreated back into the forest. A group fight was disadvantageous for her right now. They were weaker than her if she fought them 1 on 1 but this was currently a 5 v 1.</p><p>She landed on a branch and quickly stabilised herself.</p><p>Looking at the five who were vigilant against her, an idea entered her mind as she gave them a provocative sneer.</p><p>###</p><p>This was supposed to be our graduation exam.

We don\'t want to be ambushed near the entrance.\" I called out to my long-time friends.</p><p>\"I know I know.\" Jin, our scout, replied.</p><p>Our group talked for a little while but we froze when we felt the mana jump.</p><p>\"Feng! This Dungeon is mutating!\" Clare shouted out whilst me and Trevor tried to open the door but failed.</p><p>\"We\'ll have to wait for the teachers to send in D ranked members or higher to pry this door open.\" I said with a frown. The situation wasn\'t looking too great but we could survive as long as we hold our ground and wait for rescue. Some would try to clear the Dungeon but we knew better.</p><p>Mutated Dungeons meant the monsters became stronger so it would be suicidal to try to proceed without ample preparation.</p><p>Only when there were no other options would a party try clear one unprepared.</p><p>Jin seemed to have picked up a monster because he shot towards the location where the monster was.</p><p>\"Ah!\"</p><p class=\"yfflrf\"></p><p>We heard a soft voice cry out in surprise as we became vigilant.</p><p>[Shiro – LVL 16 – Snow Girl]</p><p>[HP: 1200/1200]</p><p>[MP:1950/1950]</p><p>A named monster!</p><p>There were instances where a monster would be named.

Jin launched another arrow to see if he could hit her.</p><p class=\"yfflrf\"></p><p>Dodging backwards, she opened her mouth as she started to talk but all we heard were wordless echoes.</p><p>\"Feng, I think she might be an intelligent monster.\" Trevor said with a frown.</p><p>\"I think so as well.\" I replied. This would make the fight harder because she could very well lure us into a trap.</p><p>Trevor charged towards her with Shield Bash in hopes of stunning her. However, what he hit was a block of Ice as Bonney quickly tried to stab her so Trevor would be safe.</p><p>The Snow Girl rolled on her side before firing an Ice Bullet at Bonney. Clare didn\'t dawdle as she quickly healed Bonney up.</p><p>\"Jesus, it\'s like fighting an instructor.\" Bonney said with a frown whilst we looked at the Snow Girl standing on the branch.</p><p>\"Isn\'t a Snow Girl supposed to be a weak E rank monster?\" Trevor said keeping his guard up.</p><p>\"But this one is a named monster. We can\'t judge named monsters with the same logic.\" I replied as my friends nodded gravely.</p><p>The Snow Girl seemed to pause for a moment before flashing a provocative sneer. She turned around and disappeared into the forest leaving us here.</p><p class=\"yfflrf\"></p><p>\"Hmm… Don\'t follow. Even if she does bring reinforcements, we need to wait for the teachers.\" I said as my friends agreed. Chasing after her would bring us more danger.</p><p>###</p><p>\"They didn\'t follow?\" Shiro muttered seeing the five not following her.</p><p>\"And here I thought they were greenhorns. Seems like they know the more important basics.\" She said sitting down on the branch.</p><p>\"Hmm… current goals, current goals. Number 1 – Reach LVL 20.

Though not as intended, it should work like a charm on you.\" Shiro said with a grin. </p><p>Two daggers formed in both her hands as they had neon blue veins travelling down the blade. The Daggers took 1000MP each which would be fine if she was higher level. But right now, each dagger was just a little under a third of her total MP. </p><p>[Nano Crafted Ice Dagger (Blue) – LVL 18 </p><p>+10 Piercing </p><p>+10 Sharpness </p><p class=\"ndxajd\"></p><p>+10 Ice Element </p><p>Durability – Until stored MP runs out </p><p>MP – 1000/1000] </p><p>*RAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!! </p><p>The Golem cried out causing molten rocks to separate from its back and shoot towards her. </p><p>Sidestepping some of the rocks, Shiro frowned seeing her HP drop a little due to the slight AOE(Area Of Effect). </p><p>[HP: 1750/1900] </p><p>As the two large boulders shot towards her, Shiro twirled both daggers in her hands before throwing them towards the rocks. </p><p>When the daggers hit the rocks, Shiro clenched her fist as Ice started to spread outwards from the daggers. </p><p class=\"ndxajd\"></p><p>During her time hunting the Fire element monsters back on the first floor, she had managed to combine both classes together in some instances such as now. </p><p>When crafting the Dagger, Shiro inserted Tier 1 magic in the centre which made the Dagger akin to a grenade that can be detonated at any moment she wants. </p><p>The sudden contrast of temperature created through her Ice caused the boulders to explode due to Thermal Shock. As the boulders exploded, Shiro flexed her fingers causing the daggers to fly back into her hands as if they were magnetised. </p><p>Running towards the Golem with narrowed eyes, she threw one of her daggers at the face. </p><p>Seemingly understanding the danger the daggers possess, the Golem made a small rock to counter the dagger. </p><p>Shiro took its reaction into account as her second dagger shot towards the leg. </p><p>Stabbing the leg of the Golem, Shiro didn\'t combust the dagger but instead used it as a foothold. </p><p>Jumping up, she grabbed the first dagger then twisted her body before she stabbed it into the Golems chest. </p><p>Combusting both daggers, the force sent the Golem stumbling backwards as Shiro landed lightly.

Opening its mouth, fire element surged towards it and a ball of fire was being created. </p><p>\"Ah right. A breath attack.\" Shiro said as she remembered most Elemental Type [Elite Class] or higher monsters were capable of breathing out a breath of their respective elements. </p><p>Quickly utilising the float passive of Snow Girls, she avoided the fire breath. </p><p>Her breathing fluctuated due to her being so close to the fire.

With her AGI reaching 65 points, she was three times as fast as an average human a.d.u.l.t. </p><p>The daggers unhinged themselves as Shiro caught them in mid-air. Turning her body without slowing down a single bit, she threw the daggers back into the face of the Golem with increased momentum. </p><p>Making three Ice Spears, she threw two which locked down on the Golems legs whilst the last one hit the cranium. </p><p>The force caused the Golem to open its mouth as the two daggers entered inside. </p><p>\"Goodbye~\" Shiro grinned as she detonated the daggers. This time she made sure the daggers would use every last drop of MP stored inside them to give the Golem a devastating blow. </p><p>*BOOOOMMM!!!!! </p><p>The explosion of Ice shot into the air causing Shiro to whistle at the impact. </p><p>The fire that came from the Golem died down, signalling her about the Golems death. </p><p>\"Hehehe~ Loot loot my loot~\" She sung lightly as she jogged towards the body of the Golem. </p><p class=\"ndxajd\"></p><p>Rummaging through the rocks, she found the Mana stone the size of two fingers. </p><p>Lifting the stone above her face, she peered through the stone as it seemed like the stone held a ball of fire inside. </p><p>Unable to contain her grin, she threw the stone into her mouth and smiled blissfully at the taste. </p><p>The stone had a sweet outer shell with the taste of oranges. Once you get past the outer shell, a jelly-like inner area welcomed her as a burst of flavour exploded in her mouth. </p><p>Giggling slightly, Shiro enjoyed the Mana Stone slowly whilst she collected her bounty. </p><p>[Fire Giant\'s Shield (Green) LVL 15] </p><p>[Fire Spirit\'s Ring (Blue) LVL 15] </p><p>[Fire Giant\'s Greaves (Green) LVL 15] </p><p>[Fire Giant\'s Guard (Green) LVL 15] </p><p class=\"ndxajd\"></p><p>[Fire Giant\'s Titanus Cleaver (Blue) LVL 15] </p><p>[Fire Source Stone x10] </p><p>[Fire Stone Dust x42] </p><p>[Fire Giant Essence x1] </p><p>[Red Gem x3] </p><p>[2000 USD] </p><p>\"Oh my, three green drops and two blue drops.

The muscle fibres were pulsing as they tried to join back together but failed. </p><p>*WRRAAAANNNN!!!! </p><p>The Bear roared in madness, charging towards Shiro. </p><p>Jumping onto the tree branch, Shiro jumped once more as she landed behind the Bear. </p><p>The Bear didn\'t turn around as the flames on his back grew larger. </p><p class=\"wtgwgk\"></p><p>Creating a block of Ice, Shiro hopped backwards whilst she saw the Ice block melt in mere seconds. </p><p>Raising both her arms slightly, two Ice Spears materialised as she threw them both towards the Bear. </p><p>After throwing the spears, she quickly created a third spear. </p><p>With a slight delay, she twisted her body and threw the third spear with all of her might. </p><p>The first two spears were aimed towards the arms of the Bear as the last one was aimed towards the chest. </p><p>*CRR CRR!!! </p><p>The first two spears made contacts and froze over instantly, locking both arms into the ground. </p><p>The last spear made contact as well. However, fire erupted around the Bear as he covered his entire body in a mass of flames. </p><p>\"Shiro frowned seeing her plan go out the window. </p><p class=\"wtgwgk\"></p><p>The Bear roared, sending tens of fireballs hurling towards her. </p><p>Freezing the ground beneath her feet, Shiro started to skate around as her agility helped increase her momentum. </p><p>*BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOOM!!!! </p><p>Most of the fireballs missed but for the odd few which were on target, Shiro created her own Ice Bullet as it cancelled each other out. </p><p>Shiro narrowed her eyes whilst she crouched down and started to manually construct a ramp. </p><p>Under the paw, through the legs, around the back, over the head. </p><p>A roller coaster seemed to have been created as Shiro manoeuvred around the Bear causing it to not be able to lock onto her. </p><p>Little by little, an orb of Ice formed around the bear. Seeing the orb of Ice completed, Shiro made a ramp straight up. </p><p>Making two spears, she threw both of them with a slight gap between them. </p><p class=\"wtgwgk\"></p><p>The first spear was countered with a fire breath whilst the second one took its place. </p><p>Bringing her hands together, Shiro controlled the Ice Orb she created and fused it together with the second spear. This caused the weight of the spear to increase dramatically as it crushed the bear beneath it. </p><p>Not allowing it a moments rest, Shiro made a Nano Dagger and tried to decapitate the Bear whilst it couldn\'t retaliate. </p><p>She frowned as she saw the dagger fail to cut deeply into the neck. </p><p>\"Che, we\'ll do this the hard way then big guy.\" Shiro said as she flicked her wrist and a second dagger materialised. </p><p>Stabbing the dagger through the tongue and jaw of the Bear, she froze it in place to make sure it couldn\'t move. </p><p>Making one more dagger, she twirled them both as she cut away at the face of the Bear. Layer by layer, the Bear\'s cries became more painful. </p><p>It tried to thrash around crazily but Shiro kept a constant supply of mana to the Ice locking the Bear down. This prevented the Bear from leaving since the Ice always regenerated. </p><p>The Bear had also tried to coat his body with fire, but the Ice was mostly concentrated near Shiro so it didn\'t melt as easily. He could only suffer while Shiro slowly killed it. </p><p class=\"wtgwgk\"></p><p>After a few minutes of constant attacking with her two daggers, Shiro panted heavily seeing the Bear finally die. </p><p>The skull of the Bear had lost most of its flesh as Shiro scr.a.p.ed it to the bone and destroyed the brain. </p><p>\"Pui! What a pain.\" Shiro said spitting out some blood that got into her mouth. </p><p>Standing up, she dismissed the ice. Carving a hole through the torso leading to where the heart would be, Shiro frowned when she realised she couldn\'t reach it due to her small arm length. </p><p>\"Ha….\" She sighed with fatigue as she brought up her two daggers and carved away. </p><p>After digging for a while, she finally saw the heart. The heart itself was roughly two-fifths of her body size. </p><p>Rummaging around in the heart, she pulled out a Mana Stone the size of a large chicken egg. </p><p>\"[Collect]\" </p><p>The body disappeared and Shiro drank as much mana as she could. </p><p class=\"wtgwgk\"></p><p>Looking over at the list of loot, Shiro couldn\'t help but nod and appreciate the reward. At least it was worth her efforts. </p><p>Rewards consisted of a bunch of miscellaneous items fit for blacksmiths, pharmacists and alchemists. It also included several pieces of armour which were mostly (Blue) Ranked and a single Lucky Skill Stone. </p><p>Selling the miscellaneous items, she recycled the equipment she didn\'t need. </p><p>The equipment that remained were: </p><p>[Fire Spirit Infused Power Gauntlet (Blue) LVL20 </p><p>+20 STR </p><p>+15 VIT </p><p>-10 AGI </p><p>Skill – Power Boost </p><p class=\"wtgwgk\"></p><p>Power Boost – +100% damage, +15 STR, +30% Damage Taken </p><p>Duration – 20 Seconds </p><p>Cool Down – 5 Minutes] </p><p>[Empowered Fire Bear Guards (Blue) LVL20 </p><p>+20 DEF </p><p>+15 VIT </p><p>+ 5 STR] </p><p>[Fire Spirit Empowered Hammer (Blue) LVL20 </p><p>Requirements: 60 STR </p><p class=\"wtgwgk\"></p><p>+30 Blunt Damage </p><p>+15 Momentum Boost </p><p>+15 Fire Element </p><p>-10 Attack Speed </p><p>Passive Skill – Reduced Weight </p><p>Reduced Weight – Reduces the Weight of the weapon by 30%.] </p><p>The passive skill of the hammer was impressive as it would help counter the -10 Attack Speed. Shiro decided to save the hammer until she outgrew the level since it may help her. Recycling it right now would just be a waste of loot and might cause her to regret it later. </p><p>Turning her attention to the Lucky Skill Stone, she couldn\'t help but put on a slightly bitter face. </p><p>[Lucky Skill Stone (Purple) – Disguise </p><p class=\"wtgwgk\"></p><p>Disguise – Disguise your status from under any peeking eye. </p><p>Cost – 100MP upon activation.

Was she supposed to be happy or sad? </p><p>She got a skill she needed but on the other hand, she wasted such a good item. It was akin to spending a million gold to buy a loaf of bread. </p><p>\'Be grateful for what you get I guess?\' She thought, crushing the stone and learnt the skill. </p><p>She checked her total stats with her new equipment included. </p><p>[Name: Shiro </p><p>Race: Snow Girl (Evolution Criteria yet to be met) </p><p class=\"wtgwgk\"></p><p>Title – [Elite Class] </p><p>Title Bonus - +10 In every stat </p><p>Level: 20 </p><p>Class: Snow Girl, Nanomancer </p><p>HP: 1430/3800 </p><p>MP: 20/4800 </p><p>STR: 35 (+25) +10 Title Bonus </p><p>VIT: 30 (+40) +10 Title Bonus </p><p>INT: 55 -&gt; 60 (+50) +10 Title Bonus </p><p class=\"wtgwgk\"></p><p>AGI: 50 (+5) +10 Title Bonus </p><p>DEX: 21 +10 Title Bonus </p><p>DEF: 10 (+32) +10 Title Bonus </p><p>Unassigned Points: 5-&gt;0 </p><p>Balance: 20,100 USD </p><p>Equipment: (Tap to display)] </p><p>Through killing the [Leader Class] Bear, she had managed to pseudo level up once.

Towards the back of the room, a towering throne could be seen as a figure sat on the throne with an air of nonchalance. </p><p>It had black armour with neon orange highlights.

Teleport shrines were naturally erected buildings as they provided a waypoint for people to use as transportation. </p><p>The teleport shrines were usually in the shape of a great tree hundreds of times bigger than people. There would be an obelisk-like object inside the teleport shine as it would allow a person to choose which teleport shine they wanted to go to. </p><p>However, the range of teleportation was limited to what you\'ve already discovered. Example being if there were two shrines at point A and B respectively. If you haven\'t discovered point B, then you won\'t be able to teleport to that shrine. But there is a way to bypass this. </p><p>There are two main options and those are; Link and party. Link is when two shrines becomes linked to each other meaning even if you haven\'t discovered the shrine, you would be able to teleport. The other was party, this is when the party leader teleports everyone in the party. This however, was then limited by the shrines the party leader himself/herself had been too. </p><p>What confused Shiro the most was why she could use it as well. She\'s never heard of a monster being able to use the teleport shrine so she was surprised. And here she was, being prepared to be dropped in the middle of a forest outside the Dungeon. </p><p>Looking around her, she saw that there were a few people patrolling around. Just from the vibes they gave her, she knew they should be mid to top class D rank roughly LVL50. </p><p>Her appearance surprised a few people as she was a gorgeous young girl. Her height and face gave them the idea that she was roughly 13 to 16 in age. She looked around with both curiosity and nervousness making people believe that she was lost. </p><p>Not wanting to hold the line up, Shiro walked out of the teleport shrine. She was shocked at the different architecture that was visible before her. Both the language and building type was different from the one she was used too. </p><p>She could understand what the people around her was saying, but she can\'t speak nor could she read their language. </p><p>\'My priority should be learning about where I am at this current moment in time. But I also need to be able to communicate.\' She thought as she sought out one of the patrolmen. </p><p class=\"phxfap\"></p><p>[Liam LVL46 – Knight] </p><p>\"Mn? Hello miss, how can I help?\" He asked with a smile. </p><p>Shiro opened her mouth to speak but no words came out.

Can you read?\" He asked as she shook her head. </p><p>\'How the hell did she live her life till now.\' He thought. </p><p class=\"phxfap\"></p><p>\"Are you lost?\" He asked. </p><p>Shiro shook her head but then decided to nod it. She wasn\'t lost directional sense wise, but she didn\'t know which city she was in. </p><p>\"Do you know where your parents are?\" He asked again as she shook her head. </p><p>\"Do you know who your parents are?\" </p><p>She shook her head again. </p><p>\'Hmm… I\'ll take her to the guild for now. Maybe they can find out her background.\' </p><p>\"Liam Wilford Calling in, is anyone free right now?\" He asked over a device. </p><p>-This is Jason Mathews. I\'m currently free. - </p><p>\"Are you able to take my patrol for now? I\'ve got a girl here who doesn\'t know who her parents are. She\'s mute, can\'t read nor write. But she can understand people.

Seeing her nod, he took it as a cue and started to point at a few shops. </p><p>\"The shops in this district is civilian clothing. They deal with clothes that don\'t contain any sort of benefit. Civilian clothing if you will. We have the food court, the market….\" Liam continued to explain as most of the shops in this area was for civilians. </p><p>\"And now from here on we have the facilities aimed towards adventurers. </p><p>\"We have the Alchemist/Pharmacist association who deals with anything potion related.

They deal with anything weapon and armour related. </p><p>\"And finally, the Adventurer\'s Guild. They deal with anything adventurer related.

Naturally not every adventurer since a few would opt out of this. </p><p class=\"phxfap\"></p><p>\"There are other associations but these are the big three and the ones you would most likely visit.\" Liam explained as Shiro nodded. </p><p>Looking at the Adventurer\'s Guild in front of her, Shiro couldn\'t help but marvel at the enormous building. Standing at more than 50 floors from what she could tell, the building had a sleek and smooth design. </p><p>\'Wow~\' She thought unconsciously. </p><p>\"Come on.\" Liam said with a smile as they walked towards the reception. </p><p>Liam and the receptionist talked as he explained the situation to her. Shiro sat by the side as she watched the adventurer\'s walk around. </p><p>\'Odd, how come the adventurers here are all E to D ranks. There\'s hardly any C rank or above. Actually, none for that matter.\' Shiro thought. </p><p>However, what she was most surprised about was how the Demi-Humans are interacting with everyone. Elf\'s, Beast-kin and other subspecies weren\'t uncommon. But they weren\'t treated as slaves either. </p><p>This was different from what she remembered as there was heavy discrimination against the Demi-Humans. </p><p>\"Miss Shiro.\" The receptionist called out as Shiro turned towards her. </p><p class=\"phxfap\"></p><p>\"Would you like to follow me to the examination room?\" She asked as Shiro nodded. </p><p>Liam followed along as they walked towards the elevator. Pressing the button for the 25th floor, the lady turned towards Shiro. </p><p>\"This examination will be recognising your mana signal and track your identity. Hopefully, this should allow us to find your parents.\" She said with a smile. </p><p>Shiro nodded but she could already guess the results. </p><p>When they arrived on the 25th floor, they entered a private room with an orb and a computer next to each other. </p><p>\"Just place your hand onto that orb and it\'ll read your mana.\" The lady said as she sat in front of the computer. </p><p>Shiro nodded as she placed her hand on the orb. Liam stood beside them without saying anything. </p><p>[Data not found] </p><p>As expected, there were no records pertaining to her identity. She was a mystery. </p><p class=\"phxfap\"></p><p>\"This shouldn\'t be… Give me a second.\" The lady said as she started to tap away at the keyboard. </p><p>\"Strange… It\'s as if you don\'t exist. No records, no matching mana, no nothing.\" The lady frowned as she turned to Shiro. Even if you didn\'t register with the Adventurer\'s Guild, there should still be some records. </p><p>\"Where were you before you came here?\" She asked. </p><p>Shiro shook her head showing them she didn\'t know. </p><p>\"Haa…. Alright, head to the lobby and wait for me there. I\'ll have to ask my superiors about this.\" She said as Liam nodded. </p><p>Returning back to floor 1, Liam went to buy a few sandwiches for Shiro to eat. </p><p>Sitting down, he saw her look towards the city. </p><p>\"Are you perhaps curious about the city?\" He asked as she nodded. </p><p>\"The city is called New York. It used to be one of the most populated cities in the world.\" Liam started to talk as Shiro turned to him and listened earnestly. </p><p class=\"phxfap\"></p><p>\"New York was even more popular than the capital. However, after what we now claim as the \'Great Metamorphosis\' the city now became a location for the weak. The very world itself changed as the land expanded.

Not to mention, exploration of the great unknown. The adventurous hearts of many were awakened with the \'Great Metamorphosis\'. </p><p>\"Factions also create subsidiary branches in this city to find anyone with potential and send it to the main branches.\" Liam said as Shiro raised a hand to stop him. </p><p>\"Hm? Are you interested in Factions?\" He asked as she nodded. </p><p>\"Factions are what people create outside of the Adventurer\'s Guild. There are millions of Factions already made and more still coming. However, there are five main Factions who haven\'t been toppled since the start of the Great Metamorphosis. </p><p>\"The Great American Dream Faction led by the Tanker Hero James Thomas. </p><p>\"Tian Long Faction or Heavenly Dragon Faction.

Surname Minamoto, given name Keiko. She is Minamoto Keiko, the assassin \'hero\' who kills without mercy.\" Liam said as Shiro nodded. Her aura became cold however at the mention of Hero. </p><p>She hates Heroes, she was betrayed and killed by one after all. From what she knew, they were egotistical hypocrites. </p><p>However, she too knew why they were called Heroes. It wasn\'t their morals or what they do, it\'s their Class Title and power. </p><p>She didn\'t know the specifics, but she knew that getting a Hero title grants you a lot of benefits. The Hero who killed her had the title [Light Bearer Hero], the title granted him control over the element [Light] as it could increase his speed and increase the temperature of his attacks. There were more benefits but those were the ones she could recognise. </p><p>\'[Light Bearer Hero]… If only I can see you one more time.\' Shiro thought as her killing intent surged outwards. </p><p>She suddenly remembered where she was and quickly restrained the intent. Peaking slightly at Liam, she saw that his face was slightly pale. </p><p>She tilted her head as she gestured her confusion. </p><p>\"Hm? Oh it\'s nothing.\" Liam replied. </p><p>\'What was that?!\' Liam thought nervously looking around. The sudden killing intent made him hold his breath and cold sweat run down his back. He couldn\'t locate the source as the killing intent was so dense and it covered quite a large area around them. He would have never imagined the source to be the young girl sitting in front of him. </p><p>However, what no one realised was Shiro\'s name turning black when she had thought about the [Light Bearer Hero].

Lodging and other services will be provided free of charge as apart of the current education scheme.\" The lady said as they followed behind her. </p><p>This time they entered what seems to be like a combat room as there was a stage in the centre. </p><p>\"The examination is simple. We\'ll first check your mana density. Then we\'ll test your combat prowess to see your rank.\" The lady smiled as Shiro nodded. </p><p>\"Since we\'ve already scanned your mana, we just need to do the combat test.\" She said walking up onto the stage. She rolled her sleeves up and gestured to Shiro. </p><p>[Emilia LVL50 – Berserker] </p><p class=\"pdxirg\"></p><p>\'You want me to fight you?!\' Shiro thought as it showed on her face. </p><p>\"Hahaha, I\'m not going to fight you seriously. Rather you attack me and I evaluate your performance.\" Emilia giggled slightly. </p><p>Shiro nodded and walked onto the stage. </p><p>Her concentrated peaked as this was a good chance to see how she fares against a LVL 50 D rank adventurer. </p><p>Emilia\'s smile faded slightly as she was surprised at the concentration and pressure Shiro was emitting. </p><p>\"Whenever you\'re ready.\" Emilia said and Shiro nodded. </p><p>Ice started to spread outwards from her feet as the entire stage became coated with a layer of Ice. </p><p>Emilia smiled before stamping downwards and cracked the Ice. </p><p>In the time she took to stamp down, Shiro was already near her. </p><p class=\"pdxirg\"></p><p>\'Fast.\' Emilia thought. </p><p>Shiro punched towards her as Emilia hit the side of Shiro\'s hand and deflected the punch. </p><p>She followed along with the momentum and punched with her other hand. Ducking quickly, Emilia tripped Shiro\'s legs as her body was suspended slightly. </p><p>Emilia quickly pulled back as Shiro created Ice around her and slid backwards. </p><p>She raised her hands as Ice Spears formed next to her. </p><p>*BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! </p><p>Emilia dodged and punched the sides of the three Ice Spears shattering them easily. </p><p>By the time she retracted her punch, Shiro was back in her reach. </p><p>Shiro punched towards her stomach as Emilia tried to dodge backwards. </p><p class=\"pdxirg\"></p><p>Her movement was suddenly stopped as an Ice block was preventing her from moving. </p><p>*BOOM! </p><p>She managed to catch Shiro\'s punch before it hit her stomach while her other hand was aimed at Shiro\'s face. Similar to how Emilia blocked her punch, Shiro had already created a piece of Ice to link her spare hand and Emilia\'s hand together stopping her to exerting force. </p><p>Sensing danger, Emilia quickly jumped backwards as Ice exploded out from Shiro. </p><p>Not giving her a moment\'s rest, Shiro flicked her wrist as ice wrapped around Emilia\'s legs to stop her from moving. </p><p>Shiro dashed towards Emilia as she twisted her body and threw an ice spear with increased momentum. </p><p>Emilia\'s face became serious as she punched downwards. Her hands glowed for a moment before that glow disappeared. </p><p>The punch shattered the ice as Emilia flipped backwards avoiding the spear. </p><p>\"Alright you pass. Combat experience is definitely above a E rank. Mana is above E rank. However, you haven\'t Classed Up yet so we\'ll leave you with a E+ Rank. Would that be fine?\" Emilia said stopping the examination. </p><p class=\"pdxirg\"></p><p>Shiro nodded. </p><p>\'That last move was definitely the move [Ground Pound].\' Shiro thought as it would have damaged her quite a lot considering Emilia\'s stats. </p><p>\"Please head to the lobby while I set up your identity.\" Emilia smiled. </p><p>Seeing Shiro leave, Emilia sat down and took a deep breath. </p><p>\"Who is she really?\" Emilia muttered. </p><p>Looking at her hands, Emilia clenched her fists. </p><p>\'It was like I was fighting a senior adventurer just without the strength. The pressure she emitted and her instincts didn\'t match her current strength. I almost made use of my skills against her. No normal E rank nor D rank can force me to do this.\' Emilia thought. </p><p>Most people in the city knew about the D rank Ex adventurer Emilia. Though they don\'t know the exact reason of why she quit to become a guild staff. What they did know was that her combat prowess and skills allowed her to face off against low C ranked adventurers. For her to be forced to almost use her skills against a E rank LVL20 was unbelievable. The enemy was an Ice mage at that too. </p><p>### </p><p class=\"pdxirg\"></p><p>As they walked away from the scene, Liam couldn\'t help but glance over at Shiro. </p><p>\"Miss Shiro, where did you learn to fight like that? Aren\'t you supposed to be a mage?\" He asked as she turned to him. </p><p>\'Is he being serious?\' She thought hearing him ask her that question. </p><p>Shiro pointed at her throat then her mouth as Liam facepalmed. </p><p>\"Ah right. Can\'t talk.\" He muttered. </p><p>Sitting back down, Liam brought out the sandwich he bought before. </p><p>\"Hungry?\" He asked as Shiro nodded. </p><p>Taking the sandwich into her hand, Shiro took a bite. </p><p>\'Tasteless.\' Shiro thought with a slight frown but made sure he couldn\'t see it. </p><p class=\"pdxirg\"></p><p>\"How is it?\" Liam asked. </p><p>Shiro smiled as took another bite. This time, she hid a mana stone in between as she ate with a happy smile. </p><p>Liam sighed in relief. He was hoping the sandwich was to her liking. </p><p>Shiro finished the sandwich as she saw Emilia walking towards them with a smile. </p><p>Sitting down, she put a few things on the table. </p><p>\"First is your ID. You can always apply for a new one if you lose your old one.\" She said pointing at the card. </p><p>When making her ID, she did see another similar entry as it was a record about an escaped monster. </p><p>However, the system clearly showed Shiro being a human Ice Mage. Not to mention, the monster was called Shino, not Shiro. </p><p>[Name: Shiro </p><p class=\"pdxirg\"></p><p>Estimated Age: 13 </p><p>Rank: E+ </p><p>Class: Ice Mage </p><p>LVL: 20] </p><p>\"This book is a guide on all the facilities in the city. You can also find a map of the whole city in this guide.\" Emilia said opening up the book. </p><p>Shiro could see the guide written in an unfamiliar language as she tilted her head. </p><p>\"If you can\'t read don\'t worry. I let them know about this so you can press on a location you\'re curious about and it\'ll explain it to you.\" Emilia smiled and pressed on the Blacksmith Association. </p><p>-The Blacksmith\'s Association is the gathering point of people aspiring to craft weapons and armour. You may commission a custom-made armour/weapon or check out an artisan\'s wares. – </p><p>\"See.\" Emilia smiled as Shiro nodded hearing the audio cue. </p><p class=\"pdxirg\"></p><p>\"In this file are the doc.u.ments needed for the school transfer. Everything you need to know is in there and once again, audio cued. Instructions are inside and it will tell you what to do.\" Emilia said handing her a file with paperwork inside. </p><p>\"When you find the reception, just give this file to the receptionist and she\'ll sort things out.\" Emilia singled out a file as Shiro nodded. </p><p>Shiro then pointed at the two stones as she looked at them in surprise. </p><p>[Artificial Skill Stone – Mini Map] </p><p>Mini map – Displays a map of your surroundings as well as the general location of monsters nearby. </p><p>[Artificial Skill Stone – Inspection] </p><p>Inspection – Shows the name, level, class, HP and MP of a monster. </p><p>\'Artificial Skill Stone?! They can make those?!\' Shiro thought in shock. She heard about the Skill Stones being dropped but never being made. </p><p>\"These two stones are what is given to every adventurer. These help tremendously out in the field and the creator made it a requirement for everyone to have one of each.\" Emilia chuckled slightly seeing Shiro\'s surprise. It reminded her of a little kid when they\'re given a new toy. </p><p class=\"pdxirg\"></p><p>Shiro grabbed the two stones and looked at Emilia just to make sure she wasn\'t high or something. </p><p>\"Go on.\" Emilia gestured as Shiro learned the skills. </p><p>[Passive Skill Gained – Mini map] </p><p>[Skill Gained – Inspection] </p><p>As the passive skill suggested, a Mini Map could be seen on the top right corner of her vision. It allowed her to see the surroundings as well as white dots to represent humans. </p><p>Her icon was the shape of an arrow as it was also white. This was due to her [Disguise] Skill changing her displayed race to human with the addition of changing her class from Snow Girl to Ice Mage. </p><p>Going through a few more formalities with the help of Liam, Shiro had her identity completed and was ready for school. </p><p>They settled with her being around 13 due to her features being still quite immature. </p><p>\'Let\'s see… Found it.\' Shiro smiled as she pressed on the images with a hammer and coins. </p><p class=\"pdxirg\"></p><p>-Auction Building – Find the items you want and either bid or buy them. – </p><p>For her Class Up, she needed a D rank mana stone. The stone shouldn\'t be too hard to procure as both Blacksmiths and Pharmacist need it in their respective crafts. </p><p>Considering the fact that this city is a place where E to D ranks hang out, there should be quite a few pieces of D rank mana stone. </p><p>Making her way to the building, she entered it and was greeted by a well-decorated room. The main hub had electronic displays showing you what items were on sale as well as the auction rooms the items were being sold in. </p><p>\'This is just like the Terminal back in Aria. It shouldn\'t be too hard to use.\' Shiro thought as she tapped the screen. </p><p>The layout was simple as it showed items that were popular, recommended and suitable for newcomers. </p><p>Above this, there was a bar that shows \'Write what you need\' and a search button next to it. </p><p>\'…. This missy can\'t talk, read or write. What the hell does any of this mean?!\' Shiro thought as her face was frustrated. She thought they would have pictures to show which item was on sale and the price. Yet she didn\'t think that there were so many miscellaneous items that it covered the entire page. The categories were written instead of pictures so she couldn\'t look for mana stones that way either. </p><p>\'Maybe someone can help me.\' Shiro thought as she looked around and walked to the closest person near her. </p><p class=\"pdxirg\"></p><p>She couldn\'t speak so she tapped his arm to get his attention. </p><p>\"Che, don\'t bother me.\" The man said glaring at her. </p><p>\'…\' </p><p>She decided to look for people that seemed to be working here instead. </p><p>\"Hello, how may I help?\" A man asked as she walked over to the reception. </p><p>Shiro took out a mana stone as she pointed at it. </p><p>\"You wish to put a mana stone on sale?\" He asked but she shook her head. </p><p>\"You want to buy mana stones?\" </p><p>Shiro gave him a nod. </p><p class=\"pdxirg\"></p><p>\"You can find mana stones on those terminals.\" The man said pointing over at the terminals. </p><p>She shook her head. </p><p>Going through the constant back and forth of not knowing what Shiro want to convey, the man became annoyed. </p><p>\"You need help but won\'t tell me what you need help with. Is this a joke?\" He said with a frown. </p><p>\'Joke my ass! If this missy could speak, I wouldn\'t even be asking you would I?!\' Shiro thought in her head with frustration. </p><p>Gesturing towards her throat and mouth, she made an X sign showing him she couldn\'t speak. </p><p>\"You can\'t speak?\" He asked as she nodded with a roll of her eyes. </p><p>\"Alright, so you want to buy a mana stone right?\" The man asked feeling a little guilty. </p><p>Shiro nodded as he tapped away at his computer. </p><p class=\"pdxirg\"></p><p>\"What rank do you need?\" He asked. </p><p>\'Why are you still asking that question? Did you forget that this missy here can\'t speak?\' Shiro thought as she looked at him with a blank expression. </p><p>\"Oh right erm. Put 1 finger up for E rank and 2 fingers up for D rank. For C rank and higher, you would need to look for it in a bigger city.\" The man said as Shiro held two fingers up. </p><p>\"D rank, ok. The lowest price for a D rank Mana Stone is 25,000 USD and is currently under bid in room 6.\" The man said as Shiro nodded. </p><p>\"You\'ll have to use a terminal if you want to bid.\" The man continued. </p><p>\"Since you don\'t know how to use one, I can do it for you. Place you hand onto this crystal and it\'ll subtract the required USD from your account.\" The man said showing her the bidding page and the crystal. </p><p>Shiro nodded as she touched the crystal. </p><p>[Transfer 26,000 USD?] </p><p>She saw this on her interface as confirmed. The number on the bidding page jumped up to 26,000USD as the man was slightly surprised. </p><p class=\"pdxirg\"></p><p>Even though the young girl in front of him was a LVL 20 adventurer, he didn\'t think she\'ll hold that much money. </p><p>The bid finally ended with the final cost being 30,000USD. </p><p>Shiro waited patiently as the man went to retrieve the item. </p><p>\"Please double check that you have the right item before you leave.\" He said handing her the mana stone. </p><p>[D rank mana stone] </p><p>-A D ranked mana stone taken from the corpse of a Hobgoblin. </p><p>Shiro nodded as she jogged out of the auction house. </p><p>\'She can afford a 30,000USD mana stone but no shoes or socks?\' The man thought watching her leave. </p><p>Shiro sat down near a fountain as she looked at her interface. </p><p>[Class Up requirements met.

Would you like to Class Up into Snow Girl ★?] </p><p>Shiro was about to confirm when she realised something. Class Ups for a monster maybe different compared to the Class Up a human would experience. </p><p>In her past life, she remembers seeing a monster evolve before their eyes and it was a spectacle. You couldn\'t not see it. A beam of energy emerged from the monster as a cocoon formed around it. </p><p>If that was to happen in the middle of a plaza… </p><p>Shiro shivered slightly thinking about the consequences. </p><p>\'The best way would be for me to enter a Dungeon. I\'ve got some time before I need to head towards the school dorms where I would be studying for now so I should be fine.\' She thought as she brought up her map. </p><p>She remembers the Dungeon signs being that of a tower. There were several E rank Dungeons nearby and the closest one was just a 5-minute jog away from where she was. </p><p>Storing everything away in her inventory, Shiro jogged over to the Dungeon. </p><p>Due to her high AGI, it didn\'t take too long for her to arrive. </p><p>This Dungeon was a public one as anyone can enter when they want to. There are restrictions to how many people can go in there at a time though. If a Dungeon is higher than level 10, one would need at least a party of 5 E ranks to enter. </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>From what she could hear from the surroundings, this Dungeon was a particularly weak Dungeon so anyone can go in. Even solo. </p><p>It was good that she could enter alone. However, even if she couldn\'t, she would have just find another chance to Class Up. </p><p>Her task was simple. Go in, Class Up, come out. Nothing more nothing less. </p><p>Entering the Dungeon, she saw that she was in the middle of a plain. Slimes were jumping around as one tried to attack her. </p><p>[HP: 3795/3800] </p><p>\'…\' Shiro looked at the blue slime which dealt 5 damage to her. </p><p>Crouching down, Shiro gave the slime a smile as she reached out her hand. </p><p>Tapping the would-be forehead of the slime, she froze the slime instantly and shattered it. </p><p>Jogging a safe distance away, she made sure that no one is around her before confirming the Class Up. </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>Blue light appeared near her as it formed a silk-like layer which wrapped around her body. </p><p>Shiro could feel her powers increasing as she gained knowledge about her new skills. </p><p>[Class Up complete] </p><p>[Name: Shiro </p><p>Race: Snow Girl (Evolution Criteria yet to be met) </p><p>Level: 21 </p><p>Class: Snow Girl★, Nanomancer </p><p>HP: 3800/3800 </p><p>MP: 4800/4800 </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>STR: 35 (+25) </p><p>VIT: 30 (+40) </p><p>INT: 60 (+50) </p><p>AGI: 60 (+5) </p><p>DEX: 21 </p><p>DEF: 10 (+32) </p><p>Unassigned Points: 20 </p><p>Balance: 5,000 USD </p><p>Equipment (Tap to Display) </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>Skills – </p><p>Snow Girl ★: </p><p>Tier 2 Ice magic, Passive Regeneration, Blessed by Ice, Snow Magic, Faded Snow Movement, Cold Aura. </p><p>Nanomancer: </p><p>Dagger Creation. </p><p>Other: </p><p>Mini-map, Inspection, Disguise, Power Boost(Equipment), Fire Spirit Blessing(Equipment).] </p><p>The silk cocoon unwrapped itself as Shiro sighed in relief. </p><p>\'Thankfully I didn\'t Class Up back in the plaza.\' She thought before checking out her new skills. </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>[Snow Magic: </p><p>Magic which has high synergy with Ice magic.

She put 10 points into her INT, 5 points into AGI and the last 5 into DEX. </p><p>This bumped her total MP to 5300. </p><p>Walking back to the Dungeon gate, she left with a light smile. </p><p>The people were surprised seeing her exit so fast as they saw her enter a few minutes ago. But they shivered slightly when she walked past due to the low temperature. </p><p>As she was walking, Shiro couldn\'t help but notice some changes to her skin. After her Class Up, her skin became much smoother and soft looking that she couldn\'t help but give it a pinch and poke. </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>Her skin was cool to the touch as it was rather refreshing. </p><p>\'How nice.\' She thought. </p><p>To outsiders, a beautiful young girl was walking whilst prodding her own arm. </p><p>As she made her way to the school, she saw the building situated in the middle of several open fields. There were branches connected to the main building as she could see a separate building which seemed to be the lodging. </p><p>Walking over, Shiro looked at the students in curiosity. Most of them were well dressed and seemed to be curious about her as well. </p><p>Well…. Mostly the fact that she\'s barefooted even though Shiro herself doesn\'t really mind. </p><p>Arriving at the lodging, she checked her guide once more to make sure the location is correct. </p><p>Matching up the map in the guide with her own minimap, Shiro sighed in relief. </p><p>Knocking on the door, she heard a beep as an audio cue kicked in. </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>-Due to the lack of Student ID, please state in simple words the reason for your arrival. – </p><p>\'*******!!!!! Like hell I can speak!\' Shiro cursed in her mind as this was annoying her. She wished she could learn how to write this language quickly so she can actually communicate. Though it still wouldn\'t help in this situation as she needed to speak. </p><p>While she could try to speak out, it would just seem like she\'s opening her mouth without actually saying anything. Maybe it was due to her monster physiology, but no recognisable language came out of her mouth. In fact, no noise came out except for a few cries like Ah or Oh. </p><p>As Shiro\'s frustration grew, the temperature around her dropped as frost could be seen forming over the device. </p><p>\"Erm, hello? Excuse me?\" A shivering voice rang out behind Shiro as she calmed down quickly. </p><p>Turning around, she saw what seemed to be an Elf. </p><p>She had long blond hair, pointed ears, emerald eyes, a delicate face and modest body proportions. Her height was roughly half a head taller than Shiro. </p><p>She sighed in relief as she felt the temperature rise again. </p><p>[Lyrica LVL 10 – Elven Swordswoman] </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>While Shiro was inspecting Lyrica, she was also inspecting the Shiro. </p><p>[Shiro LVL 21 – Ice Mage] </p><p>\"Wow! Level 21!\" Lyrica said astonished at Shiro\'s level. </p><p>\"Erm, so I saw you struggle with the voice recognition. Do you need help?\" She asked with some nervousness in her voice seeing Shiro stare at her so intently. </p><p>Shiro nodded and held up a piece of paper. She remembered Emilia telling her to show this to the lady at the reception so it might help her out here. </p><p>\"Hm? Let\'s see… Er name, Shiro. Age...13?! Disabilities… Mute? Ah so that\'s why.\" Lyrica couldn\'t help but smile wearily as it was truly unfortunate. </p><p>For those without a Student ID, they had to state the reason of why they were visiting. Yet the girl in front of her was mute so how could she state the reason as to why she was here? </p><p>\"Here, I\'ll take you inside.\" Lyrica smiled as she scanned her ID and opened the door. </p><p>\'What a nice girl.\' Shiro thought with a smile. </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>Following her in, they walked towards the registration till. </p><p>\"Excuse me.\" Lyrica called out as a middle-aged lady walked up. </p><p>\"Lyrica? Who\'s this?\" She asked peeking over at Shiro. </p><p>\"Err.. She\'s Shiro. And she seems to be a new student. She\'s mute so she couldn\'t get in.\" Lyrica said as she gestured towards Shiro. </p><p>Seeing that the woman in front of her should be the receptionist, Shiro brought out the files. </p><p>The woman saw the files and understood what Shiro needed. Taking the files, she started to work away at her computer. </p><p>Shiro wanted to say thank you to Lyrica but could only sigh since she wouldn\'t be able to understand her. </p><p>\"Done. Here is your student ID. Your room is on the 3rd floor room 306, next to Lyrica\'s. You can help each other out.\" The lady said as Lyrica nodded. </p><p>\"I\'ll show you the way.\" Lyrica said eagerly as she went to grab Shiro\'s hand. </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>However, she flinched slightly feeling how cold her hands were. </p><p>Shiro frowned at her hands and could only give Lyrica an apologising smile. </p><p>\"No worries. Is it something you can\'t control? I saw it get colder when you got annoyed outside.\" Lyrica said as Shiro nodded. </p><p>Shiro was surprised at how observant she was. </p><p>Lyrica walked in front of Shiro as she showed her the way to her room. </p><p>\"So your uniform should arrive tomorrow. Your timetable should be on the tablet. As for the lessons, we can choose whichever lesson you want to go to. You just need to be able to pass the end of year exams.\" Lyrica said as they arrived. </p><p>Shiro pulled out her file as she showed it to Lyrica. </p><p>Pointing at the words, Shiro shook her head. </p><p>\"The information is wrong?\" She asked. </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>Shiro pointed again as she shook her head. </p><p>\"Is there something missing?\" Lyrica asked taking a second read of the information. </p><p>Shiro frowned but gained an idea. </p><p>She pointed at her throat and made an X sign. </p><p>\"I know you\'re mute.\" Lyrica nodded. </p><p>Shiro then made a writing motion and made an X. </p><p>\"You can\'t write either?\" </p><p>Shiro nodded. She then pointed to her eyes before pointing at the words and made another X sign. </p><p>\"You can\'t read either?!\" Lyrica said surprised. </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>\'How did she survive till now?\' Lyrica thought as she had an idea of what Shiro was asking. </p><p>\"You want me to help you with reading and writing?\" She asked not sure. </p><p>Shiro nodded quickly with a smile. </p><p>\"Oh that\'s simple then. I can teach you about it every day when you have time.\" Lyrica smiled as Shiro nodded. </p><p>Entering her room, Shiro sat down on a chair and leaned backwards. Her mind started to wonder as she thought about the girl she just met. </p><p>\'That girl, Lyrica… She shows symptoms of a low self-esteem. Not only was she concerned over the impression she made on me, she was also slightly reluctant to put herself first. Her body posture showed that she tried to make herself seem smaller than mine. </p><p>Rather than saying when she had time to teach me, she was worried about whether or not \'I\' had time to be taught. </p><p>The most likely causes of this are poor performance or family issues.\' Shiro thought looking at the wall connected to Lyrica\'s room. </p><p>\'I should see if I can solve this for her as payment for teaching me how to read and write.\' Shiro thought. She wasn\'t the type to repay hatred with 100 times the hatred. Nor was she one to repay kindness with 100 times the kindness. </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>However, she did like to treat people who gave her a good impression. A whim if one had to classify this. </p><p>For a girl like Lyrica who treated her well on the first meeting, Shiro would try to help her resolve a problem in return for that kindness. </p><p>### </p><p>Lyrica who returned to her room sat by her bed. </p><p>\'Was my impression on her ok? Was she freaked out by me? What if she doesn\'t want to be friends with me? I should be fine right? I mean she wanted my help. </p><p>She needs MY help. Someone actually needed MY help. But what if I disappoint her with bad teaching?\' Lyrica thought with a nervous frown. </p><p>\"I was too hasty… What if I can\'t teach her well enough.\" She muttered with a sigh. </p><p>Looking at her tablet, Lyrica searched up the best ways of teaching reading and writing. </p><p>### </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>Waking up to a frozen stiff bed cover, Shiro\'s smile twitched as she knew this was most likely going to be an ongoing problem. </p><p>She looked over at the clock and saw that it was 7:30 AM. </p><p>\'Hmm, a little early I guess.\' Shiro thought as she rubbed her stomach. </p><p>Taking out a few mana stones, she threw it in her mouth as she had a look at how man E ranked mana stones she had left. </p><p>[E Rank Mana Stone x132] </p><p>\'132? Should last me for a while. Though with that being said, I should probably hunt a few more monsters to get my stock filled.\' Shiro thought as she noticed her increased intake. </p><p>Previously, 3 to 5 mana stones could help her through the day. Now, 5 mana stones were a small snack for her. </p><p>Considering the pattern, Shiro was sure she would eventually need to eat a warehouse full of E rank stones just to fill her stomach. </p><p>*Knock Knock Knock </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>Shiro heard the door knock as she walked over and opened the door. </p><p>\'Lyrica?\' Shiro thought seeing her still in her pyjamas. She had dark circles under her eyes as she pulled out a thick notebook. </p><p>\"I\'ve done it…. I\'ve found the best way to teach reading and writing to you.\" Lyrica said as she smiled. </p><p>Her eyelids were drooping every so often as Shiro frowned slightly. </p><p>\'Did this girl stay up all night to compile this?\' She thought. </p><p>Shiro held the helms of her pyjama as she dragged Lyrica back to her room. </p><p>Shiro pointed at the bed as her eyes bore into Lyrica\'s. </p><p>\"Huh? Shiro you want me to sleep?\" Lyrica asked as Shiro nodded and took the notebook. She pushed Lyrica onto the bed gently as she looked at her. </p><p>Shiro made a sleeping motion as she pointed at the pillow. Her eyes seemed to only take yes for an answer. </p><p class=\"ytzolp\"></p><p>Lyrica decided to relent to the comfort of the bed. </p><p>The moment she closed her eyelids, she fell asleep almost instantly. </p><p>\'Heh, what a foolish girl.\' Shiro though as she covered her up. </p><p>She sat down as she looked at the notebook in her hands. </p><p>[Efficient Notebook for learning reading and writing. </p><p>Creator – Lyrica Valenstaine] </p><p>Shiro could only sigh seeing the effort Lyrica put into making this even though they\'ve barely met. </p><p>\'As the first person I\'ve met at this school, I\'ll give you some privileges.\' Shiro thought before turning to the notebook. She wanted to see if she could decode this notebook and study on her own. </p>'),(218,10,'Chapter 9 Hidden Proficiency',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>\"Mn…..\" Lyrica slowly opened her eyes as she felt refreshed after sleeping. </p><p>\'Oh right! Shiro!\' She thought as she instantly sat up. </p><p>She looked around and was surprised seeing Shiro at the desk with lots of paper around her. </p><p>Currently, Shiro had tilted her head back as it seemed like she was fatigued. </p><p>Noticing that Lyrica had woken up, Shiro grabbed a notepad and quickly wrote something down. </p><p>[You\'re awake.] </p><p>She looked over with a smile. </p><p>Lyrica was both shocked and surprised. </p><p>\"You learned reading and writing in the time I was asleep?! How?!\" Lyrica asked. </p><p>[Decoding. I matched my audio cues saying the words with the alphabet. I slowly decoded what each letter sounded like and memorised it.] Shiro wrote down as Lyrica couldn\'t believe someone could learn a whole language in the time she was asleep. </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>\"Unbelievable…\" Lyrica muttered. </p><p>[Is it really? We live in a world with Dungeons and monsters. I think learning language in a day isn\'t that shocking.] Shiro wrote down with a grin. </p><p>\"I suppose so.\" Lyrica said as it made sense. </p><p>[So what lesson\'s do you have?] </p><p>\"Lessons? I take swordsmanship, Close Quarter Combat and Dungeon Exploration.\" Lyrica replied as Shiro nodded. </p><p>[Then I\'ll take those lessons with you.] She smiled. </p><p>\"Eh?! What about yours? Aren\'t you an Ice Mage?\" Lyrica asked slightly fl.u.s.tered. </p><p>Shiro smiled as she flicked her fingers and a sword made from Ice appeared. </p><p>[Close Quarters Combat is important for a mage as well.] Shiro wrote down. </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>[That and also you\'ve helped me greatly.] </p><p>\"No, it\'s mostly because of your efforts. I didn\'t do anything.\" Lyrica shook her head as she didn\'t believe in her own contribution. </p><p>[Without your help, this would have taken much longer. Being able to recognise the language today will help me greatly.] Shiro wrote down as Lyrica became embarrassed. </p><p>[Since you\'ve slept for the entire day, you want to go eat?] </p><p>\"Eh? Ah! It\'s 8PM!\" Lyrica said shocked as she held the clock. </p><p>[It\'ll be my treat.] Shiro wrote down. </p><p>\"You really don\'t have to. I can afford it.\" Lyrica said looking at Shiro. </p><p>[If you don\'t let me do this, I will be angry.] Shiro frowned slightly. </p><p>\"Fine…\" Lyrica said as she quickly dressed up. </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>They walked towards the food court as Lyrica couldn\'t help but ask a few questions. </p><p>\"Shiro, how come you don\'t have shoes or socks?\" She asked. </p><p>[I woke up this way. It\'s doesn\'t matter though since it doesn\'t hurt.] Shiro replied. </p><p>\"How did you manage to get to level 21 even though you\'re 13?\" </p><p>[I kill monsters and level up obviously. That being said, how old are you?] </p><p>\"Me? I\'m 15 and only a level 10…\" Lyrica said slightly depressed. </p><p>[No worries. Since we can explore Dungeons, I can help you level up quickly.] </p><p>\"Why are you so nice?\" Lyrica asked. </p><p>[You showed me kindness so I\'ll naturally reply with kindness.] Shiro smiled as they arrived. </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>They ordered some food and started to eat away. </p><p>Shiro only ordered a sandwich as she hid a few mana stones inside or else the sandwich would taste just like water. It doesn\'t fill her up either, only mana stone does. </p><p>Lyrica seemed nervous as she kept fidgeting whilst they ate. </p><p>[What\'s wrong?] </p><p>\"Mn? Oh its just that this makes us seem like friends.\" </p><p>[Are we not though?] </p><p>\"Eh? Um I guess but you don\'t want to hang out with me.\" </p><p>[How come?] </p><p>\"Well… you might get looked down upon because you\'re hanging out with me. Everyone is at least level 13 plus when they reach the age of 15. Yet I\'m still at level 10.\" Lyrica said. </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>\"A genius like you who\'s reached level 21 at the age of 13 shouldn\'t be hanging out with trash like me.\" Lyrica sighed. </p><p>[Then what do you think about those people at a higher level? Some have a difference of 50 levels yet they\'re at the same age. Are they still trash?] Shiro wrote down. </p><p>\"Of course not. They had the talent to reach such a high level after all.\" Lyrica replied. </p><p>[Then have you heard of those people who jump levels to challenge their superiors?] </p><p>Lyrica nodded as she proceeded to say; </p><p>\"Experience can make up for the lack in stats.\" </p><p>[Then we just need to give you more experience. Not to mention, your class seems to be different from the normal starting class. Maybe it\'s because of your elven heritage, but it may need more EXP for you to level up once.] Shiro wrote down. </p><p>\"It can\'t be.\" Lyrica denied. </p><p>\"The class Elven Swordswoman is the basic class of every Elf who chooses to use the sword.\" Lyrica said as Shiro felt her smile twitch. </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>\'This girl…\' Shiro thought as she was denying herself a little too hard. </p><p>She remembers the Elven classes. At the start, they were basic classes. But later on, they become harder to class up compared to normal classes. </p><p>This is because everyone had a chance at obtaining the Special Class [Elven Sword Saintess]. </p><p>Each type of weapon had its own [Saint] class. Examples being, [Elven Archer Saint], [Elven Axe Saint] and [Elven Dagger Saint]. </p><p>However, there was only one shot at this Class Up and if they failed, they had to go with [Elven Grand Swordswomen]/[Elven Grand Archer] Etc… </p><p>The only reason Shiro knew about this class was due to the Elf in the [Light Bearer Hero]\'s party. </p><p>She had the class and exhibited superior battle prowess than even the hero at certain moments in her life. Shame she died during a large battle that raged on for 5 days and 5 nights. </p><p>[Then why don\'t we work together? You can help me while I help you in the dungeon.] Shiro smiled. </p><p>\"Eh? How would I help you?\" </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>[I can\'t speak so there are some limitations in my life. Not only that, I don\'t know anything about myself. So having a friend stay with me helps a lot.] Shiro wrote down making up a reason. </p><p>Lyrica\'s eyes brightened up as she grabbed Shiro\'s hand whilst ignoring the cold. </p><p>\'!!!\' Shiro was shocked seeing her suddenly grabbing her hand. </p><p>\"You can count on me!\" Lyrica said as Shiro could only chuckle slightly. </p><p>After they finished their meal, they walked home with Lyrica feeling happier than ever. </p><p>Shiro shook her head with a smile. </p><p>But it was during this that an idea suddenly popped into her mind and a grin formed on her face. </p><p>Tapping Lyrica\'s shoulders, Shiro showed Lyrica her note pad. </p><p>[So you know how Elf\'s have longer life expectancy than humans? Wouldn\'t that mean you\'re currently a lot younger in human years? So you aren\'t under level, but rather you\'re looking at this using the wrong age system.] Shiro wrote down as Lyrica paused. </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>\"That does seem to be the case…\" She replied feeling embarrassed. </p><p>However, age doesn\'t really matter. The higher level you are, the more mana you have stored inside you. The more mana you have, the more it vitalises your body. </p><p>This made it so that you\'re able to live for much longer than normal. But Shiro won\'t tell Lyrica that since she had just managed to give her some hope. </p><p>[Therefore, you have no reason to feel down.] Shiro wrote as Lyrica nodded. </p><p>\"You\'re right!\" Lyrica smiled. </p><p>Returning back to their rooms, Shiro found a package next to her door. </p><p>\'It\'s probably the uniform.\' She thought as she took the package inside with her. </p><p>Inside the package was an assortment of clothes. A set for winter and a set for summer. </p><p>The summer uniform was a short-sleeved grey dress with a red bow tie. The skirt stopped around her knees as the uniform also came with black knee socks and shoes. </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>The winter uniform, on the other hand, was earmuffs, scarf and a long-sleeved white shirt with a black vest. It included a uniform jacket as it was also grey in colour. A separate skirt that reached her knees and black tights. </p><p>Folding up the winter uniform, Shiro placed the summer uniform ready for tomorrow. </p><p>Before sleeping, she checked her timetable for the lessons she\'s applied for. </p><p>[Lessons] </p><p>-Swordsmanship </p><p>-Magic </p><p>-Close Quarters Combat </p><p>-Dungeon Exploration </p><p>She chose to apply for Magic as there may be some interesting concepts in this new world. </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>\'The first lesson tomorrow is Swordsmanship. I have decent Swordsmanship but it can definitely improve.\' Shiro thought before falling asleep. </p><p>### </p><p>\"So Shiro here will be studying with everyone. She\'s 13 so be patient with her. Oh also she\'s mute so she\'ll be carrying her notepad around with her.\" The teacher called out in the swordsmanship class. </p><p>A girl raised her hands as the teacher gestured for her to speak. </p><p>\"Why is she in the Swordsmanship class? Isn\'t she a level 21 Ice Mage?\" The girl asked. </p><p>[That\'s because learning some swordsmanship will be helpful for mages as close quarters are our weak points.] Shiro wrote down. </p><p>\"As Shiro mentioned, this is beneficial to her. Many high-level mages know some form of close quarter combat to keep themselves safe.\" The teacher nodded. </p><p>\"Sit wherever you like.\" She said as Shiro nodded. </p><p>Walking over to Lyrica, Shiro sat next to her as she could hear a few mutters around her. </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>[Hey.] Shiro smiled as Lyrica nodded. </p><p>\"Try not to talk to me too much. They\'ll look down on you.\" Lyrica whispered. </p><p>[I don\'t care.] Shiro wrote as they focused on the class. </p><p>The class itself was pretty simple for Shiro. It focused on the stances and which part of the body you need to focus on when using the sword. </p><p>While Shiro found this pretty boring, she could see Lyrica writing down notes earnestly. </p><p>The theory lesson was over soon and it was time for demonstration. Everyone paired up as Shiro could see a bunch of people wanting to pair up with Lyrica. </p><p>However, she rejected all of them. </p><p>[How come you don\'t want to go with them?] Shiro asked. </p><p>\"They just want to suppress me. Because I\'m level 10, my stats are lower than theirs. I can\'t really gain any form of experience sparring against them.\" Lyrica replied with a sigh. </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>[Them I\'ll spar with you.] Shiro smiled. </p><p>\"Eh? But aren\'t your stats much bigger than mine?\" </p><p>[I won\'t attack actively. You try to break my guard ok? Land a hit on me and you win.] Shiro wrote down as she picked up a wooden longsword. </p><p>Lyrica nodded as she too picked up a wooden longsword. </p><p>[Ready when you are.] Shiro wrote down as she held the sword with one hand. </p><p>Lyrica nodded as she ran towards Shiro with her sword. </p><p>Shiro only smiled as she placed the flat side of the blade on her palm and parried Lyrica\'s sword. </p><p>Shiro allowed her sword to slide down the blade as she was about to attack. </p><p>Lyrica drew the blade upwards to try block but Shiro landed a light attack on her shoulder. </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she had a suspicion about Lyrica\'s moves. </p><p>Not giving up, Lyrica held the sword in a reverse grip as she clashed with Shiro once more. </p><p>This time, at the very moment the swords clashed, Lyrica let go of her sword as she held it in an upright position. She twisted the sword as it moved Shiro\'s sword downwards. </p><p>Shiro smiled as she crouched down and tripped Lyrica up. </p><p>\"Again!\" Lyrica said as she had a smile on her face. </p><p>They continued for several bouts as Lyrica kept getting knocked down. To outsiders, she was taking a beating. To Shiro, Lyrica was improving quickly. </p><p>\'This girl is smart. She quickly corrects herself when she finds out what went wrong. If it wasn\'t for the other students suppressing her with their attributes, Lyrica would most definitely not have this self-esteem issue.\' Shiro thought as she hopped back and slid on the ground slightly. </p><p>\'However, her movements seem a little awkward at times. It\'s like she\'s trying to use a staff rather than sword.\' </p><p>She raised her hand to get Lyrica to stop. Picking up the notepad, Shiro started to write something down. </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>[You\'ve improved a lot Lyrica. So smart.] Shiro praised. </p><p>\"It\'s just dumb luck.\" Lyrica said as Shiro shook her head. </p><p>[I have an idea. Do you want to give it a try?] </p><p>\"An idea? What idea?\" </p><p>Shiro walked over to the teacher and got her attention. </p><p>[Do you have a handle without a wooden blade?] She asked. </p><p>\"A handle? Yeah we do. What do you need it for?\" </p><p>[I think Lyrica\'s moves match a different weapon better. I want to see if I can use my Ice to find out the weapon.] </p><p>\"I see. Since you have an idea give it a try.\" The teacher smiled as passed Shiro a wooden handle. </p><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>[Thank you.] Shiro wrote down as she jogged back to Lyrica. </p><p>The temperature around her dropped as Ice started to coagulate on both ends of the handle. </p><p>As the Ice finished, Lyrica was surprised at what Shiro held in her hands. </p><p>It was a dual-ended blade. On either side of the handle was a double sided sword as Shiro lightly threw it over to Lyrica. </p><p>[Give it a try.] Shiro wrote down as Lyrica nodded. </p><p>Holding the weapon, Lyrica waved it around as she became more proficient. </p><p>\"Wow! Shiro, this weapon is really easy to use.\" Lyrica said surprised at how easy it was for her to use it. </p><p>\'I knew it.\' Shiro thought with a smile. What Lyrica experienced was hidden proficiency. </p><p>Hidden proficiency was a situation where the body would exhibit movement habits for a certain type of weapon. It wouldn\'t show up on the status board so it was hard for people to know which weapon suited them. Most of the time, it was custom made weapons. </p><div class=\"adsbox\"></div><p class=\"dbhfjf\"></p><p>For those who did discover their hidden proficiency, their combat prowess soared as their body movements were designed to fit that weapon. </p><p>While the dual ended blade wasn\'t exactly Lyrica\'s hidden proficiency, Shiro already knew the weapon was something similar to the dual ended blade. </p><p>She noticed this during the fight as Lyrica would always fall back on using the bottom of her sword when she was forced into a tight situation. </p><p>When used with a longsword, it is suicidal. When used with a dual-ended sword, it was effective. </p><p>[Try attacking me now.] Shiro wrote down as Lyrica nodded. </p><p>Twirling the blade, Lyrica charged towards Shiro. </p><p>Parrying the top down slash, Shiro twisted her body as she dodged the other end of the blade. </p><p>Lyrica didn\'t let her loose as the blade followed Shiro\'s movements like a ghost. </p><p>Parrying her attack several more times with a few close calls, Shiro was surprised at how powerful Lyrica\'s hidden proficiency was. </p><p>Even though she was suppressing herself until she was roughly level 10 in stats, it was still amazing for Lyrica to sneak in a few close calls. </p><p>The spar finished as Lyrica panted heavily. Shiro, on the other hand, was fine as always. </p><p>[Congratulations Lyrica. You\'ve found the weapon you\'re really good at.] Shiro smiled and showed her the writing. </p><p>\"It\'s all thanks to you Shiro.\" Lyrica replied happily feeling her confidence rise. </p><p>Shiro was an enigma for her. The moment she arrived; Lyrica felt her life change. Shiro gave her confidence and even a weapon she was strangely proficient in using. If Shiro never appeared, Lyrica doesn\'t know what kind of a state she would still be in. </p>'),(219,10,'Chapter 10 Bet',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>After the spar, it was time for lunch. Both Lyrica and Shiro went together as Shiro bought some sandwiches once again. </p><p>[Do you want to go Dungeon Exploring later? We\'ll try to get some money so we can make you that new weapon.] Shiro wrote down whilst eating a mana stone filled sandwich. </p><p>\"Eh? What do you mean?\" Lyrica asked. </p><p>[Don\'t you need the dual ended sword? We\'ll save up some money so we can go get one made for you. Then you\'ll be able to do Dungeons much easier.] </p><p>\"Well… A higher level Dungeon needs at least 5 people. I\'ve always been on my own so I don\'t really enter Dungeons most of the time. When I do, the loot goes to the other people since they have more contribution than me.\" Lyrica admitted with slight shame. </p><p>Shiro frowned hearing about this. </p><p>[It\'s fine. I had my Class Up so I should be a D rank adventurer. Right now I\'m a E+ because I didn\'t Class Up last time.] Shiro explained showing Lyrica her Guild ID. </p><p>\"Even then, we need 2 D ranks to enter the level 10+ Dungeon.\" Lyrica said as Shiro frowned. </p><p>\'Troublesome.\' She thought. </p><p>[Is there a way to get a permit to enter the Dungeon with just us 2?] Shiro asked but Lyrica shook her head. </p><p class=\"esojpv\"></p><p>Shiro tried to think of solutions but couldn\'t come up with one. </p><p>To level Lyrica up, the best way was for them to enter a Dungeon higher level than 10. She was able to enter alone into the public Dungeon last time was due to the monsters being level 5 or below. That and also she was a E+ rank adventurer. </p><p>A woman walked pass as she paused seeing what Shiro had just wrote down. </p><p>\"You want to enter a Dungeon with just the two of you?!\" She said as Shiro turned to her. </p><p>[Madison LVL 14 – Swordswoman] </p><p>She had brown hair tied in a ponytail, black eyes and a average face that had its own sense of beauty. </p><p>[Yes, is there anything wrong?] Shiro wrote. </p><p>\"Maybe not for you, but this loser would drag you down.\" Madison said pointing her finger at Lyrica. </p><p>Lyrica shrunk back, not daring to meet her eyes. </p><p class=\"esojpv\"></p><p>Shiro frowned seeing her confidence shrinking once more. </p><p>[I\'m a level 21 Ice mage. I can make up for what she lacks.] Shiro wrote down as her surroundings started to drop in temperature. </p><p>\"Even as a level 21 Ice Mage, you\'ll run out of MP eventually. The loser here will just draw in more enemies and cause you to suffer losses.\" Madison said not relenting. </p><p>[And how would you know that?] </p><p>\"I know because she was in my party once.\" Madison said as she glared at Lyrica causing her to shrink back further. </p><p>Shiro paused as she realised that this was a prime opportunity. </p><p>[In 1 Dungeon run. I can guarantee that she levels up to 12 at least. That should prove her worth.] Shiro wrote down as Madison laughed. </p><p>\"Level 12? EXP is calculated in terms of contribution in the party. With a hindrance like her, it would take forever to level her up once.\" Madison said. </p><p>[I can guarantee her a high contribution percentage easily.] Shiro smiled. </p><p class=\"esojpv\"></p><p>\"Big words for a little girl.\" Madison said seeing what Shiro wrote. </p><p>[How about this then. I want you and 2 of your friends to fill in the gap in our team. Me and Lyrica will proceed with the Dungeon. We\'ll have a single day inside the dungeon or an hour outside. If I don\'t get her level to at least level 12, I\'ll serve under you and help you level up to 20 instead.] Shiro wrote down as both Lyrica and Madison felt their jaws drop. </p><p>\"S-S-Shiro?!\" Lyrica said shocked at what Shiro was wagering. </p><p>\'Having a level 21 assist me will make me level up much faster.\' Madison thought. </p><p>\"What do I have to do if I lose the bet.\" She asked. </p><p>Shiro smiled as she knew she had Madison hooked. </p><p>[For 5 days in a week, you\'ll help me and Lyrica fill the numbers needed to enter a dungeon.] </p><p>\"5 Days… 3 at most.\" Madison said as Shiro nodded. Being able to enter the Dungeon 3 days in a week was worth it. </p><p>\'Even if I lose, 3 days isn\'t too bad.\' Madison thought. </p><p class=\"esojpv\"></p><p>[We\'ll sign an agreement later so neither of us can go back on our words.] Shiro wrote down as she remembered the school allowing bets but they must be under a contract. </p><p>\"Alright. I just hope you don\'t back out.\" Madison replied. </p><p>[Don\'t worry I won\'t. We\'ll do the bet today since the Dungeon Exploration class will start soon.] </p><p>Shiro gestured for Lyrica to follow. </p><p>\'Heh, just a kid in the end. I\'m an Ice system focused mage. My magic can help lock down monsters making it easier for my teammates to kill them. This is basically a one-sided bet.\' Shiro thought with a grin. </p><p>That and also the fact that there was a slight loophole in the agreement. She never stated how many times they\'ll be running the dungeon in a day. A day is 24 hours, she can spend 24 days in the dungeon if she wanted. </p><p>As they left the food court, Lyrica couldn\'t help but be anxious. </p><p>\"Shiro, you shouldn\'t have done that. EXP is calculated in contributions. I doubt I\'ll be able to get enough contributions to level up twice. Not to mention, you\'ll basically become her servant!\" Lyrica said sounding anxious. </p><p>[Don\'t worry about it. It\'s only till level 20.] Shiro grinned. </p><p class=\"esojpv\"></p><p>\"How can I not worry!? The average for level 20 is 16 to 18 years old. You\'ll have to help her for at least 2 years or more!\" </p><p>[I\'ll be making the dual ended sword for you using my Ice. My INT is pretty high so it should help you in terms of contribution. You\'ll be killing the monsters while I\'ll be restraining them. This way, you should be able to get enough contribution.] Shiro wrote down. </p><p>\"But your freedom is at stake!?\" </p><p>[Oh please. If I can level up to 21 even though I\'m 13 years old, I\'m bound to have a few tricks up my sleeve.] Shiro said shrugging her shoulders. </p><p>\'Well, the truth is that I reached level 21 in just a few days.\' Shiro thought. </p><p>\"Even so. That\'s your freedom at stake for 3 fill-ins.\" Lyrica frowned. </p><p>[It\'s just till level 20. If anything, I\'m counting on you.] Shiro grinned. </p><p>\"Ha… You make reaching level 20 quickly sound so easy.\" Lyrica sighed. </p><p>[Don\'t worry about it too much, just focus on increasing contributions later when we do the Dungeon.] </p><p class=\"esojpv\"></p><p>### </p><p>\"You didn\'t cower out.\" Madison said as she had her arms crossed. </p><p>[Neither did you.] Shiro wrote down as she walked towards her. </p><p>Lyrica walked behind Shiro as she tried to muster up the courage to face everyone with her head held high. However, her nerves got the better of her as she started to shrink herself a little again. </p><p>\'Haaa…. This girl has a long way to go.\' Shiro thought with a weary smile. </p><p>\"So I\'m the observer for this bet. Madison Wilcroft and her two friends will agree to fill up Shiro and Lyrica Valenstaine\'s party for 3 days every week. </p><p>In return, should Shiro and Lyrica Valenstaine fail their side of the bet, Shiro will help Madison Wilcroft until she\'s reached level 20. Is that correct?\" The teacher said as Shiro nodded. </p><p>\"Since I have received the confirmation, please sign the contract as you won\'t be able to go back onto your word until both parties have agreed.\" The teacher said as both Shiro and Madison signed the contract. </p><p>\"The bet shall start the moment you enter the Dungeon.\" The teacher called out after authenticating the contract. </p><p class=\"esojpv\"></p><p>Shiro added the three people in front of her to the party. </p><p>[Shiro LVL 21 – Ice Mage] Party Leader </p><p>[Lyrica LVL 10 – Elven Swordswoman] </p><p>[Madison LVL 14 – Swordswoman] </p><p>[July LVL 13 – Mage] </p><p>[Karol LVL 13 – Swordswoman] </p><p>Seeing that everyone is in a party, Shiro nodded and entered the Dungeon. </p><p>[Serpent\'s Cavern 1F] </p><p>\'Serpent\'s Cavern is a level 12 Dungeon meaning the Boss should be around level 15 give or take.\' Shiro thought as she pulled out the sword handle the teacher gave her before. </p><p class=\"esojpv\"></p><p>*CRRR </p><p>Ice froze over both ends of the handle as Shiro threw the sword over to Lyrica. </p><p>\"We\'ll stay here and wait. Hopefully, you don\'t waste too much of our time and come back.\" Madison sneered as Shiro only shrugged. </p><p>[Come on Lyrica.] Shiro wrote as Lyrica nodded. </p><p>Leaving Madison, July and Karol behind, Shiro and Lyrica dashed into the caverns. </p><p>The caverns were oddly lit up yet still dark as they couldn\'t see too far ahead of them. </p><p>Shiro and Lyrica dashed through the caverns without stopping as per agreed on. Shiro\'s speed was much higher than Lyrica\'s so she slowed down just to made sure they were together. </p><p>[As we agreed before, I\'ll lock down the serpents and you decapitate them ok? Quick and simple.] Shiro showed Lyrica the note as she nodded. </p><p>Shiro turned her focus in front of her as two serpents were being picked up on the Minimap. </p><p class=\"esojpv\"></p><p>Shiro quickly made two Ice spears as she threw them towards the Serpents. </p><p>Missing the serpent\'s bodies, the spears created an arc that locked them in place. </p><p>[Cave Serpent LVL 10] </p><p>[Cave Serpent LVL 8] </p><p>Without needing to be reminded, Lyrica already know what to do. </p><p>She slid on the ground slightly as she twirled the blade in a spinning motion.

I levelled up!!!!\" Lyrica cried out in happiness and hugged Shiro whilst ignoring the cold. </p><p>Shiro smiled wearily seeing Lyrica\'s enthusiasm. </p><p>[I know. Come on, let\'s get as many levels as we can for you. My MP can still hold up for a while.] Shiro replied holding up the notepad. </p><p>\"Alright!\" Lyrica replied as Shiro refroze the sword to make sure it kept its sharpness. </p><p class=\"esojpv\"></p><p>After clearing out a majority of the beasts that were in front of them, Lyrica didn\'t manage to level up again. Most of the mobs were below LVL 10 making the EXP gain lower. </p><p>[We\'ll just kill the obelisk guardian then. That should level you up to 12.] Shiro wrote down as Lyrica was panting heavily due to how much she had been moving. </p><p>\"Can we handle it?\" She said taking a short break. </p><p>[We should be able to. Though I\'ll have to let my MP regenerate to full. You should take this chance to recover some of your stamina as well.] </p><p>\"Hey Shiro. Isn\'t this bad for me? Like, I\'m levelling up quickly but my experience would be limited.\" Lyrica said after a while. </p><p>[It\'s good that you know. However, this is just to get your level up to par with everyone else so they don\'t look down on you. Afterwards, we\'ll be able to challenge Dungeons 3 days a week with the trio filling up the missing spots.] Shiro replied. </p><p>\"But 3 runs per week is still a little short. I wish I can get more experience.\" Lyrica replied with a sigh. </p><p>[When did I ever say we\'re going to do a single run a day? I said 3 days a week and never specified how many times they had to accompany us. For all we know, they could accompany us for 24 days inside the Dungeon or 24hrs outside. A single day.] Shiro showed Lyrica her note with a grin. </p><p>\"Hahaha, Shiro that\'s mean.\" Lyrica chuckled seeing the trap Shiro laid out for the trio. </p><p class=\"esojpv\"></p><p>\"But wouldn\'t they retaliate?\" Lyrica asked. </p><p>[Nope. It\'s part of the contract after all. They can only blame themselves for not reading carefully. Not to mention, this missy here is a level 21 while they haven\'t even Classed Up yet.] </p><p>\"Sometimes I wonder if you\'re really a 13-year-old Shiro. You seem so much more mature than I am.\" Lyrica said as Shiro shrugged. </p><p>[The physical body doesn\'t represent the mentality. One can be old yet have the heart of a child. Or be young and have the mindset of an a.d.u.l.t.] Shiro wrote down as Lyrica nodded in agreement. </p><p>\"Shiro is a smart, scheming and is a powerful person. In a good way of course.\" Lyrica grinned. </p><p>\'And you are a hopeless person who needs guidance.\' Shiro thought with a smile but didn\'t say out loud. She had a feeling that Lyrica will become someone great as long as she got the help she needed. </p><p>This whim of her\'s may prove to be more beneficial than she had expected. </p>'),(220,10,'Chapter 11 Winning The Bet',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>[Giant Rock Serpent LVL 15 – Elite] </p><p>\"…\" </p><p>[…] </p><p>\"You didn\'t need to write the three dots.\" Lyrica whispered over to Shiro. </p><p>[I didn\'t. But I still did in the end.] Shiro grinned. </p><p>\"Are you sure we can take that on? My attacks will hardly work on rock.\" Lyrica asked as they were currently hiding behind a large boulder. </p><p>[I\'ll use a hammer I have in my storage. What I need you to do is to rack up contributions so you can get some EXP as well.] Shiro wrote down. </p><p>[When the fight starts, I want you to see if you can hit it at any weak joint. If you can\'t, try to use the sword to lock it down.] </p><p>\"Alright. But how would I do that?\" </p><p>[How else? Stab it through the mouth.] Shiro replied rolling her eyes. </p><p class=\"kypyss\"></p><p>\"Stab it through the mouth?! That\'s really dangerous!\" Lyrica whispered over. </p><p>[You can also stab it in the anus. I\'ve tried it with a bear and it worked wonders.] Shiro suggested. </p><p>\'Is this girl serious?\' Lyrica thought hearing the suggestion. </p><p>\"Erm, Shiro. Stabbing a monster through the anus isn\'t the most lady-like thing you can do you know?\" Lyrica said. </p><p>[And? We\'re here to kill that monster. Not take it out on a dinner date.] Shiro wrote down. </p><p>\"…True.\" Lyrica replied after a short pause. </p><p>[Alright, when I draw its aggro, you attack. Got it?] </p><p>Lyrica nodded as Shiro took out the hammer she received from the boss back in the first Dungeon. </p><p>The hammer needed 60 STR but Shiro had just enough. 35 STR from base stats and the extra 25 from equipment. This brought her up STR to exactly 60. </p><p class=\"kypyss\"></p><p>[Fire Spirit Empowered Hammer (Blue) LVL20 </p><p>Requirements: 60 STR </p><p>+30 Blunt Damage </p><p>+15 Momentum Boost </p><p>+15 Fire Element </p><p>-10 Attack Speed </p><p>Passive Skill – Reduced Weight </p><p>Reduced Weight – Reduces the Weight of the weapon by 30%.] </p><p>Lyrica didn\'t know what kind of hammer it was but she knew it was a good weapon. However, her most important question was; </p><p class=\"kypyss\"></p><p>\'How the hell is she carrying that hammer?! Isn\'t she a mage?!\' </p><p>Hammers, Axes, Greatswords and other heavy weapons had a requirement on STR. </p><p>As a mage, Shiro\'s STR had to be low, yet she\'s carrying this weapon without problems. </p><p>Looking at the 4-meter-long serpent with grey scales, Shiro readjusted her grip on the hammer. </p><p>She stepped hard as she dragged the hammer behind her. </p><p>Sprinting towards the serpent at full speed, Shiro started to freeze the ground beneath her as her momentum increase further. </p><p>Hitting the peak of her speed, Shiro elevated the Ice and made a ramp. </p><p>\"It\'s hammer time!\" Shiro shouted with a grin even though Lyrica couldn\'t hear her. </p><p>To make sure she dealt the most amount of damage, she activated the skill that came with her [Fire Spirit Infused Power Gauntlet (Blue) LVL20]. The skill was [Power Boost] which gave her an 100% increase to damage and +15 STR for 20 seconds at the cost of receiving 30% more damage during the 20 seconds it was activated. </p><p class=\"kypyss\"></p><p>Jumping off the ramp, Shiro twisted her body as she used her entire strength to smash the hammer against the serpent\'s head. </p><p>*BOOM!!!! </p><p>The collision caused a miniature shockwave to explode out as the serpent recoiled backwards. </p><p>*SSSSS!!!! </p><p>It hissed at her with a glare. </p><p>Wrapping its body up into a coil, the serpent\'s head shot towards Shiro as if the head itself was spring locked. </p><p>Shiro flicked her finger upwards creating a ramp. The ramp had a gentle curve which redirected the serpent\'s attack. </p><p>The ramp redirected the serpent\'s attack in a clockwise direction so Shiro twisted her body anticlockwise. The hammer and the head met up as the two forces clashed once more. </p><p>\'Am I even needed here?\' Lyrica thought to herself as she knew Shiro could probably kill the boss on her own. </p><p class=\"kypyss\"></p><p>Even though she was thinking that, her body bolted into action the moment she recognised the fact that Shiro had the serpent\'s aggro. </p><p>She kept her body low as she twirled her dual ended blades. </p><p>Stabbing the blade into the ground, she vaulted herself upwards as she slashed at the back of the serpent. </p><p>The slashes only made a few shallow scratches as Lyrica landed and retreated. </p><p>However, she had accidentally retreated into the path of the tail as she shut her eyes and brought up her hands to protect herself. </p><p>*CRRRR!!!! </p><p>Lyrica heard a freezing sound as she reopened her eyes. </p><p>The tail was frozen a few meters away from hitting her. She turned towards Shiro and saw that she was crouched as a trail of Ice extended from her palms towards the tail. </p><p>\"T-Thanks.\" Lyrica replied stuttering slightly as her nerves were a little tense right now. </p><p class=\"kypyss\"></p><p>Shiro nodded as she kicked back and hit the serpent on the side of the jaw. Following her momentum, the hammer stuck the serpent on the underside of the jaw. </p><p>\'Wow!\' Lyrica was amazed at how Shiro was fighting. All of her movements seem natural as it didn\'t matter if she was using a foreign weapon or not. It was as if she knew the best ways to utilise each of their strengths. </p><p>Shiro looked at Lyrica before holding up a finger and did a pushing up motion. </p><p>\"….Fine.\" Lyrica said as she made a slightly bitter face. </p><p>Making sure she had a firm hold on the dual ended blade, Lyrica ran behind the serpent as she looked for the anus. </p><p>She started to become fl.u.s.tered after not being able to find it. </p><p>\"I can\'t find it!\" She shouted out as Shiro looked over at her. </p><p>Blocking another strike of the serpent, Shiro became slightly annoyed at the serpent. </p><p>*BANG! </p><p class=\"kypyss\"></p><p>She hit the jaw of the serpent as she sent it stumbling backwards. </p><p>Holding the hammer with one hand, Shiro started scribbled something down before kicking the notepad towards Lyrica. </p><p>In the time she was writing, Shiro dodge every one of the serpent\'s attacks without much problems. </p><p>Lyrica picked up the note as she read what Shiro wrote down. </p><p>[The cloaca or anus of a serpent is 3/4ths down the body. You\'ll have to lift up a scale and the hole should be present. There is only one hole so you can\'t miss.] </p><p>\'How does she know where the anus is so well?!\' Lyrica thought in her mind. However, she trusted Shiro\'s knowledge so she took the chance to search for the serpent\'s cloaca. It was made easier due to Shiro freezing the tail as it didn\'t move too much. </p><p>It didn\'t take long for her to find the scale that lifted up and expose the anus. </p><p>Lyrica held her breath as she tightened the grip on her blade. </p><p>\'I\'m sorry.\' She apologised as she plunged the blade in with as much strength as she could. </p><p class=\"kypyss\"></p><p>*SSSSAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! </p><p>The serpent screamed as Lyrica backed off. The serpent\'s body rampaged as it broke the Ice locking down the tail easily. The serpent locked onto Lyrica instantly as it forgot about Shiro. </p><p>Seeing the back exposed, Shiro dashed towards the blade. </p><p>\"Open those cheeks for this miss!!\" Shiro shouted as she uppercutted the hammer into the blade. </p><p>The force caused the blade to shoot through the body of the serpent and come out the torso after piercing the heart. </p><p>The serpent writhed around in pain for a short while before collapsing. </p><p>Shiro supported the hammer on her shoulders as she had a happy smile on her face.

I don\'t need them.\" Lyrica replied as she sat down and rested. </p><p>Getting confirmation, Shiro checked through all the gear that would be helpful for neither her or Lyrica and recycled them all. What she was left with was 2 green pieces beneficial for Lyrica. </p><p>On the other hand, Shiro\'s harvest was a green piece and the Blue Accessory. </p><p>The pieces for Lyrica was as follows. </p><p>[Serpent\'s Arm Guard (Green) LVL 10 </p><p>+10 STR </p><p class=\"kypyss\"></p><p>+5 AGI] </p><p>[Serpent\'s Scaled Boots (Green) LVL 10 </p><p>+15 AGI] </p><p>Both of these items focused on the STR and AGI stats which was good for adventurers that use a sword. </p><p>As for the equipment Shiro chose for herself, they were as follows. </p><p>[Serpent\'s Head Crown (Green) LVL 15 </p><p>+15 INT </p><p>+5 STR] </p><p>This was better than her previous headgear which was: </p><p class=\"kypyss\"></p><p>[Fire Spirit Crown (Green) LVL 10 </p><p>+10 INT] </p><p>Switching out the gear, Shiro experienced an upgrade of +5 in INT and a +5 in STR. </p><p>In addition to this, the Blue drop from the boss was a head accessory. </p><p>[Crown Serpent\'s Glare (Blue) LVL 15 – Head Accessory </p><p>+15 INT </p><p>+10 Mental Resistance </p><p>Skill – Lesser Fear </p><p>Lesser Fear – Focus your gaze on a person or monster lower level than you and inflict a Lesser Fear Status.

These two were the best for you since the stat bonus they give are beneficial for using the sword.] </p><p>\"Thank you.\" Lyrica smiled as received the two pieces of equipment. </p><p>[Shall we challenge the floor 2 boss?] Shiro wrote down with a smile. </p><p>\"Floor 2? I don\'t know. I feel like it\'s more beneficial if I try to fight it fairly. I can gain more experience that way.\" Lyrica replied as Shiro nodded. </p><p>[Then after we clear out the second floor, I\'ll freeze the boss and we\'ll use the obelisk to return back to floor 1 ok?] </p><p>\"No problems.\" Lyrica smiled. </p><p>### </p><p>Clearing out the second floor was an easy task. Most of the monsters that were present on this floor were level 10 to 13 Rock Serpents. </p><p>To fight these Rock Serpents, Shiro would use Lesser Fear on the monsters whilst Lyrica would stab them through the head. This proved beneficial as Lyrica\'s contribution was always above 75% giving her most of the EXP. </p><p class=\"kypyss\"></p><p>When they cleared the floor out by roughly 60%, Lyrica levelled up fulfilling their side of the bet in only a few hours. </p><p>Unfortunately, none of the drops could be used so Shiro recycled everything. </p><p>As previously agreed on, Shiro froze the obelisk guardian while they used the obelisk to return back to the first floor. </p><p>Walking calmly back to the three girls, Shiro and Lyrica saw Madison\'s bitter face as Lyrica couldn\'t help but feel slightly giddy inside. The foreign feeling of proving people wrong was amazing. </p><p>[So I take it as our win?] Shiro smiled showing Madison the note. </p><p>\"…\" Madison frowned in annoyance as she glared at Lyrica. </p><p>\'It\'s all her fault! Who told her to level up, she should have just stayed as a low level loser.\' She thought. </p><p>Shiro frowned as she could feel Madison\'s hostility. </p><p>The temperature started to drop as Shiro looked at her coldly. </p><p class=\"kypyss\"></p><p>[Make a move, go on. I dare you.] Shiro wrote as she smiled with a menacing aura. Madison shivered seeing that smile and quickly ran out the Dungeon with her two friends. </p><p>Shiro shrugged as the temperature returned back to normal. </p><p>As they exited the Dungeon, the teacher walked up to Shiro. </p><div class=\"adsbox\"></div><p>\"As you have won your side of the bet, Madison Wilcroft will fill up your party numbers for 3 days a week.\" The teacher said as he passed her contract to her. </p><p>Shiro nodded taking the contract. </p><p>[Thank you.] She wrote down as she left with Lyrica. </p><p>After walking for a while, Shiro couldn\'t help but notice Lyrica\'s conflicting gaze. </p><p>[What\'s wrong?] </p><p>\"Well… It\'s just that you basically put a few years of your life on the line just so that we can run Dungeons.

Yet for me, it has become something more.\" Lyrica muttered. </p><p>[Don\'t sound so depressing. We just got our chance to run Dungeons for 3 days a week.] Shiro smiled patting Lyrica\'s shoulders. </p><p>\"You\'re right.\" Lyrica replied as they walked home. </p><p>Shiro gave Lyrica a wave before entering her room. Undressing herself, Shiro wore just a plain shirt and underwear as she grabbed the tablet and laid on the bed. </p><p>\'Since I\'m thinking of making a commission for Lyrica\'s weapon, I need to find the prices.\' She thought as she searched up the web. </p><p>After scouring around for a while, Shiro found the Blacksmith\'s website. </p><p>\'Hm… It\'s not too expensive.\' Shiro thought seeing the prices. </p><p>[Average Commission for Green Grade Custom Weapons] </p><p>Must provide materials yourself. </p><p>Basic deposit: 5,000 USD </p><p>LVL 5 – 5,000 -&gt; 10,000 USD </p><p>LVL 10 – 11,000 -&gt; 50,000 USD </p><p>LVL 15 – 50,000 -&gt; 75,000 USD </p><p>LVL 20 – 100,000 -&gt; 200,000 USD </p><p>Over LVL 20 – 200,000 USD + </p><div class=\"adsbox\"></div>'),(221,10,'Chapter 12 Blacksmith',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>[I\'ll be exploring the town a little today so I won\'t be back until late.] Shiro wrote down as Lyrica nodded. </p><p>\"Ok, take care Shiro.\" She replied. </p><p>Leaving the school in her uniform, Shiro walked towards the Blacksmiths association. </p><p>On her way there, she saw a familiar figure patrolling the streets. </p><p>Walking towards him with a light smile, she tapped his arm like the first time she saw him. </p><p>[Thank you for your help last time Liam.] Shiro wrote down while Liam looked towards her. </p><p>\"Ah so it was you miss Shiro.\" Liam smiled. </p><p>\"You\'ve already learnt how to read and write?! That was fast.\" Liam complimented. </p><p>[I had a friend to help me study after all.] </p><p>\"Hou~ Already made a friend huh. Nice going.\" Liam smiled. </p><p class=\"vxulyh\"></p><p>[Anyways, I was here just to say thanks so I won\'t bother you on your duty any longer.] Shiro smiled giving him a wave before leaving. </p><p>Liam only smiled before he carried on his duty. </p><p>Reaching the Blacksmiths association, Shiro walked up to the counter. </p><p>[Hello, I would like to check the prices for commissioning a custom weapon.] </p><p>\"For that, you\'ll need to ask the individual craftsmen for their prices depending on what your weapon is. The craftsmen are over to the left.\" The receptionist said simply. </p><p>Walking through the area of craftsmen, she would occasionally check out their wares and see the quality of the weapons they\'re producing. </p><p>\'Hmm… each of these weapons are in poor condition.\' Shiro thought examining the weapons. </p><p>Picking out the blacksmith who seemed to have the best quality, Shiro lined up. </p><p>However, the queue moved at such an abysmal pace that even Shiro was getting impatient. </p><p class=\"vxulyh\"></p><p>In the time she was waiting, Shiro decided to pull up her tablet and browse the net on information around the surrounding Dungeons. </p><p>\'There are around 28 E ranked Dungeons nearby. Each of these Dungeons ranged from the lowest being level 2 and the highest being level 20. The Dungeon I was in was a level 10 to 15 Dungeon that mutated into a level 20 Dungeon.\' Shiro thought reading about the Dungeon. </p><p>\'As for D ranks, there are 15 Dungeons. 5 being level 21 to level 35. 3 being level 35 to level 40. And finally, the last seven are level 40 to level 50.\' </p><p>She was currently level 21 so she was still a while away from level 50. </p><p>Waiting in line took an hour before Shiro finally reached the front. </p><p>\"What do you need? Keep it quick.\" The person who said this was a man who looked like he was in his early 20\'s. He had flaming red hair and red eyes. His hair was short and spiky. Measuring around 6ft 4 and looking around 20 to 25 years old in age, he wore a blacksmith\'s uniform. </p><p>*DING DING DING DING </p><p>He hammered away at the metal rhythmically. </p><p>[Helion LVL 50 – Pugilist] </p><p class=\"vxulyh\"></p><p>Shiro wrote something down before tapping his arm. </p><p>\"If ya need something just say it.\" He said not turning around. </p><p>\'In hindsight, I should have brought Lyrica with me.\' Shiro thought. </p><p>Shiro decided to walk around the bench as she stood in front of him and showed him the note. </p><p>[I want to commission a custom weapon for my friend. The handle should be around 30cm with two blades attached to either side of the handle. The blades themselves should resemble longswords. Also I\'m mute so I can\'t talk.] </p><p>*CLANG! </p><p>Helion dropped his hammer immediately seeing the girl in front of him. She had clear azure eyes and long flowing black hair. Her height was 5ft 3 and a modest body build. Holding the sign in front of him, she seemed almost defenceless. </p><p>Seeing his reaction, Shiro furrowed her brows slightly and wrote down another sentence. </p><p>[Excuse me?] </p><p class=\"vxulyh\"></p><p>Shiro waved her hand in front of his face causing him to snap out of it. </p><p>\"Ah em. Well, er can you tell me what you mean by the weapon?\" Helion said as he coughed slightly. </p><p>Shiro took out the handle and remade the Ice dual ended blade Lyrica used. </p><p>[The blade looks like this.] Shiro wrote down handing him the weapon. </p><p>\"Hmm, it\'s definitely an uncommon weapon.\" Helion said whilst he inspected the weapon. </p><p>\"What level is your friend?\" He asked. </p><p>[Level 12.] </p><p>\"Level 12… So it should be more worthwhile to make a level 15 weapon rather than 10. Hmm… What types of attributes does your friend need the most?\" He asked looking over at her. </p><p>Seeing Shiro look down and start writing on the notepad, he couldn\'t help but admire her a little longer. </p><p class=\"vxulyh\"></p><p>[I\'m estimating the stats she needs are AGI, STR and DEX since she\'s a swordswoman.] Shiro wrote down. </p><p>[So what materials do I need?] She asked. </p><p>\"It really depends. The higher level the source of the material, the higher level the weapon will be. So I\'d say you\'re looking for serpents scales, scorpion stingers, bear bones, a core and a E rank mana stone.\" He replied as he started to draft up a design. </p><p>\"What do you think?\" He asked eagerly. </p><p>Shiro was slightly taken aback at how fast he worked. </p><p>The design showed the bear bones being used as the handle with the core and E rank mana stone slotted in the bone marrow. The scorpion stingers and the serpent scales mixed together to make the blades causing the dual ended sword itself to look menacing. </p><p>[How much is it?] </p><p>\"Erm it\'s all on–\" </p><p>*Tap tap tap </p><p class=\"vxulyh\"></p><p>Shiro tapped three times on the notepad to get his attention on the note. She wasn\'t about to let him say it\'s all on me. </p><p>\"5,000 USD deposit and it should be around 75,000 USD.\" Helion replied as to not displease the young girl in front of him. </p><p>[Ok, give me a list of the number of materials so I can keep an eye out for them.] Shiro wrote down while Helion took a pen and started to write the materials down. </p><p>[List Of materials] </p><p>20x Scorpion Stingers </p><p>50x Rock Serpent Scales </p><p>2x Tough Bear Bones </p><p>5x Red Gems </p><p>1x E Rank Mana Stone </p><p class=\"vxulyh\"></p><p>[Thank you.] Shiro wrote down before she started to walk away. </p><p>\'Rock Serpent Scales can be obtained in the Dungeon near the school.

A greatsword is more common so it should fetch a decent price.\' Shiro thought. </p><p>\'If I want to get the most out of this weapon, I\'ll need to factor in a few variables to make sure the price goes up.\' Shiro thought bringing up her tablet and searched for any combat events that will happen soon. </p><p>\'There is a Faction recruitment in a months time that will test the adventurers. I can probably hype up the weapon using this as leverage. Not to mention, the skill has a 100% increase in strength and 50% increase to damage. The -80% speed can be made up for using other equipment but the skill itself is pretty good even for people around level 30.\' Shiro thought as she searched for a few key items she needed to take notice of. </p><p>Finding everything she needed, Shiro had a calculating glint in her eye. </p><p>[I wish to put a weapon on sale.] Shiro wrote down and showed it to the receptionist. </p><p>\"If you wish to put an item on sale, please go to the second floor and ask the receptionist there.\" The receptionist lady replied. </p><p class=\"vxulyh\"></p><p>Shiro nodded as she looked for a set of stairs. It didn\'t take too long since the staircase wasn\'t hidden at all. </p><p>Arriving on the second floor, Shiro was surprised at the sheer amount of people selling miscellaneous items. </p><p>\'Maybe it\'s because the blacksmith\'s association is nearby.\' She thought. </p><p>Clearing her head of these thoughts, she walked towards the receptionist. </p><p>[I wish to put a weapon on sale.] Shiro showed the receptionist the same note. </p><p>\"Understood, please follow me to the inspection room.\" The receptionist replied, gesturing at Shiro for her to follow. </p><p>Waiting in the inspection room, Shiro waited for a few minutes until a woman walked in. </p><p>[Hilda LVL 35 – Ranger] </p><p>\"So I heard you wanted to sell a weapon young girl.

Since the weapon is a more commonly used weapon, the prices would increase. </p><p>\"Little girl, are you sure you want to put this weapon on sale?\" Hilda asked looking over at Shiro. </p><p>[Yes I do. I\'m an Ice mage so I have no use for a greatsword.] </p><p class=\"vxulyh\"></p><p>\"That is true… How about this, the auction house will give you 200,000 USD upfront if you sell this to us.\" Hilda said as Shiro shook her head. </p><p>\'Does she think I\'m just your everyday little girl?\' Shiro thought. </p><p>[I wish to put it on bid so I can get the most out of this weapon. I still need to purchase some materials after this.] </p><p>\"What if we trade you 200,000 USD and the materials you need for the greatsword.\" Hilda asked. </p><p>[400,000 USD and materials.] </p><p>Hilda frowned at the price. </p><p>\"Too much. 200,000 USD and materials for the weapon.\" </p><p>[Miss Hilda, there is a Faction recruitment in a months time. Using that as an excuse, you can hype up the weapons actual value for more than 500,000 USD.] Shiro wrote down and smiled calmly. </p><p>She crossed her legs whilst waiting for Hilda\'s reply. </p><p class=\"vxulyh\"></p><p>\"Even so there is no guarantee that it will surpass 500,000 USD. 300,000 USD and materials and not a bit less.\" Hilda said as she realised the girl in front of her wasn\'t going to get tricked. </p><p>[Miss Hilda. May I remind you that the auction house isn\'t my only way to selling items. I can in fact wait until the Faction Recruitment to sell this. I wonder how much money I\'ll get by them?] Shiro smiled with slightly narrowed eyes. </p><p>Hilda became slightly nervous inside as Shiro was correct. They could make a fortune using the event. </p><p>\"I\'ll have to ask my superiors about this.\" Hilda said as Shiro nodded. </p><p>[I\'ll wait 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, the deal is off.] </p><p>Hilda nodded, quickly leaving to call her superiors. </p><p>Shiro sat there calmly while she waited. Naturally, there is also the chance for them to try rob her, but she\'s already set up a few freezing traps to slow them down. She\'s also able to escape through a few narrow places using Faded Snow Movement. </p><p>Hilda returned after around 3 minutes. </p><p>\"My superiors have agreed to your price of 400,000 USD and materials. Provided that they aren\'t too expensive.\" </p><p class=\"vxulyh\"></p><p>[I need, 30x Scorpion\'s Poisoned Stinger. 50x Rock Serpent\'s Crown Scales. 2x Hobgoblin\'s Bones. 5x Element Gems. And a D rank mana stone.] Shiro wrote down causing Hilda to narrowed her eyes lightly. </p><p>\"Too much. 300,000 USD and these materials.\" </p><p>[Then the deal is off.] Shiro wrote down decisively as she stood up and walked towards the door. </p><p>\"Wait!\" Hilda called up surprised that Shiro was so decisive. </p><p>[Miss Hilda. 450,000 USD and the materials. Not a bit less.] Shiro smiled. She had the upper hand in this arrangement so she had to take advantage of it. </p><p>Hilda frowned seeing the price rise once more. The quota her superior gave her was 500,000 USD and the materials she needed. </p><p>However, the total cost of materials must not surpass 150,000 USD. </p><p>\"450,000 USD is fine. Though the materials are a little too much.\" Hilda said after a deep breath. </p><p>[Then how about 20x Scorpion\'s Poisoned Stinger. 50x Rock Serpent\'s Crown Scales. 2x Hobgoblin\'s Bones. 5x Reinforcement Gems and a D rank mana stone?] Shiro wrote down subtracting 10x Scorpion\'s Poisoned Stinger and downgraded the Element Gems slightly into Reinforcement Gems. </p><p class=\"vxulyh\"></p><p>\"That is fine.\" Hilda nodded as it was within her quota. </p><p>Finishing the trade, Shiro confirmed the items she received before leaving. </p><p>\'Hehehe, my harvest isn\'t too bad.\' Shiro thought with a grin. </p><p>The materials needed originally was the E rank versions of the materials she received in the end. This should make the weapon Helion creates much better and have a good chance of reaching Blue in ranks. The level requirement may also increase, but he can mix it with E rank materials to decrease the requirement. </p><p>Of course, it\'s also depended on the craftsmanship of the blacksmith himself. </p>'),(222,10,'Chapter 13 Blacksmith 2',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Shiro made her way back to Helion as she queued up once more. </p><p>\"Tell me what you need and keep it short.\" </p><p>Once again, Helion greeted with the same greeting without looking back. </p><p>Shiro shook her head as she walked around like last time and showed him the note. </p><p>[I\'ve got everything I need.] She wrote down. </p><p>\"Eh? It\'s you.\" Helion said surprised at how quick she came back and immediately stopped everything he was doing. </p><p>Shiro started to place the D rank variants of each material onto the table. </p><p>[Would these be ok? They\'re a rank higher.] Shiro wrote down as Helion started to examine the materials. </p><p>\"Yeah they would actually. I can probably mix some of this with metals to make the E rank weapon and use the remainder to make the D rank weapon. These should help carry your friend for a while before he or she needs to change weapons. Ah also, I need an E rank mana stone for the E rank weapon.\" Helion said as Shiro nodded. </p><p>[I\'ll be counting on you then. How much do I need to deposit first? Market price please.] Shiro wrote down. </p><p class=\"mmlabk\"></p><p>\"For an E rank custom weapon would be 5,000 USD. For the D rank it would be 50,000 USD.\" Helion replied with a weary smile. He wanted to get on her good side by giving her some benefits but it seems like his intentions were seen through. </p><p>[Ok, I can give the money straight away. Do you know how much the final price would be for both weapons?] Shiro asked. </p><p>\"Around 300,000 USD for the D rank weapon and 75,000 USD for the E rank.\" </p><p>\"But if it\'s too much for you I can give you a little discount.\" Helion offered. </p><p>[No it\'s fine. I can afford it.] Shiro shook her head. </p><p>Helion could only smile bitterly. The only time he wanted a customer to not have enough USD for his items she actually had enough. </p><p>\"Alright, shall I build it today?\" He asked as Shiro thought about it and nodded. </p><p>[Please.] </p><p>Helion nodded as he turned to the queue. </p><p class=\"mmlabk\">The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld[.]com</p><p>\"I\'ll be doing a big commission today! Come back tomorrow!\" He shouted out as the queue dispersed. </p><p>Shiro raised an eyebrow seeing this. </p><p>[They seem rather obedient.] Shiro wrote down. </p><p>\"If they\'re not, I can just blacklist them.\" Helion shrugged. </p><p>He walked back into his workshop as he started to lay out the materials. </p><p>50x Rock Serpent\'s Crown Scales, 2x Hobgoblin\'s Bones, 5x Reinforcement Gems, an assortment of different metals, E ranked mana stone and a D rank mana stone. </p><p>[Is it ok if I waited here while you work?] Shiro wrote down. </p><p>\"OF COURSE!\" Helion replied with a little too much enthusiasm. </p><p>Shiro only chuckled slightly as she pulled up a chair by the side and sat down. Crossing her legs, she rested her head on her left hand whilst her spare hand searched on the net. </p><p class=\"mmlabk\"></p><p>Shiro was currently looking at the Dungeon available around the area so she can plan the level up schedule for both her and Lyrica. </p><p>Helion paused slightly as he admired Shiro. Shaking his head, he started to work away as he brought materials out. </p><p>The process could be narrowed down to 6 main steps. </p><p>1: Forging – The step to get the metal into the desired shape. </p><p>2: Annealing – Cooling the metal over a long period of time making it soft and easy for grinding. </p><p>3: Grinding – Sharpening the edges of the metal. </p><p>4: Hardening – Heating up the metal and cooling it quickly to harden the blade. </p><p>5: Tempering – Heated up to a lower temperature than the temperature during hardening, it is cooled quickly. Repeating this step several times will allow the blade to be strong but not brittle. It will also retain some flexibility. </p><p>6: Completion – This step adds the handle, guard and pommel. It is the finishing touch needed for the weapon. </p><p class=\"mmlabk\"></p><p>But before that, he needed to make the main material for the sword. Since most of the materials are D ranked, he needed to mix it with some E rank metals to lower down the level of the final product. </p><p>Grabbing some metals, Helion heated it up in the forge until the metal was almost coloured white. </p><p>Pulling the metal out of the forge, Helion\'s face and aura became serious. </p><p>Sensing the change in aura, Shiro looked up from the tablet and watched carefully. </p><p>Grabbing the hammer, Helion\'s muscles tensed up as he raised it up above his head. </p><p>The hammer burst into orange flames just before Helion stuck it down. </p><p>*DING! DING! DING! DING! </p><p>Rhythmic hammering rang out. With each strike of the hammer, the metal was slowly flattened down. Sparks flew everywhere as Helion\'s concentration hit its peak. </p><p>Helion stomped down as it caused some of the materials to be launched up into the air. Reaching out his arm, the materials he needed magnetised over to his hand. </p><p class=\"mmlabk\"></p><p>\'Pugilist\'s ground stomp and attraction force. Ground Stomp causes the enemy to become air born for a slight moment whilst Attraction Force pulls the enemy towards you. For him to use both skills to help him make a weapon is quite innovative.\' Shiro thought with a slight smile. </p><p>When Helion used both skills, his other hand wasn\'t idle either as he continued to hammer away. </p><p>He took 5x Rock Serpent\'s Crown Scales and lined them up along the entire piece of metal. This time, he infused more mana into his hammer before he continued to hammer down with increasing speed and intensity. </p><p>Pulling the metal slightly off the metal workspace, Helion slammed the hammer on the middle of the metal as he folded it over. </p><p>Repeating the process for a few more times, Helion finished the first piece of alloy that he was going to use for one of the blades. </p><p>Helion then wrapped the alloy in a fireproof material to let the alloy cool down slowly. </p><p>He then continued to make the second alloy for the second blade that will be included in the weapon. </p><p>Repeating what he did with the first alloy, he set it aside to let it cool slowly. </p><p>While the first two alloys were cooling down, Helion started to make the 2 blades for the D rank dual ended weapon. </p><p class=\"mmlabk\"></p><p>This time, instead of mixing it with metal, Helion was patient as he heated each of the Crown Scales before hammering them together piece by piece. 20 pieces of Rock Serpent\'s Crown Scale was needed to make a single blade. </p><p>As the heap of scales were pure white due to the heat, Helion started to hammer it into shape. </p><p>Grabbing 10 pieces of Scorpion\'s Poisoned Stinger, Helion crushed the tip of the stinger and lined them up along the edge. </p><p>Shiro\'s eyes glimmered slightly when she observed how he hammered away at the materials. On point of contact, he would shift his wrist ever so slightly so that the Stingers would fold upwards and over the Scales. In between the gap, he would sew dense mana fibres melding the two materials together. </p><p>Once he finished with the two blades for the D rank weapon, he turned his attention back to the first two alloys he made for the E rank weapon. </p><p>He laid the two alloys in front of him as he pressed all five of his fingers on the workbench. Runes spread out from each of his fingers as it formed a circle around the two alloys. </p><p>Shiro could tell that Helion was speeding up the cooling process while not damaging the blade itself. </p><p>Infusing mana into the blades whilst he was cooling them down, he ensured that they didn\'t lose any of their attributes while softening up to be sharpened. </p><p>As he finished the cooling process, he set the D rank blades to experience the same cooling. </p><p class=\"mmlabk\"></p><p>During this, he took the alloys to the grinding wheel as the wheel itself was reinforced to be able to shave away at the alloy. </p><p>Sparks flew everywhere while Shiro watched in interest. It was fascinating watching a craftsman focus on their work. </p><p>Their pacing, their concentration and their finesse when making their crafts intrigued her. </p><p>When she makes her Nano craft weapons like the dagger, it was akin to pouring molten metal into a mould. </p><p>None of this intricate process was involved. </p><p>The joy of watching anything grow from almost nothing to something was calming. It was a feeling that didn\'t come with the almost instantaneous creation of her Nano craft weapons. </p><p>As Helion finished sharpening both alloys, he raised it up above his head as he examined the edge. </p><p>Nodding in satisfaction, he took the D rank blades and proceeded to sharpen them as well. </p><p>The time needed to sharpen the D rank blades were much longer than the time needed for the E rank alloys. This is due to the fact that the D rank blades retained most of their hardness even after softening them up. </p><p class=\"mmlabk\"></p><p>Now that all four blades were sharpened, Helion stuck all of them into the forge as he started to heat them back up. </p><p>After waiting for a while, he pulled out the four blades and placed them into a basin of cold water. </p><p>*CHSSSSSS </p><p>The sound of red hot material touching the cold water hissed out as the cold water boiled almost instantly. </p><p>Repeatedly heating up and cooling down the metal, Helion finished the Tempering stage. </p><p>Taking the blades to the grinder, he grinded it down one last time to give the blades a cleaner look to them. </p><p>The materials he had left were 2x Hobgoblin\'s Bones, 5x Reinforcement Gems, an E rank mana stone and a D rank mana stone. </p><p>He collected the shavings from the blades which were the result of grinding them down. </p><p>Putting the shavings into a bowl, he sat down and started to work on the bones. </p><p class=\"mmlabk\"></p><p>Cutting the bones in half down the centre, he scr.a.p.ed out all the bone marrow. </p><p>Adding a liquid to the shavings which acted like glue, he filled up the inside of the bone as he embedded 1 Reinforcement Gem and the E rank mana stone. </p><p>A neon blue light started to spread from the mana stone as roots seemed to travel long the liquid shavings. </p><p>Slotting the other half of the bone back on top, Helion covered the entire bone in the liquid shavings. </p><p>Getting the E ranked alloy blades, Helion attached them to either side of the bone handle and waited for it to set. </p><p>As the liquid shavings solidified, they formed a sort of natural grip as it made it harder for the weapon to slip out of a person\'s hand by accident. </p><p>Setting the E ranked blade aside, Helion started working on the D ranked handle. </p><p>The requirement for this was much higher as he crushed 2 of the Reinforcement Stones and mixed it with the liquid shavings. This, in turn, coloured it a greyish red. </p><p>Replacing the bone marrow with the new liquid shavings, Helion embedded the D ranked mana stone in the middle while the final 2 reinforcement stones laid on either side of the mana stone. </p><p class=\"mmlabk\">The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld[.]com</p><p>Similar to what happened with the previous weapon, neon lights started to spread from the mana stone but the amount of \'roots\' it formed was many times more than the E rank mana stone. </p><p>Doing the final touches of slotting the bone together as well as coating it in the remaining liquid shavings, Helion attached the D ranked blades to the handle. </p><p>Shiro could see the \'roots\' spread out from the handle and along the flat side of both blades. </p><p>Waiting for a while, Helion only let go of the handle when the \'roots\' carved themselves onto the blade. </p><p>\"Alright done. The products were better than expected. The E rank will cost 80,000 USD and the D rank will cost 320,000 USD.\" Helion said handing both weapons to Shiro. </p><p>[Unnamed Custom Weapon LVL 15 (Green+)] </p><p>Creator: Helion </p><p>Requirements: LVL 15 </p><p>+15 Sharpness </p><p class=\"mmlabk\"></p><p>+10 AGI </p><p>+10 DEX </p><p>+10 Poison </p><p>+15 Durability </p><p>+5 STR </p><p>[Unnamed Custom Weapon LVL 30 (Green+)] </p><p>Creator: Helion </p><p>Requirements: LVL 30, 220 STR </p><p>+40 Sharpness </p><p class=\"mmlabk\"></p><p>+20 AGI </p><p>+15 DEX </p><p>+20 Poison </p><p>+15 Piercing </p><p>+20 STR </p><p>[Thank you.

Thus leaving her with a measly 19,000 USD. </p><p>\"If you need any other weapon being commissioned, just come to me. I can guarantee I finish it in one day.\" Helion replied smiling but Shiro could see him sweat profusely from how hard he worked. </p><p class=\"mmlabk\"></p><p>[I\'ll take you up on that offer. Take care of yourself.] Shiro smiled as she walked away with the new weapons. </p><p>Helion paused seeing Shiro\'s smile. Ignoring the fact that she looked 13 to 15, her beauty was in a league of her own. Just a smile was like a cool breeze on a hot day. </p><p>Walking back to her room, Shiro took out both weapons and laid them on the table. </p><p>Looking over at the level 15 unnamed weapon. Shiro decided to name it [Dual Ended Poison Blade]. </p><p>As for the D rank weapon, she wanted to run a little experiment. </p><p>With her experiences of the Nanomancer class, she would be able to make small trinkets that don\'t exceed her current limit. But the next item she was going to make might be pushing it a little. </p><p>Lightning and metallic particles swirled around her open palms as Shiro closed her eyes. </p><p>She started to extract mana and twined them in her open palm. The mana converted into Nano bots as Shiro took out an E ranked mana stone and stuck it into the swarm of Nano bots. </p><p>The metal started to wrap around the stone itself as Shiro envisioned a blueprint she remembered from her past life. </p><p class=\"mmlabk\"></p><p>Making a few corrections so that it fit a level 30 rather than a level 200+, Shiro could feel her Mana drain at an absurd speed. </p><p>Sweat dripped from her forehead as she furrowed her brows. </p><p>\'Energy Compartment… Conversion Compartment… Distribution Vents… Mana Diffusion Compartment…\' Shiro thought as an orb was being created on her palm. </p><p>\"Fuuuu…..\" Shiro breathed out heavily as she reopened her eyes. </p><p>Glancing over at her MP, she couldn\'t help but smile bitterly at how much MP she needed for the Nanomancer class. </p><p>[MP: 200/6300] </p><p>She had to keep at lease 200MP as a fail-safe for her Disguise skill. </p><p>However, when she looked at the tiny orb that needed 6100 MP, Shiro couldn\'t help but smile. </p><p>[Nano Growth Infuser Prototype Mk 1 – LVL 20 (Blue+)] </p>'),(223,10,'Chapter 14 Nano Tech',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>[Nano Growth Infuser Prototype Mk 1 – LVL 20 (Blue+)] </p><p>Apply to a weapon at or below LVL 20.

The weapon will lose 5 levels but when evolved to the max level of the Infuser (LVL 20), its final attributes are much higher than the base value. </p><p>As this is the prototype, the weapon will only experience a slight increase in attribute growth when it reaches level 20. </p><p>The orb in Shiro\'s hands is one of the most beneficial items she could create with her Nanomancer class. It took the growth like properties of her Nanobots and it would infuse it to a weapon. </p><p>As for the reason it would evolve the weapon, it was due to the unique reaction the Nanobots had to mana. </p><p>When a person\'s level grew, the mana would also grow along with them. </p><p>The Nanobots recognised this growth and it would increase the levels of the items the host could make. However, the level will never exceed what the host\'s level was. </p><p>The [Nano Growth Infuser] was something Shiro had designed in her past life.

However, she wasn\'t able to see if it could go any further due to her death. </p><p>Her initial goal was to make a level 30 version of the Infuser. However, it seems like she\'ll be using it on the E ranked [Dual Ended Poison Blade] instead. </p><p class=\"oreqqc\"></p><p>[Skill Activated: Nano Tech Engineering Tier 1] </p><p>Although it says the skill was activated, Shiro could barely make use of it with her minuscule amount of MP. </p><p>Nano Tech Engineering, in its essence, was the Nanomancer\'s core skill. It was the skill she would use if she wanted to create anything on the run. </p><p>Examples being armour, vehicles and even bunkers. The largest creation she had ever made in her lifetime was the flying fortress – Seraphim. </p><p>The flying fortress was one of the key factors in ending a battle that had raged across the continent. </p><p>Spanning over several tens of miles in diameter, she had an army help her make use of all the functions Seraphim came with. </p><p>Cannons, Rail Guns, Drones, Acceleration, Barriers etc. </p><p>Raining destruction onto the land below, her flying fortress turned the tides of war into a one sided slaughter. </p><p>Musing at the memory, Shiro shook her head as she stored the D rank weapon away. </p><p class=\"oreqqc\"></p><p>She then focused her gaze on the E ranked [Dual Ended Poison Blade]. </p><p>Her hands hovered over the handle as she dropped the Infuser. </p><p>Before the Infuser touched the handle, it started to shift as compartments opened up and latched itself onto the handle. </p><p>Shiro could see metal tendrils slowly eat away at the materials as it spread outwards onto the blade. </p><p>From the centre of the Infuser, a fan could be heard spinning as Shiro recognised the sound to be the Infuser mixing its mana with the weapon. </p><p>A neon blue like pulse travelled along the tendrils as it slowly covered the entire weapon. </p><p>It took a while to complete the fusion, but the Infuser had succeeded in converting the weapon into a growth type weapon. </p><p>The organic handle was now decorated with mechanical detail lined with neon blue.

Any benefit they can provide, I can get with a bit of hard work.

The reason as to why it was called a raiding party was due to the fact that the members involved would be more than 50. </p><p>This party of 50 adventurers would challenge the large scale Dungeons with huge bosses that can\'t be taken down by an average party of 5 to 10. </p><p>In each of the floors of these large scale Dungeons, they would have a floor guardian rather than an obelisk guardian. The floor guardians were much more powerful than obelisk guardians as they were guaranteed to have a [General Class] title or higher. </p><p class=\"oreqqc\"></p><p>There were also raiding parties in the adventurer\'s guild, but the mortality rate was much larger as most of them would be strangers to each other and not coordinate well. </p><p>These large scale Dungeons were dangerous but the rewards were just as enticing. For normal Dungeons, the party leader would be the one to collect and distribute the equipment. </p><p>But for the large scale Dungeons, the rewards are distributed in terms of contribution. Everyone is guaranteed a drop as the party leader has no control over this. The system calculates and distributes. </p><p>\"Since Shiro\'s not joining a Faction I won\'t either.\" Lyrica said. </p><p>[Don\'t be stupid. I chose not to because I am confident that I can join a public raid and not die.] Shiro wrote down. </p><p>\"But-\" </p><p>Lyrica was about to reply but stopped seeing Shiro\'s glare. </p><p>[Unless I see you clear a level 20 Dungeon by yourself, I won\'t let you be so reckless.] Shiro wrote down as Lyrica nodded slowly. </p><p>[With a faction raid, there will be plenty of healers to help you. With public ones, healers aren\'t a guarantee. And even if they are, they may focus on healing one person instead.] </p><p class=\"oreqqc\"></p><p>Lyrica nodded at the harsh truth. </p><p>[Chin up though, we\'ll be challenging a Dungeon tomorrow.] Shiro gave Lyrica\'s shoulder a pat before walking out of the room. </p><p>Lyrica sat in the same spot as she clenched her fists. She was frustrated that she couldn\'t prove Shiro wrong either. </p><p>\'I need to prove that I can solo a Dungeon even without her help!\' Lyrica thought feeling spurred on to prove Shiro that she has the potential to survive an E ranked raid if they did go to one. </p><p>Shiro, who was observing her through the crack of the door, smiled seeing her plan work. It was a make it or break it situation that would be extremely helpful for Lyrica\'s mentality. </p><p>If she rises to the challenge, then that means her low self esteem is almost fixed. When it does, what remains will be a reliable teammate. </p><p>As they say, a foolish teammate is worse than a strong enemy. </p><p>\'Now I just need to make sure I cultivate her confidence but not turn it into arrogance. I also need her to have a sense of situational awareness. Charging into a fight with an opponent much stronger than you is idiotic. And trying to rely on some miracle to happen and save you is ridiculous.\' Shiro thought as she smiled and walked away. </p><p>Returning to her room, Shiro changed out of her school uniform and into the dress she first woke up in. She didn\'t know what the dress was made from but she did know that it was indestructible. It didn\'t provide any benefits though. </p><p class=\"oreqqc\"></p><p>She left the school grounds as she opened her tablet to search for the lowest D ranked Dungeon. She wanted to have some time to level up by herself. </p><p>[Frag Ant\'s Burrow LVL 21 – Floors: 3] </p><p>Boss Level: LVL 25 </p><p>The location was just on the outskirts of the city as it would take roughly 30mins even with her AGI. </p><p>Shiro didn\'t mind though as she dashed towards the location. She froze the ground under her feet as she started to skate towards the location at a much faster pace. </p><p>Taking routes through the alleyways and rooftops, Shiro avoided most pedestrian\'s attention. </p><p>She didn\'t leave any traces of Ice behind her either as that would be troublesome if incidents happened because of this. </p><p>In just 20 minutes, Shiro arrived at the Dungeon location. </p><p>Hardly anyone was here as Shiro entered the Dungeon before they realised she entered alone. </p><p class=\"oreqqc\"></p><p>The Dungeon was similar to the Serpent\'s Dungeon. It was housed in an underground area with barely any lighting. </p><p>Giving her body a stretch, Shiro created a dagger as she could already see a few Frag Ant\'s climbing out of their burrows. </p><p>After reaching LVL 21, her daggers took a 1500MP to make a level 21 version.

The main weapon being the mandibles and the abdomen location on his rear. The abdomen would lay traps around the area when they fight. </p><p>These traps would act like landmines which exploded on impact. </p><p>Remembering what she read about the Bombard Frag Ant, Shiro understands that setting all of these mines off at the start would be the safest option. Especially since the explosions don\'t affect the Ant itself. </p><p>\'Exploding the mines would take too much on my MP since I\'ll have to cover quite an area.\' Shiro thought as she made a dagger in her hands. </p><p>Twirling the dagger between her fingers, Shiro grinned. </p><p>\'Therefore, the best option was to explode the newest mine it plants down and aggro it to my territory.\' Shiro thought as she threw the dagger towards the ceiling. </p><p>A pale blue light spread across the roof as Shiro smiled seeing her traps in place. </p><p>Flicker her wrist, she called the dagger back. </p><p class=\"oppddv\"></p><p>[MP: 120/2000] </p><p>Injecting more mana into the dagger, Shiro made a second dagger as she was ready to fight. </p><p>\'Now!\' Shiro thought seeing the Ant laid another mine. </p><p>Throwing the dagger towards the mine, Shiro had already started to dash backwards in case of a chain reaction from the mines. </p><p>*BOOM!!! </p><p>The mine caused 2 other mines to blow up as smoke obscured her vision. </p><p>She could hear the legs of the Ant skitter across the ground as she recalled her dagger. </p><p>*KRRRRRR!!!!! </p><p>Bursting through the smoke, the Ant charged towards Shiro with its four mandibles opened wide ready to crush her. </p><p class=\"oppddv\"></p><p>Twisting her body, Shiro threw both daggers at the opening before flipping backwards. </p><p>As expected, the Ant closed its mouth causing the daggers to bounce off. </p><p>Shiro grinned as she clutched her hand causing the daggers to explode into two pillars of Ice. The pillars of Ice was formed in front of the Ant which blocked its path. </p><p>The Ant stumbled at the sudden obstacle. </p><p>Seeing the Ant stop in its tracks, Shiro activated the traps she set earlier. </p><p>*KSH KSH KSH KSH KSH KSH!!! </p><p>Several Ice spikes shot down from the ceiling as it formed a cage around the Ant.

Using her Snow Magic, the tunnels became a winter wonderland of ice and snow. </p><p>The Ant raged as it wanted to try keep itself active but despaired feeling its own movements become sluggish. </p><p>Due to the fact that its primary physiology resembles that of an ant, when the temperature decreases, the Bombard Frag Ant would enter a hibernation phase. </p><p>Giving Shiro one last glare, the ant collapsed under its own weight and entered deep hibernation. </p><p>\"Heheh~ One shouldn\'t always fight a hard battle.

Storing the stone away, she collected her loot. </p><p>To her disappointment, everything the Ant dropped were miscellaneous items and equipment that were worse than what she had on. </p><p>\"Can\'t you at least give me something I can use?\" Shiro muttered kicking at the spot where the Ant had died. </p><p>Recycling everything, she proceeded towards the obelisk. </p><p>However, something grabbed her attention as her hand paused just before touching the obelisk. </p><p>Walking behind the obelisk, Shiro crouched down and found a hole of sorts. The hole could probably fit a young a.d.u.l.t of a modest build as Shiro\'s interest was peaked. </p><p>Stepping back slightly, Shiro sat down and brought up her tablet. </p><p>Searching the information she downloaded for the Frag Ant\'s burrow, she saw that a few people discovered this path but never reached the end. </p><p class=\"oppddv\"></p><p>Contemplating on whether or not she should enter, Shiro eventually decided to enter since the max level of this Dungeon was 25. </p><p>The Dungeon\'s adhere to a strict rule and unless the Dungeon\'s mutate, no monster\'s of higher level will be spawned. </p><p>Climbing into the hole without much difficulty, Shiro continued to traverse the hidden path. </p><p>As she went along, the path seemed to have started to shrink as an a.d.u.l.t would have difficulties entering. </p><p>Shiro didn\'t have any problems entering since her physiology was that of a young teen. The further she went, the narrower the paths became. Eventually, she had to crawl to proceed through the tunnel. </p><p>\'Maybe I should turn back…\' Shiro thought as this may just be a meaningless hole. </p><p>However, her instinct told her that there was definitely something to be gained at the end of this. </p><p>Some Dungeons had a feature where there would be hidden paths. Hidden paths were hard to traverse but gave bountiful rewards. </p><p>Shiro knew this path would be hard for any a.d.u.l.t to enter and would be impossible for any young teen to enter either. This was due to the fact that the a.d.u.l.t was too big and the teen would probably die before entering the tunnel. </p><p class=\"oppddv\"></p><p>A single Frag Ant would have the prowess to kill the teen even if he/she sought refuge in the tunnels. </p><p>Since her physical body had no correlation to her age, she had managed to fit both the criteria of strength and a small build. </p><p>Continuing her crawl through the hole, Shiro only felt her frown deepen as she had been crawling for a little too long now. </p><p>\'Work smart work hard. Since you want to test my patience, I\'ll show you what I can do.\' Shiro thought as her fingers pressed down on the walls of the hole. </p><p>\"Fuuuu…..\" She let out a breath of cold mist as the hole started to freeze. </p><p>Using the skill, Faded Snow Movement, Shiro increased her speed to the maximum and started to slide through the hole. </p><p>Her speed started to pick up as she continuously built up her momentum using the ice to give her a push. </p><p>After what seemed to be an hour of high speed sliding, Shiro felt the surroundings shift slightly as it was getting brighter. </p><p>Making two daggers, Shiro plunged them into the side of the walls to slow her down. </p><p class=\"oppddv\"></p><p>*CRRRR!!!!!!! </p><p>The sound of metal dragging across the rocks assaulted Shiro\'s ears causing her to flinch slightly. </p><p>However, she had achieved her desired effect since she slowed down to a complete stop. </p><p>Panting slightly from the amount of strength she exerted, Shiro made her way to the opening of the hole. </p><p>Climbing out, her eyes widened to see where she was at. </p><p>It was something akin to the inside of a cathedral except that it had no seats. An interior designed with a combination of quartz and gold. </p><p>Pillars etched with the carvings of holy animals and angles supported the ceilings. </p><p>On the ceilings, a heavenly scenery was painted with fine details in every corner. </p><p>On the floor, a symmetrical pattern was tiled as it swirled towards a single chest that laid in the middle of the room. </p><p class=\"oppddv\"></p><p>\'Why would something like this exist? Hardly anyone would be able to see this.\' Shiro thought with a frown. </p><p>\"[Location]\" </p><p>[Tomb of the Holy Dragon Emperor] </p><p>\"Tomb of the Holy Dragon Emperor?\" She muttered as she looked around and observed the room. </p><p>Her eye twinkled as she understood the situation. </p><p>Walking over to the pillars, Shiro placed her hand onto one of the carvings. </p><p>The material was cool to the touch even for someone like Shiro who is a Snow Girl. </p><p>Crouching down, Shiro tapped the symmetrical tiles with her knuckles. </p><p>\"Hmmm….\" Shiro narrowed her eyes as she looked around. </p><p class=\"oppddv\"></p><p>This was definitely not a Tomb of a Holy Dragon Emperor. A Tomb of a Holy Dragon Emperor wouldn\'t include any cold materials. Especially not one that was so cold to the touch even for her. </p><p>A real tomb of the Holy Dragon Emperor would be lukewarm to red hot due to the materials used to craft its tomb. Even without hot materials, it would refuse to be cold materials as a substitute. The Holy Dragon would rather go without a tomb. </p><p>\'Since this isn\'t the real Holy Dragon Emperor\'s Tomb, what is it.\' Shiro thought to herself. </p><p>The only thing left around was the chest which was situated in the middle of the room. </p><p>Narrowing her eyes, Shiro crouched down and placed both palms to the ground. </p><p>\'Freeze!\' </p><p>Ice spread out from her hands as it shot towards the chest. </p><p>Sensing danger, the chest opened up with arms extending out from the inside. Pushing against the pedestal, the chest dodged the ice. </p><p>[Den of the Trickster] </p><p class=\"oppddv\"></p><p>\'I knew it.\' Shiro thought, seeing the updated location. The previous cathedral disappeared as the surroundings were illuminated but a blue glow. Crystals hung from the cave ceiling as the tip of the crystal was the source of the blue glow. </p><p>Scattered around the ground were several dried up husks of ants and human skeletons. The weirdest thing was why human skeletons remained here even after the Dungeon wipe. </p><p>\'The adventurer\'s probably died to the trickster.\' Shiro thought as this would most likely be why no one had recorded this on the net. </p><p>[The Trickster LVL 25 – (Elite)] </p><p>The Trickster was the next step up from a Mimic, but it still looked like a normal adorned chest. </p><p>However, when opened, two sickly thin arms would crawl out from inside. The inside of the chest resembled the mouth of a worm. With row upon rows of teeth, saliva could be seen dripping constantly. Four disgusting tongues could be seen as the tongues themselves seem like they were constructed with a multitude of tongues due to the grooves. </p><p>Thankfully she realised sooner that this was a trap. Or else, the moment the Trickster grabbed hold of her, she wouldn\'t be able to escape its grasp. Naturally, she could then just freeze it. </p><p>However, higher level Tricksters were known to cancel out your skills when in close proximity of their mouth so Shiro would rather not risk that unless she was backed into a corner. </p><p>Flicking her fingers upwards, several Ice pillars shot up from around the Trickster as scaffolds started to construct themselves. </p><p class=\"oppddv\"></p><p>The Trickster trembled slightly before it erupted into a mass of flesh. </p><p>With the chest as the source, a giant mutilated worm-like being could be seen extending out of it. 6 unnaturally long arms with 5 joints thrashed around as it destroyed the Ice. It\'s body had no skin as it was just muscle and teeth. It measured to around 4.5 meters in length and had a diameter of 2 meters. </p><p>\'This one already knows the skill flesh puppet?\' Shiro thought with a frown. </p><p>Flesh Puppet was a rare skill that a very select few of the Tricksters were known to have. At the cost of its HP, a fleshy puppet was summoned to help it battle. The longer the flesh puppet was activated, the more HP was drained. </p><p>\"You\'re only just a huge target.\" Shiro said as her pupils glowed a menacing blue. </p><p>A blizzard started to form as Ice spread out with her being the centre. The snow fall increased as it eventually encompassed the entire room. </p><p>With the snow blocking the sight, the overall temperature hid Shiro from the Trickster\'s senses. </p><p>*IRRRREEEEE!! </p><p>The flesh puppet screamed out as one of its arms was pierced by a dagger. </p><div class=\"adsbox\"></div><p class=\"oppddv\"></p><p>Turning the head towards the dagger, the teeth on his body twitched as it sensed danger. </p><p>*BOOM! </p><p>The dagger exploded into a mass of ice causing the Trickster to stumble from the force and use its arms to stabilise itself. </p><p>Two floating blue lights tracked it down as another dagger hit the face and exploded. </p><p>*KSHHHH!!! </p><p>The Trickster was enraged as the flesh puppet shrank its body down before expanding out with teeth extending for several meters. </p><p>Shiro frowned seeing this as two of the teeth that extended outwards had almost hit her. If not for Faded Snow Movement that turned a portion of her body to snow and mist, it would have pierced her left shoulder and right thigh. </p><p>Moving towards the Trickster, Shiro narrowed her eyes as she dodged the teeth strikes. </p><p>Mana started to gather at her palms as the sheer amount of mana she was gathering became visible to the eye. </p><p>\'Focus and explode.\' Shiro thought as she was within touching distance of the flesh puppet. </p><p>*BOOOMMM!!!!! </p><p>A giant explosion of ice fanned out as it cut the flesh puppet in two before freezing the bisected part of the puppet. </p><p>The chest shivered seeing the puppet die as Shiro didn\'t give it the chance to escape. </p><p>Her two eyes glowed menacingly above the chest while she summoned a Ice spear and pierced the chest. </p><p>Twisting the spear, the tip enlarged like a blowfish as a multitude of ice spikes penetrated and destroyed the Trickster. </p>'),(225,10,'Chapter 16 Hundred Blade Frag Ant',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Landing softly, Shiro breath out a wave of cold mist as the snowfall lightened up before stopping completely. </p><p>[MP: 3400/9300] </p><p>Her MP usage wasn\'t too extreme as the main catalyst for the blizzard was her passive Cold Aura. </p><p>As a seasoned veteran in combat, she could control the amount of bloodl.u.s.t she exhibited. By pushing the limit of her bloodthirst, she could actively freeze her surroundings without using MP and instead, make it more efficient to use her Ice magic. </p><p>Kicking the fragments of the chest away, Shiro was disappointed that there were no mana stone to harvest. </p><p>\"[Collect]\" </p><p>\"Oh my, well isn\'t this something...\" Shiro muttered seeing the loot. </p><p>It wasn\'t that the loot was bountiful.

Barely. </p><p>Looking around as she now had the time to inspect her surroundings in much greater detail, Shiro saw that there was another room connected to the room she was in. </p><p>Walking through the crack in the walls to reach the room, she saw the location update once more. </p><p>[Trickster\'s Abode] </p><p>\"Trickster\'s Abode? The thing had a house?!\" Shiro muttered. </p><p class=\"pkzyoy\"></p><p>Walking through the cave walls, she eventually found the abode as she was surprised at what she saw. </p><p>A clear stream circled a small island in the centre of the cave. From the island, a simple wooden bridge was present to connect the tunnel and the island together. </p><p>A single lone cabin stood atop the island as it gave Shiro a feeling of loneliness. </p><p>Illuminated by glowing stalactites, the scenery almost looked mystic. </p><p>Walking over, Shiro came up to the door of the cabin. </p><p>\'The cabin seems to have been here for a long time…\' Shiro thought seeing all of the dust that had gathered over time. </p><p>Opening the door, Shiro coughed slightly from all the dust. </p><p>The interior was simple. A bookshelf and a rocking chair. Besides the rocking chair, was a small table. </p><p>A decorated book laid on top of the table as it seemed like a grimoire of sorts.

She was somewhat expecting a skill but not a talent. The difference between a talent and a skill was the talent being more natural, more powerful and more efficient. </p><p>It requires less MP and it gives you a title.

If she stayed still, the blades would have hit her head and legs. </p><p>Reaching out to touch the flat sides of the blades, Shiro froze the Ants just before she landed once more. </p><p>In that short exchange, Shiro had managed to freeze 5 Ants. </p><p class=\"pkzyoy\"></p><p>\"Damn, you guys are relentless.\" Shiro commented as she shattered the ice and killed all 5 ants. </p><p>\"And then I\'m left with the rest of you.\" Shiro said, turning around to an army of floating eyes crawling towards her. </p><p>[Bladed Frag Ant Drone LVL 24] </p><p>[Bladed Frag Ant Drone LVL 23] </p><p>[Bladed Frag Ant Drone LVL 25] </p><p>… </p><p>Cracking her neck slightly, Shiro made an Ice spear as she crouched down. </p><p>\"Fuuu….\" Breathing out slightly, the temperature around her began to drop. </p><p>Digging her feet into the ground, Shiro sprinted towards the army of ants. </p><p class=\"pkzyoy\"></p><p>*KRRRRR! </p><p>The ants cried on in return as started to skitter towards her. </p><p>Stepping down as hard as she could, Shiro build up for force and momentum as she threw the spear as hard as she could. </p><p>Flicking her fingers, the spear broke apart mid-air. </p><p>\"Break!\" Shiro shouted as each of the pieces exploded into pillars that crushed several ants. </p><p>The ants became enraged as Shiro only grinned. </p><p>Sliding across the ground, she erected two ice blocks and sent them forward. </p><p>*BOOM BOOM </p><p>Ants could be seen flying through the air from the force of the collision. </p><p class=\"pkzyoy\"></p><p>\'Not enough, faster, more efficient, more ruthless.\' Shiro thought in her mind as she still wasn\'t fighting to her full capacity. </p><p>The shorter arm reach, the weaker muscles, the height and the stamina.

But you\'re not going to overwhelm me that easily.\" Shiro grinned seeing the destruction that laid before her. </p><p class=\"pkzyoy\"></p><p>Clutching her fists, all of the ice shattered killing a majority of the ants.

They were, in essence, cannon fodder. Without a giant army to swarm the person, they were easy to kill. </p><p class=\"pkzyoy\"></p><p>Naturally, this was what Shiro thinks. Most parties needed at least a healer to help them kill a [Bladed Frag Ant Drone]. This was attributed to the fact that their instincts and body control paled in comparison to Shiro. </p><p>Ignoring the fact that her strength was limited, her control and instincts were the finest even amongst veterans of combat. </p><p>Funnily enough, the closer she went towards the obelisk, the fewer times she got ambushed. </p><p>It was weird since the Dungeon ecosystem was mostly correct 9 times out of 10. For an anomaly like this to happen must mean the obelisk guardian is that of a foreign species or that it cannibalises which inflicts fear towards the drone. </p><p>From what she read about this Dungeon; The obelisk guardian was a boss called [Hundred Blade Frag Ant]. Since it\'s the same species it the most likely situation was cannibalism. </p><p>*Crrrrrrrrr…. </p><p>The scraping of the blades against the ground could be heard faintly as Shiro knew she was getting close. </p><p>Stepping forward slowly, she observed the [Hundred Blade Frag Ant] </p><p>[Hundred Blade Frag Ant LVL 25 – Elite] </p><p>HP:80,000/80,000 </p><p>MP: 20,000/20,000 </p><p>As its name suggested, it looked as if it had a hundred blades acting as legs.

It\'s a god damn giant millipede!!!\' Shiro thought cursing at the misleading name of the monster. </p><p>\'No wonder the ants weren\'t as common closer to the obelisk. There\'s another species guarding it that\'s why!\' </p><p>Millipedes were different to centipedes. While some may get the two mixed up, there are a few distinct differences. </p><p>First off, the Millipede have very short antennae compared to the Centipede. The physiology of a centipede is flatter compared to a Millipede which supported a more rounded chitin armour. </p><p>The centipede\'s legs are positioned outwards like a razor blade while the millipede\'s legs are tucked under its body. </p><p>In addition to this, the centipede was limited to a single pair of legs per segment of its body. </p><p>This is where this huge Millipede earned the name Hundred Blades. Unlike a centipede, the millipede has two pairs of legs per segment. Not only this, each segment is relatively smaller than the centipede\'s segments. </p><p>With each of the legs being composed of a razor sharp blade, Shiro shivered slightly just thinking about getting caught in those legs. Even with her MP and attack, the millipede would just wear her down in a battle of attrition. </p><p>\'Millipede millipede… They are scavengers that are classed as herbivores. Yet obviously, this one wants to chew on meat.\' Shiro thought seeing the \'Ant\' move around. </p><p>\'Since I can\'t base it on the normal standards, I\'ll learn as I fight.\' She concluded. </p><p class=\"xrjkco\"></p><p>Preparing herself so that her concentration was at its best. Shiro created two daggers for now. </p><p>When testing the capabilities of an enemy, one must be between the fine line of the danger zone and the safety zone. </p><p>Too far into the danger zone without sufficient understanding can be highly fatal. Yet, staying in the safety zone will restrain the knowledge you receive. Therefore, one must dance around these two zones carefully to get the maximum benefit. </p><p>\'First, concussive shock. Test the reaction when robbed of its sensory.\' Shiro thought as she dashed towards the millipede. </p><p>Twirling the blade by the handle, she threw it towards the short antennas. The speed was decreased dramatically as most of the force was focused on making it spin through the air. </p><p>The millipede raised its head as the daggers bounced on both antennas. </p><p>*CRR! </p><p>Freezing the antennas, Shiro jumped backwards immediately seeing the desired effect. </p><p>Without hesitation, the millipede rolled into a ball. </p><p class=\"xrjkco\"></p><p>\'Is that all?\' Shiro thought with a frown. </p><p>*KISHIN! </p><p>The millipede\'s blade-like legs protruded from the side of its body while the shell spiked up abnormally like a porcupine\'s quills. </p><p>She wasn\'t sure how the millipede was generating the forces for it to spin on the spot, but she knew it was preparing to go on a rampage. </p><p>Pushing her palms outwards, a ramp was created with scaffolds to support the structure. </p><p>*KRKRKRKRKRKR </p><p>The sound of blades cutting through rock could be heard as she knew it was rolling around to try hit everything due to a loss of its sensory. </p><p>\'Robbing the millipede of the senses will increase fight difficulty.

Fighting head on is not advised.\' </p><p>Remaining calm, Shiro retracted all of the Ice as she waited for the millipede to unfurl itself. </p><p>It was only after 10 minutes of rampaging did it unroll itself. </p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she peered past the tens of blade legs it had under its body. </p><p>\'With the blades being mostly concentrated on its underbelly, it may be a natural defence due to its weakness.\' </p><p>Raising up her arms, Shiro gritted her teeth slightly as ice started to form under the millipede. </p><p>*CCRRRR!!! </p><p class=\"xrjkco\"></p><p>The ice raised the millipede into air little by little as it tried to claw away at the ice. </p><p>Flexing her fingers, Shiro froze the bladed legs in their place </p><p>Making a sharp ice spear, she took aim and threw the spear. </p><p>*TSSSSS!!!! </p><p>Chemicals sprayed out from under the millipede as Shiro watched all the ice melt visibly. </p><p>\'It has ridiculous armour, bladed feet and chemicals…unless you try to overpower it, you won\'t kill it in anytime soon. And if I try to fight it in a battle of attrition, it\'s not worth the effort.\' </p><p>\"However… I want to see just how I will pry your shell open.\" Shiro grinned. </p><p>Electricity sparked in her hand as she started to use her new skill. Sword Creation. </p><p>Running towards the millipede before the swords even finish being crafted, Shiro stepped down hard as a pillar of ice extended out and pierced towards its legs. </p><p class=\"xrjkco\"></p><p>Four of the millipede\'s legs reacted as it cut the pillar into small sections that did it no harm. </p><p>\"Surprise~\" Shiro appeared near the legs as they couldn\'t retract in time. </p><p>The sword formed fully in her hands as she twisted her body and cut the legs. </p><p>*KREEEE!!! </p><p>The millipede screamed feeling 6 of its legs cut off in one go. </p><p>\"Aiya~ Just as sharp as I remembered.\" Shiro grinned. </p><p>The sword was a metallic black in colour, mechanical details could be seen around the guard and the hilt. It was a simple looking sword but its sharpness was something to be feared. </p><p>[Nano Craft Sword LVL 24 (Blue)] </p><p>+30 Sharpness </p><p class=\"xrjkco\"></p><p>+25 Bleed </p><p>+10 Critical Rate </p><p>+5 Critical Damage </p><p>+30 Severing </p><p>Skill: Razor Edge </p><p>Use 400MP to gain +20% cutting strength for the next attack. </p><p>MP – 3600/4000 </p><p>Quickly kicking her legs so that she flipped backwards, Shiro avoided the chemicals the millipede spat at her. </p><p>Mid flip, she sliced towards the chitin and left a slight groove. </p><p class=\"xrjkco\"></p><p>\'Hmm, seems like the best way is for me to attack the bottom.\' Shiro thought, preparing herself. </p><p>Landing softly, she slammed her hands down and created a wall of ice just under the millipede raising it up into the air. </p><p>Once again, the millipede tried to use its chemicals but Shiro was way ahead of it. </p><p>Clutching her fist, the ice pillars lifting the millipede up exploded into a myriad of spikes penetrating its weak lower body. </p><p>Chemicals went everywhere as Shiro had to shift her location several times to avoid getting dowsed in corrosive liquid. </p><p>Dragging the sword on the ground, Shiro dashed towards the underbelly. </p><p>*KRRRRR!!! </p><p>The sword ripped through the soft armour with barely any resistance. </p><p>Using Faded Snow Movement, Shiro quickly avoided some of the bladed feet trying to kill her. </p><p class=\"xrjkco\"></p><p>Twisting her body, she escaped from under the millipede. </p><p>[HP: 43,000/80,000] </p><p>Her attacks proved to be extremely effective as the health was dropping rapidly. </p><p>Sensing its doom, the millipede wanted to take her down with it. </p><p>Curling into a ball, the millipede\'s chitin spiked up as Shiro narrowed her eyes. </p><p>\"Oh you M*******!!!\" She cursed seeing the abnormal mana density. </p><p>Running would prove foolish as her defences are too weak to survive the self-destruction of a level 25 boss. </p><p>Shiro quickly dissembled her sword to regain her mana and used [Harden]. </p><p>[Harden] </p><p class=\"xrjkco\"></p><p>Harden\'s your skin for increased defence. </p><p>+35 DEF and -20% damage taken -20% AGI </p><p>Duration: 30 seconds. </p><p>Cooldown: 2 minutes. </p><p>A silver metallic sheen seems to cover her body as she placed her palm on the ground and used the remainder of her MP to create a giant wall of ice. </p><p>*BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!! </p><p>Layers upon layers of Ice walls shot up in front of Shiro as she quickly braced for impact. </p><p>*BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p><p>It felt like the entire Dungeon shook as Shiro was blasted backwards from the explosion. Even when her ice walls absorbed most of the impact, the force hitting her body still launched her backwards. </p><p class=\"xrjkco\"></p><p>Rolling on the ground a few times, she made sure to use her arms to protect her head. </p><p>When she finally stopped rolling, Shiro quickly put her guard up in case any blade ants wanted to ambush her. </p><p>\"Fuuu…..\" She sighed out seeing that there was no danger and checked her HP and MP. </p><p>[HP: 950/7300] </p><p>[MP: 80/11,300] </p><p>This was the first time her HP and MP have dropped so low in terms of the overall percentage. </p><p>Stumbling on her feet, Shiro limped towards the obelisk. </p><p>What used to be the space for a boss fight was now covered in corrosive chemicals, flesh, blades and armour. </p><p>Looking around, Shiro was sure the walls per pushed back by quite a remarkable amount as the explosion must have taken some of the cave walls with it. </p><p class=\"xrjkco\"></p><p>It was a known fact that Dungeon walls are one of and if not THE strongest material known ever. The material scaled up in level as the higher level the Dungeon, the sturdier walls. </p><p>For the boss to be able to shave off quite a few layers of the wall, shows just how absurd that explosion was. </p><p>\"[Collect]\" She collected her look straight away as she knew there won\'t be a mana stone. </p><p>When the monster self-destructs, the mana stone was used as the source and gathering point. </p><p>Therefore, there won\'t even be a shard of the mana stone left. </p><p>The loot she got wasn\'t too bad but she had no use for any of them. </p><p>Recycling everything, Shiro sat down by a rock that wasn\'t coated in corrosive liquid. </p><p>Whilst waiting for her HP and MP to regen, she decided to have a look at her current food stock. </p><p>[E Rank Mana Stone x84] </p><p class=\"xrjkco\"></p><p>[D Rank Mana Sone x40] </p><p>\"40 D rank mana stones should last me a while.\" Shiro muttered as she laid on her back and threw an E rank mana stone for her mouth to eat. </p><p>It took her quite a while to regenerate everything as she wondered if she should stock up on some health and mana potions. </p><p>\'It would probably for the best if I stocked up. At least then I can regenerate my health and mana quickly.\' Shiro thought. </p><p>However, as handy as health and mana potions can get, they also have their own backlashes. Mainly due to the skill of the creator who made the potion. </p><p>Examples being low tier health and mana potions having adverse effects later along in the line. </p><p>These effects can be a decrease of total HP, slow MP recovery and so on. Only the higher quality health and mana potions provided barely any adverse effects. </p><p>\'I think I\'ll stick to my Passive Regeneration for now.\' Shiro concluded. There was another skill she would like to get, it was the top tier regeneration skill of monsters called [Cell Rebirth]. </p><p>It was a skill that is both passive and active as the monster can use its own MP and exchange it for health. The known limits of this skill were the power to regrow anything that doesn\'t destroy over 80 to 90% of your body. </p><p class=\"xrjkco\"></p><p>Just remembering the sight of a level 100+ monster regenerating all of its lost HP made Shiro curse at the perverted skill. </p><p>With that being said, she wanted the skill as well since it would increase her survivability by a large amount. Not only that, she was currently a monster so there may be a chance for that in the future. </p><p>Giving her body a stretch, she opened the obelisk and tapped the final floor. The boss floor. </p><p>The room was oddly shaped as it had an open sky that was sprinkled with stars. The surroundings seemed to be the ruins of an open Colosseum as Shiro spotted the boss. </p><p>The boss had an armoured body like the rest of the ants but there was one HUGE difference. </p><p>[Flying Frag Ant Queen LVL 25 – Boss] </p><p>HP: 150,000/150,000 </p><p>MP: 200,000/200,000 </p><p>The boss hovered in the air was the transparent wings flapped at incredible speeds. </p><p class=\"xrjkco\"></p><p>\"…\" Shiro stared at the boss with a bland expression. </p><p>Flicking her finger, a huge ice spike shot up as the queen wanted to evade. </p><p>Suddenly, the tip of the spike opened up like a flower as the smaller spikes pierced the wings, suspending the queen in mid-air. </p><p>\"When you expose such weak wings and stay in the same spot, you\'re asking to be killed.\" Shiro said without a smile.

What she had unlocked right now was Nano Tech Engineering Tier 1. Both the Mana Extractor and the Transfer Vent were something she should have made when she was Tier 3. </p><p>The cost was low, but the physical burden was huge. </p><p>Blood started to drip from her hands as the nano bots continued to be produced trying to form the device. </p><p>When the device was finished, there was a pool of blood dripping from her fingers as Shiro had to endure the pain. </p><p>Her HP was also dropping little by little as she tried to create something out of her league. </p><p>Naturally, the queen wasn\'t letting Shiro stay on her back. But no matter how she tried to shake Shiro off, she kept an iron grip stopping herself from falling. </p><p class=\"qcoska\"></p><p>[Crappy Mana Extractor Prototype] </p><p>-93% efficiency </p><p>\'I know it\'s crap but did you have to title it Crappy Mana Extractor?\' </p><p>Activating the Crappy Mana Extractor, Shiro let a minuscule amount of MP enter her as the wings of the queen shimmered. The amount of mana that was being absorbed compared to the amount being transferred to her was very inefficient. </p><p>However, the main goal of the Mana Extractor was to drain the Mana from the queen. </p><p>[MP: 0/300,000] </p><p>When the MP was completely drained, the queen plummeted towards the ground as Shiro kicked off the back and landed on her feet. </p><p>She flinched when she felt the pain emanating from her right arm. </p><p>[Nano Tech Corrosion – Right Arm – 9 days 23h] </p><p class=\"qcoska\"></p><p>\'Figures…\' Shiro thought as this was to be expected.

In the time she recovered from the pain, the queen recovered as well. </p><p>\'Such a waste…\' Shiro thought as she could have dealt the queen so much damage. </p><p>Since her right hand was busted right now, Shiro opted to reduce the queen\'s health with bombs and long ranged attacks. </p><p>Making a dagger in her left hand, Shiro braced herself. </p><p>Dashing towards her, the queen opened all four bladed arms and cut towards Shiro. </p><p>An ice pillar erupted under her as Shiro dodged the strike. </p><p>She gritted her teeth as she endured the pain from her arm. </p><p>Stabbing her dagger into the ice pillar, she twisted it and a myriad of ice spikes shot out from the pillar. </p><p class=\"qcoska\"></p><p>Due to the close proximity of the queen and the pillar, she wasn\'t able to block it and was struck several times. </p><p>Letting go of the dagger, Shiro controlled the ice to make a gap and launched the dagger into the queen\'s face. </p><p>*BOOMMM!!!!! </p><p>The dagger exploded into a cl.u.s.ter of sharps dealing more damage to the queen. </p><p>Enraged, the queen twisted her body and became a cyclone of relentless blades. </p><p>Shiro hopped off the pillar lightly as she made a ramp to cushion her fall. </p><p>Flicking her finger upwards, a spear shot up from below the queen\'s legs and stabbed into her torso. </p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn\'t able to pierce her torso causing Shiro to frown. </p><p>Making sure she kept her distance, she whittled the queen\'s health little by little. </p><p class=\"qcoska\"></p><p>[Flying Frag Ant Queen] </p><p>HP: 1/200,000 </p><p>MP: 0/300,000 </p><p>Here was the biggest problem.

I\'m no longer the SSS class Nanomancer. I\'m just a D class Snow Girl right now.\' Shiro thought with a shake of her head. </p><p>Walking over to the obelisk that appeared in the centre of the room, Shiro teleported to the Teleport Shrine. </p><p>The time was 11:15pm and she had plenty of time before she would go to bed. </p><p>Pulling up her phone, Shiro decided to search up the technology in the current world. It was kind of hard as she could only use her left hand while the right arm was encased in ice to support it. </p><p>\'Hmm…Huge Rail Guns, Cold Weapons, Fire Arms, Nukes… seems pretty basic.\' Shiro thought, frowning at the choices she could see. </p><p>Naturally, she had no access to military information. But it wasn\'t hard to guess the technology from looking at what\'s available to the public. </p><p>With the knowledge she had from her past life, Shiro guessed she could probably propel the current technology by more than 10 years. </p><p>In her arsenal, she had a multitude of her \'lovelies\' to be shown to the world. </p><p>Advanced coil guns, portable electromagnetic guns, Nano Tech armour, magnetic repulsion systems and much more. Her mind was like a trove of technology the current world would kill to obtain. </p><p class=\"jmltep\"></p><p>And naturally, she also knew how to turn someone else into a Nanomancer. </p><p>While she was browsing through the technology, she stopped seeing an interesting image. </p><p>The image was that of a giant mechanised armour. It was crimson red with neon orange segments. Weapons on both hands and \'wings\' on the back. </p><p>\'Hmm, the back seems to be composed of several mana propulsion systems which give it flight. The parts connecting the mech like muscle might be crystallised mana fibres. The joins are controlled by a piston system and the mech seems to be highly flexible…\' Shiro thought, looking for some similar concepts. </p><p>\'I can probably recreate this. While the world may be lacking in the technology to flesh out concepts, I most certainly can. </p><p>The energy used to power the system would be the natural mana conversion generator. </p><p>The skeleton of the mech can be reinforced nano tech rods, these rods are many times heavier than desired but the durability makes up for that. </p><p>The muscles can be composed of light nano tech fibres twined with crystallised mana fibre. This would give it the flexibility and the durability it needs. </p><p>The armour can just be the light nano tech plating and finally, the control system will be the nerve sensory system.\' She thought mapping out a blueprint of the mech in her mind. </p><p class=\"jmltep\"></p><p>The nerve sensory system is a device that connects to your neck. It is situated on the nape as it would detect what the user wants to do through the synaptic cleft and transfer it as an action to the mech. One would normally use this when combined with floating mana blades but Shiro thinks this fits a giant robot better. </p><p>As a giant robot, there will always be an innate delay from the console to the extremities of the mech. With the nerve sensory system, she can shrink this delay down many times so make the mech more efficient. </p><p>Though that being said, making the mech is another matter in and of itself. </p><p>She has two options for making the mech. </p><p>A: Assembly through small premade parts. </p><p>B: Total assembly. </p><p>As the names suggested, the first part is making the mech through several premade parts. The main problem with this is the storage she would need as well as the time needed to assemble the mech. </p><p>As for B, she would need a ludicrous amount of mana to create and assemble everything at once. </p><p>The benefits would be that she can create the mech anytime she wants, but her concentration but be stable. This is due to the fact that she needs to envision the entire blueprint and not make a single mistake. A small mistake could lead to the entire mech collapsing on itself making it a waste of mana. </p><p class=\"jmltep\"></p><p>However, baby steps first. Thinking about mechs at this stage was nothing but a pipe dream. She could barely sustain her expenditure when using a nano craft sword never mind a giant hundred-meter mech. </p><p>However, from what she could guess, her next unlocks for the Nanomancer class are; </p><p>Bow Creation, Heavy Weapon Creation, Defence Creation, Armour Creation and Firearm Creation. </p><p>As for what\'s after Firearm Creation, it was the more technologically advanced weapons such as the Rail Gun. </p><p>\'If I guess correctly, then I\'ll probably unlock the Bow Creation around the 30,000 MP mark. The bow needs me to create the Nano Tech Fibres so the expenditure will be huge.\' Shiro thought. </p><p>However, the Nano Tech Fibres allow for her to output much more medium ranged potential as the penetrative capabilities of a bow was unmatched until she unlocks Firearm Creation. </p><p>Breathing out some cold mist, Shiro tilted her head back. </p><p>\"I have my work cut out for me…\" She muttered with a small smile. Progressing through the levels and unlocking everything slowly excited her. </p><p>When she was experimented on to become a Nanomancer, her level was over 200 without her being able to experience levelling up a level by level. She just shot to level 200 straight away when the experiment finished. </p><p class=\"jmltep\"></p><p>Now that she can experience the growth process she missed out on, the feeling was enjoyable.

But we still need to focus for formalities.\" Lyrica smiled. </p><p>[I want to melt… It\'s hot and boring.] Shiro sighed as she laid her body flat on the desk. She did so in a way that her right arm wouldn\'t hurt as much. </p><p>In addition to her boredom, the day was quite hot as Shiro felt stuffy just being in a room. </p><p>\"Hahaha, so you can\'t deal with the heat?\" Lyrica giggled slightly. </p><p>[No I can\'t. I hate the sun.] </p><p>\"But your passive is really helpful isn\'t it?\" Lyrica commented as she felt cooled down next to Shiro. </p><p>[Yeah yeah… just treat me like a walking air conditioning.] Shiro waved her left hand lazily. </p><p>\"Wow~ You really feel different when it gets hot.\" Lyrica muttered seeing the unreactive and \'whatever\' vibe Shiro was emitting. </p><p>[I\'m just not too good when it gets too hot. I\'ll be fine when it cools down or when the sun gets blocked.] She just wanted to curl up into a ball and retreat to the corner. </p><p class=\"dbksba\"></p><p>\"Shiro, for the spar do you just want to watch by the side?\" Lyrica asked as they had to go change for the sparring session. </p><p>Shiro didn\'t even type out a line as she pointed to her arm. </p><p>\"…\" \'Fine… Pretend I didn\'t ask.\' </p><p>[I can probably join if you want. I\'ll just be standing in the same spot using my ice though.] Shiro said as Lyrica shook her head. </p><p>\"Nope. You should just be good and recover for 10 days. Well 9 not including today.\" Lyrica said as they walked towards the changing rooms. </p><p>There was a mini test today as they had to try touch the teacher once. The main task wasn\'t to touch the teacher as it suggests, but rather what the students like to term. SURVIVE. </p><p>Shiro was quite interested in the mini test. Unfortunately, her arm didn\'t exactly agree with her sentiments. </p><p>Rather than fighting outside, they opted to be inside the sparring hall as it was a little too hot. Some students may suffer from a heat stroke. </p><p>The hall was huge as Shiro was sure it could fit 4 football fields in a 2 by 2 format. Surrounded by high walls and powerful lights which illuminated the area, this was by far one of the biggest buildings of this school. </p><p class=\"dbksba\"></p><p>Walking away from the group, Shiro sat down and watched the teacher split the teams up for sparring before grabbing a few students for the mini test. </p><p>Minding her own business, Shiro browsed the net for anything interesting. </p><p>Halfway through her search, she saw someone walking towards her and looked up. It was a boy a little taller than her. With average looks and a pair of glasses. In his hands was a bottle of water. </p><p>[Ted LVL 14 – Archer] </p><p>\"Erm… f-for you!\" He stuttered before putting the bottle down and ran away. </p><p>\'How cute.\' Shiro thought with a giggle. Seeing the boy work up the courage to give her a bottle of water made her smile a little. </p><p>During his run, he turned around slightly to check how Shiro reacted. </p><p>Shiro only smiled and gave him a light wave. This in turn caused him to blush a little and had a dumb smile plastered on his face. </p><p>Looking at the bottle, Shiro picked it up and inspected in. </p><p class=\"dbksba\"></p><p>[Water Bottle] </p><p>Just a water bottle, what else do you expect? Vodka? </p><p>\'This god damn description…\' Shiro thought with a sweat drop. </p><p>However, Ted\'s actions seemed to have sparked a chain reaction amongst the guys. They walked over and handed her items like towels and chairs. Shiro was getting swarmed by the mob as her annoyance slowly increased. </p><p>[Thanks, I\'m fine. I don\'t need all this.] Shiro typed out with a weary smile. </p><p>One of the boys looked at the foldable bed he carried behind him. He sighed slightly before muttering, \"Such a shame…\" </p><p>\'********!!! WHY DID YOU BRING A BED?!\' </p>');

I don\'t think you want to know.\" Lyrica shook her head. She didn\'t want Shiro to experience mental bullying from girls due to their jealousy. </p><p>[I kill monsters for a living. I don\'t think a lot of things can harm me.] Shiro typed out. She didn\'t know what was so bad about what they could be talking about. </p><p>Not to mention, Shiro was quite curious about what normal girls do around her age. Due to her unfortunate kidnapping after the village was raided, she never truly experienced what girls do her age. </p><p>\"I guess so? But it\'s still not very pleasant to be ostracised, so just don\'t pay them any attention.\" Lyrica said. </p><p>Seeing her constant refusal, Shiro could only nod her head. It didn\'t matter too much if she didn\'t know. She had Lyrica to spend her time with anyways. </p><p>The spars continued as it was Lyrica\'s turn to try \'survive\' against the teacher. </p><p>Since she couldn\'t use her actual weapon, Lyrica could only settle with a staff. Her movements were a little awkward but she could still put up a much better fight than when she just used a single long sword. </p><p>The teacher was dancing circles around Lyrica with a series of careful concise footsteps. However, this didn\'t affect Lyrica as her hidden proficiency displayed how powerful it was, with just a mere fraction of its power. </p><p>Sweeping clockwise with her foot, Lyrica created a little zone for herself as the teacher hopped backwards slightly. </p><p class=\"civsws\"></p><p>Smiling lightly, the teacher entered the zone with minimal care. However, that overconfidence bit her back quickly as the staff end entered her view quickly. </p><p>\'Ohya?~ Lyrica\'s already forming her attack domain using the hidden proficiency.\' Shiro thought impressed. </p><p>An attack domain was the stage before a full domain. It is a small concentrated area where the fighter would have pure concentration reaching 120%. Not many can break this attack domain without their own. </p><p>There are several forms to the attack domain which varies from weapon to weapon. Bow and arrows formed a doughnut shape attack domain. Anything around the mid-range area is the bow and arrow\'s home turf. </p><p>Staffs have an hourglass type of attack domain. The ends of the staff contain the most amount of power, yet the centre lacks diversity. </p><p>The sword and great sword have very similar attack domains as it is shaped like a semi-circle. It is harder to attack properly when the swordsman tried to strike behind him. But the frontal power held much diversity with an all-rounder type attack domain. </p><p>Axes and maces had a much narrower attack domain but their power compensates. With fast-moving rotations, the axe and maces are the powerhouses. </p><p>There are more, but the dagger\'s attack domain is one of Shiro\'s favourites. It didn\'t have the power of the sword nor the range of a bow. However, the piercing and the undisputed close combat prowess along with the diversity made it an attack domain that needed to be feared. </p><p>For Lyrica to almost construct her attack domain without even using the staff for long, truly shows the prowess of the hidden proficiencies. Not even Shiro, who used to have full body control, could form her attack domain with her weapon yet. </p><p class=\"civsws\"></p><p>One may call it unfair for Lyrica to gain the attack domain without hard work, but the hidden proficiency was an inborn gift. A natural talent is apart of one\'s fighting prowess and luck played a big part in life whether one denied it or not. </p><p>Tilting her head to quickly dodge the staff strike, the teacher grabbed towards the staff. </p><p>Lyrica allowed the teacher to grab as she used the force to propel herself forward and sweep a kick towards her head. </p><p>The teacher flipped backwards dodging the kick. </p><p>It was a shame that Lyrica\'s stats were lacking or else she would put up a good fight against the teacher. </p><p>\"Is this still the same Lyrica? She\'s so good at fighting!\" </p><p>\"True true! Seems like it was her level holding her back.\" </p><p>\"So I\'m looking at her, and is it just me or is she really. Like REALLY, beautiful?\" </p><p>\"Now that you mention it, if you look closer. Isn\'t Lyrica really attractive when she\'s focused?\" </p><p class=\"civsws\"></p><p>\"How did we not notice earlier?\" </p><p>\"She was so quiet before and hardly joined in.\" </p><p>… </p><p>Shiro smiled hearing the compliments towards Lyrica. She knew Lyrica was a beauty that only had a slight problem with her lack of confidence before. Her small aura and behaviour made it hard for people to notice her beauty since she was always looking down. </p><p>However, at this moment, Lyrica was solely focused on the teacher as she wanted to defeat the teacher and prove her worth. </p><p>Her gaze was focused as her normally rounded eyes became sharp. There wasn\'t the casual smile she had but instead, was replaced by a serious frown. </p><p>Her expression gave people the feeling of heroism and bravery as she fearlessly charged towards the teacher. </p><p>Stabbing her staff towards the teacher, Lyrica transitioned into a vault and gave the teacher a roundhouse kick. </p><p>The teacher dodged but it didn\'t slow down Lyrica\'s assault at all. </p><p class=\"civsws\"></p><p>Following up on the momentum of her kick, she landed on her foot and swung the staff towards the teacher. </p><p>Her movements from her hidden proficiency was a combination of different martial art movements, the current form was similar to the Chinese Shaolin Monk Staff Arts. </p><p>Her spare hand was used to balance her body while she kept low on the ground, giving her a very stable foundation and a hard to topple balance. </p><p>\"A little staff martial arts? How fun.\" The teacher smiled as her eyes narrowed and she took her own form. </p><p>She dashed towards Lyrica, clearly wanting to initiate the fight rather than wait. </p><p>Once the teacher entered her attack domain, Lyrica stabbed the staff towards the teacher. </p><p>*DON! </p><p>Slamming her palm against the flat end of the staff, the teacher stomped backwards to transfer the force before grabbing the staff and hit it with her spare hand. </p><p>*SNAP! </p><p class=\"civsws\"></p><p>The staff snapped in half as Lyrica\'s demeanour shattered along with it. Without her hidden proficiency assisting her, Lyrica was just an inexperienced adventurer who was no match for the seasoned teacher. </p><p>Lyrica raised her hands in defeat as the teacher was able to wipe the floor with her. </p><p>\"Learn some hand to hand combat. You need to have a back up in case you lose your weapon.\" The teacher advised as Lyrica nodded and walked away. </p><p>Shiro patted the seat next to her as Lyrica sat down heavily. Passing Lyrica a bottle of water, Shiro watched her drink it all in one go. </p><p>\"Ahh~! Refreshing.\" Lyrica said feeling rejuvenated. </p><p>[Nice work Lyrica.] Shiro smiled. </p><p>\"Ah, it\'s a little frustrating though…\" Lyrica smiled sadly. </p><p>[Why?] </p><p>\"I wanted to win so bad. Even with this boost I still couldn\'t defeat her.\" </p><p class=\"civsws\"></p><p>[Don\'t compare yourself like that. You\'re trying to compare in the wrong territory.] </p><p>\"I know but you would have won against her.\" Lyrica sighed. </p><p>[No I won\'t.] </p><p>\"What do you mean?\" </p><p>[Her status, experience and body control, are all factored in when she fights. You\'re trying to compare with a seasoned veteran with only a limited arsenal and power. That is how you become depressed.] Shiro shook her head. Being competitive is good, but there is a limit called the \'Achievable Target\'. </p><p>Above this target and one would be chasing an unreachable star, thus breaking their spirit more times than boosting it. One had to careful when choosing a target as it would encourage improvement. </p><p>\"But I thought you said the hidden proficiency was powerful…I still couldn\'t defeat her.\" Lyrica pouted. </p><p>[You know how many people would have wanted to strangle you for saying that?] Shiro chuckled slightly. </p><p>[The hidden proficiency is powerful but it is just a jump start. It\'s not omnipotent as one\'s hard work would hone the hidden proficiency further. And even those without a hidden proficiency can defeat the talented with enough hard work.] </p><p class=\"civsws\"></p><p>\"But aren\'t there ones you cannot surpass without talent? What about them?\" Lyrica asked. </p><p>[Are you untalented? Do you not have a hidden proficiency? Have you not grasped the boundaries of an Attack Domain at a young age?] Shiro asked rhetorically as Lyrica had no answer. </p><p>[Not many people have the benefit of receiving a hidden proficiency. Be grateful and work hard to further your talent.] </p><p>*Slap! </p><p>Lyrica slapped her cheeks shocking Shiro. </p><p>\"You\'re right. I can\'t be such a spoiled brat.\" Lyrica said with flushed up cheeks from the slaps. </p><p>\"....ow…\" </p><p>[Why did you have to hit that hard?] Shiro chuckled. </p><p>\"It was meant to be a wakeup call for me but it hurts more than I thought….\" Lyrica said with little droplets of tears forming. </p><p class=\"civsws\"></p><p>Shiro only chuckled before wiping the tears away with her fingers which caused Lyrica to blush slightly. </p><p>[After resting for a bit, you should keep trying to face the teacher to get experience.] Shiro suggested. </p><p>\"Ah er right…\" Lyrica stuttered as she jogged away to get a new weapon. </p><p>Shiro only shook her head. </p><p>\'Why does this girl get so fl.u.s.tered so much.\' She thought. </p><p>\"Hey Shiro.\" The teacher called out. </p><p>[Yes?] </p><p>\"Since you\'re an ice mage, why don\'t you have a slight spar with me. But you don\'t need to move from your space but instead try to attack me with your magic.\" The teacher suggested. </p><p>[Sure. What\'s my win condition?] </p><p class=\"civsws\"></p><p>\"Hmm, just restrain me within the time limit?\" The teacher smiled. </p><p>[Sure. I\'ll grab a chair so I can sit down in the middle. Get a little comfy.] </p><p>He teacher only shrugged as she waited for Shiro. </p><p>Grabbing a stool, Shiro placed it in the centre before sitting down and crossed her legs. </p><p>[Ready when you are.] Shiro typed out as a light smile hung on her lips. </p><p>Getting her confirmation, the teacher hopped a little on the spot to warm herself up. She\'s heard of how abnormal Shiro was from the other teachers and wanted to see if her experience truly matched up with veterans. </p><p>\"Three!...\" </p><p>The student\'s gathered up in a 50-diameter circle around them as they watched with interest. This was a rare battle between the highest-level student and the sparring teacher. Level 25 Shiro VS a level 35 teacher. </p><p>\"Two!...\" </p><p class=\"civsws\"></p><p>Lyrica watched in anxiousness as she was worried about how Shiro would fair with her arm. </p><p>\"One!...GO!\" </p><p>The teacher shouted as Shiro\'s aura changed instantly. </p><p>*CRRRR!!! </p><p>Ice spread out in a circle with her being the source. The teacher jumped up slightly as she dodged the initial freezing. </p><p>Shiro didn\'t let her off as she flipped her left hand and several ice spikes shot towards the teacher. </p><p>The teacher had a serious expression as she twisted her body and stepped onto the spike before jumping off. </p><p>Not even a second after landing, an ice cage was already halfway formed with her inside it. </p><p>Roundhouse kicking one of the ice spikes, the teacher escaped the entrapment. </p><p class=\"civsws\"></p><p>Before she could even sigh out a breath of relief, the broken shard of the ice cage expanded and latched onto her arm. </p><p>\"Tsk!\" The teacher clicked her tongue before clenching her hand and shattered the ice. </p><p>Seeing this, Shiro could only smile bitterly and shake her head. Her experience and skill were there but the stats were not. </p><p>The teacher could simply overwhelm her with brute strength. </p><p>However, she wouldn\'t go without a fight. </p><p>Her eyes glowed with a slight blue as she snapped her fingers causing an ice forest to appear. </p><p>Waving her left hand, spears shot towards the teacher from the ice trees. </p><p>The teacher was basically attacked from every direction she could have been. To make matters worse, they were fired with different time intervals as it would be hard for her to strike everything down in one go. </p><p>The teacher narrowed her eyes before crossing her arms in front of her and charged towards Shiro. </p><p class=\"civsws\"></p><p>She decided to end this farce and break through with force. </p><p>She saw Shiro\'s smile and frowned. </p><p>[Such a shame. Perhaps if my stats were a little higher, you may be in a pinch.] Shiro shrugged. </p><p>\"What do you mean?\" The teacher asked with a frown. She clearly had Shiro on the ropes yet why is she still saying that \'She\' was the one in a pinch? </p><p>Shiro only smiled as she pointed up. </p><p>The teacher looked up as she saw what was waiting for her. </p><p>The entire sky was covered with countless spears of ice as each one was rotating to increase penetrative power. </p><p>The teacher felt sweat drip down her back as she couldn\'t imagine what would have happened if Shiro was the same level as her. She wouldn\'t have been able to dodge that many nor brute force her way through it. </p><p>Standing up, Shiro tapped the floor with her foot lightly as the ice started to thaw and retract into her palm. </p><p>The teacher stared at Shiro\'s back with a complicated gaze. The feeling of jealousy rose up in her as she realised, she only won due to brute strength. When put in an even playing field, she wouldn\'t have even reached close to her. </p>'),(231,10,'Chapter 22 Shadow Temple p1',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>\"Shiro! That was amazing!\" Lyrica ran over as Shiro smiled. </p><p>[I still lack an ignore defence attack. Without one, I doubt I\'ll be able to challenge those of a higher level too well.] Shiro shook her head. </p><p>If she had the stats, she wouldn\'t have needed to attack the teacher in so many ways to distract her from the main attack above her. And even then, she would have been able to shrug it off. </p><p>\"Eh? But ignore defence skills are rare, and even then, you need to be a high level to get a natural skill.\" Lyrica replied. Defence ignore skills were on high demand as a single one may be the key to turning a battle around. </p><p>Shiro too knew this, but what she was counting on was her Nanomancer class. Each of the firearms come with a passive ignore defence as they dealt heavy damage. The main damage dealer being the sniper rifle. </p><p>When charged with mana, the sniper could even help her deal a few million damage to a monster\'s HP. </p><p>[Call Madison. We\'re going to have her fill her side of the bet from before. We\'re heading into a Dungeon.] Shiro smiled. </p><p>\"Right now?\" Lyrica asked surprised. </p><p>[The Faction recruitment will start in less than a months time. Do you want to still be in the first class while taking the recruitment?] Shiro asked with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>\"Well no but, like… your arm.\" Lyrica said pointing at Shiro\'s arm. </p><p class=\"linruj\"></p><p>[Aiya. Do I have to explain every time? Don\'t worry about it too much. At the very least, I\'ll be assisting you from behind while you take vanguard.] Shiro shrugged. </p><p>The worry Lyrica showed for her was nice, but it was a little too excessive. </p><p>\"I see… I know I\'m asking a lot but since you\'re my first friend, I don\'t want you to be hurt so much.\" Lyrica said as Shiro paused. </p><p>She remembered that Lyrica was still just a 15-year-old girl. She wasn\'t a seasoned veteran like her, nor was she used to putting up a tough front. Lyrica was just showing simple care towards her wellbeing. </p><p>[Lyrica. Why are you so cute?] Shiro grinned patting her head. Seeing Lyrica like this just made Shiro want to pamper her like a child. If she was taller and had busts, maybe burying Lyrica in her b.r.e.a.s.ts while spinning around a little would be fun. </p><p>\"Ha? W-what brought that thought up!\" Lyrica blushed. </p><p>[Ai, so cute. I just want to pamper you!] Shiro wanted to have a voice already as she\'ll be able to ignore the annoying typing and just talk to Lyrica. </p><p>\"Who\'s pampering who?

And you should know the rest.] Shiro smiled. </p><p>\"Which dungeon?\" Madison sat down. They had to adhere to the rules of the bet they make, otherwise, they\'ll have to deal with the reinforcers that make sure the contract is followed. </p><p>[I\'m thinking of challenging Shadow Temple level 15-20.] </p><p>\"…\" </p><p>\"…\" </p><p>Both Lyrica and Madison looked at Shiro like she was an asylum escapist. </p><p>Lyrica tapped Shiro\'s forehead as she frowned. </p><p class=\"linruj\"></p><p>\"Shiro, I know you hurt your arm but did you hurt your brain as well?\" Lyrica asked as Shiro felt like coughing up blood. </p><p>Madison, on the other hand, was too shocked to even speak. </p><p>[No I\'m not crazy. This is actually done after taking account of your fighting style.] Shiro shrugged. </p><p>[Yours as well Madison.] </p><p>\"Huh? Wait what mine?\" Madison replied shocked. </p><p>[Yes. While Lyrica is a more attack orientated fighter, you are more of a defence counter type attacker. Are you trying to advance into a Shield Swordswoman?] </p><p>\"How- Nevermind. Yeah, I want to be a Shield Swordswoman.\" Madison replied. It wasn\'t too hard to figure out the direction a person wanted to proceed onto by looking at combat records. </p><p>So for Shiro to understand, it wasn\'t too surprising. </p><p>[We don\'t necessarily need your two friends there.] Shiro pointed at the two. It would work out if Madison helped them clear the Dungeon, but her two \'friends\' weren\'t needed. </p><p class=\"linruj\"></p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Madison asked. </p><p>[We\'re going to clear the Dungeon with you three filling in the numbers. However, to make the run faster, we\'re gonna have you play the part of the main tank, Lyrica as the offence and me as the offensive support.] </p><p>\"What about us?\" Madison\'s friends asked. </p><p>[I don\'t have a role for you. You can be meat shields if you want.] Shiro shrugged. </p><p>The two were offended but stopped remembering that she\'s a level 25 ice mage. </p><p>[So as I was typing, Madison you\'ll help tank the assassin\'s while Lyrica will kill them. I\'ll be reducing their reaction speed so it should be easier for you two.] She was initially going to do the Dungeon with just her and Lyrica, but knowing that she\'ll not always be around Lyrica, it would be good if she was able to get some experience working in a party. </p><p>What better way than to work up in member count. From three members and eventually extending into a full party. </p><p>[As for you two, join if you want. Just don\'t drag us down.] </p><p>\"We\'re not going to drag you down. Just you wait for us to surpass her contributions.\" They frowned and pointed at Lyrica. </p><p class=\"linruj\"></p><p>Shiro only shrugged as she stood up. </p><p>[In that case, we\'re going to the Shadow Temple straight away. Get your gear if you don\'t have it.] Shiro typed out as she stood up. </p><p>\"What about potions? Don\'t we need to stock up?\" Madison asked. </p><p>\"I can answer this!\" Lyrica cut in not wanting to be left out. </p><p>\"Shiro said that low-quality potions in this city have bad effects later on in the line. The best thing to do is let your wounds heal naturally over time.\" Lyrica replied as Shiro nodded. </p><p>[As Lyrica said, the best thing is to let yourself heal overtime.] </p><p>\"Lyrica may be able to regenerate since she\'s an Elf, and you hardly take damage. However, for us, we can\'t regenerate. Healing potions or a healer is our best option.\" Madison replied. Since Lyrica isn\'t holding them back, her initial anger with her decreased. </p><p>[If that\'s the case then you should try to drink as little as possible. Only drink when necessary.] Shiro replied seeing Madison being so cooperative. </p><p>[We\'ll meet up at the Dungeon in 30 minutes.] Shiro typed out as Madison agreed and left with her friends. </p><p class=\"linruj\"></p><p>\"I thought we\'re supposed to be enemies with her?\" Lyrica asked tilting her head slightly. </p><p>[We were, but that doesn\'t mean we should antagonise each other at every moment.

I won\'t seek out their destruction.] </p><p>\"Hehh~ Shiro\'s kinda like a saint then.\" Lyrica said. </p><p>[Oh please, I\'m no saint. I will kill them in the cruellest way possible if they truly anger me.] </p><p>\'Just ask those scientists.\' Shiro thought as she remembers the sight of the head scientists after she was done with him. The hero killed the other scientists, but she had the honour of torturing him. </p><p>Opening him up, keeping him alive, a little \'Red Carpet\' of his organs, using the nanobots to eat him from the inside out and making sure he felt everything. </p><p>\"What are you smiling about?\" Lyrica asked seeing Shiro smile so happily. </p><p>[I just thought of a really good memory.] </p><p>\"Heh~ Is that so. Are you able to tell me?\" Lyrica asked curiously. </p><p class=\"linruj\"></p><p>[Maybe next time.] </p><p>### </p><p>When it was time to enter the Dungeon, Shiro arrived along with Lyrica. </p><p>[Have you prepared everything?] </p><p>\"Yeah, I just hope you won\'t take this too far. The Dungeon is roughly 3 to 7 levels higher than us after all.\" Madison said. </p><p>[Don\'t worry, the main goal of this Dungeon run is to level up.] Shiro typed out as Madison nodded. </p><p>[Shiro LVL 25 – Ice Mage] </p><p>[Lyrica LVL 12 – Elven Swordswoman] </p><p>[Madison LVL 15 – Swordswoman] </p><p class=\"linruj\">The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld[.]com</p><p>[July LVL 13 – Mage] </p><p>[Karol LVL 14 – Swordswoman] </p><p>Seeing everyone in the party, Shiro keyed them into the Shadow Temple and entered without any problems. </p><p>When their vision cleared, they saw that they were in a dark forest.

There was a long distance till the actual temple as this was the first test. </p><p>They had to survive the assassin\'s onslaughts while they walked towards the temple. </p><p>[I won\'t talk this time so either you or Madison take charge.] Shiro said Lyrica as her goal for this expedition was to see how Lyrica developed. Either as a strong teammate or a reliable leader. </p><p>\"Then I volunteer to be leader.\" Madison said as Lyrica nodded. </p><p>\"Sure. But we\'ll change roles depending on the situation.\" Lyrica replied. </p><p>\"No problems with me.

But seen as though Madison didn\'t even ask her what her basic abilities were, Shiro decided to hold back on it or now. </p><p>That being said, her blizzard was a double-sided blade that would have affected her entire party as well. </p><p>*Clang clang! </p><p>Lyrica blocked two daggers with her blade as the party perked up. </p><p class=\"linruj\"></p><p>\"Let\'s rush through. The assassins don\'t enter the temple.\" Madison said as the party rushed forwards. </p><p>Madison and Lyrica were the main tankers as they would block the assassins while Shiro and July were the ones to clear them up. </p><p>\"Fire ball.\" July would mutter every time she used the skill. </p><p>For junior mages, they had to visualise their attack skills. Saying out the name would help them get a better picture. </p><p>This was due to the fact that the skills they get are more conceptual compared to swordsman skills. </p><p>They had skills such a Sword Cross, Sword Rush and Killing Cut. While mages had Tier 1 ice magic, Tier 1 Fire magic and so on. </p><p>While the mages had wider selections, they needed to visualise the attack or the power decreases. </p><p>Shiro only shook her head before flicking her hands and killed an assassin in one go. </p><p>Due to her needing to memorise the myriad of blueprints for her Nanomancer class, she was used to remembering a lot of things. Simple ice magic and the such were an easy task for her. </p><p class=\"linruj\"></p><p>July gazed at her with her competitive spirit ignited. </p><p>Feeling the gaze, Shiro only smiled as a little competitive spirit amongst children were good. </p><p>Trying to rush through the first trial quickly seemed good at first, but with the amount of assassin\'s increasing, it became harder to progress. </p><p>The pressure on Lyrica was exceptionally huge as she had to block several assassins at once. </p><p>This pressure was both good and bad. Good because it was pushing her attack domain closer to maturity. Bad because this was straining her heavily. </p><p>Shiro could see the sweat drip from her forehead as she was trying her best to protect the party. </p><p>Madison also knew this as the rush approach wasn\'t a good option since their speed wasn\'t high enough. </p><p>They were fine in other departments but they just needed speed. </p><p>Shiro shook her head as the temperature started to drop. </p><p class=\"linruj\"></p><p>Madison paused seeing a snowflake drop in front of her. Her arms were getting goosebumps as it was getting colder and colder. </p><p>The snow increased at a visible pace as they soon realised it was Shiro causing all of this. </p><p>Raising up her hand, Shiro increased the snow before clutching her fist. </p><p>The storm expanded as the blizzard howled in their ears. </p><p>Their body shivered as frost could be seen forming on their skins. </p><p>\"Hey! Shiro! Stop it! You\'re going to kill us!\" Madison shouted. </p><p>\"Madison, look outside.\" Lyrica said pointing outside. </p><p>The storm was raging as they could barely see past it. There were ice statues for which they could recognise to be the assassin\'s earlier. </p><p>The only reason why they were freezing up as well was due to the unavoidable side effect of using Shiro\'s ice and snow magic. </p><p class=\"linruj\"></p><p>She was fine, but they weren\'t. Even when she did try to let the blizzard avoid their location, the temperature was still dropping significantly. </p><p>[Madison, let Lyrica be leader.] Shiro typed out as Madison nodded.

She only helped as much as needed and never more. Just the bare minimum to keep them alive. </p>'),(232,10,'Chapter 23 Shadow Temple p2',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>[Lyrica you take the lead. How would you exit this situation without my help?] </p><p>\"Hmm… I would take the time to kill every assassin and secure a resting zone for the moment. Get our stamina back before continuing.\" Lyrica said as Shiro only smiled. </p><p>The correct answer would have been to retreat. If they didn\'t have her, they would have party wiped and died right there. </p><p>[Lyrica. That would have led to everyone dying.] </p><p>\"Huh? What do you mean?\" Lyrica was puzzled. </p><p>[Look outside. How many more assassins do you think there are? If not for my blizzard, do you think they\'ll give you guys room to regain stamina?] Shiro asked as Lyrica paused in understanding. </p><p>\'If Shiro wasn\'t here, we wouldn\'t even have the time to breathe. Entering deeper would only lead to death. Everyone is under levelled and Shiro is the only high level. Without her, there no hope…\' Lyrica thought as she smiled bitterly. </p><p>\"The correct answer was we should have left and regrouped a little, right?\" Lyrica said. </p><p>[Indeed. But since our main goal is to level up, you guys regain your stamina. I haven\'t killed them yet, just put them into stasis.] Shiro typed out as they sat down. </p><p>After recovering, Shiro waved her hands and the blizzard started to fade away. </p><p class=\"kjzykw\"></p><p>[Kill them now before they unfreeze.] </p><p>Lyrica only nodded as she dashed towards a group of frozen assassins. </p><p>Twirling the dual ended poison blade, she smashed two before twisting her body and smashed another one. </p><p>Madison was shocked seeing how eager Lyrica was to get EXP through killing the assassins. Running to kill an assassin, she didn\'t want to be left out. </p><p>[Contributions] </p><p>Shiro – 32% </p><p>Lyrica – 29% </p><p>Madison – 18% </p><p>July – 13% </p><p class=\"kjzykw\"></p><p>Karol – 8% </p><p>The loot received from the assassins were distributed but Shiro didn\'t get anything useful. None of them were blacksmiths or alchemists so she just recycled the miscellaneous items. </p><p>Resting up for a moment, they walked towards the temple at a leisurely pace. </p><p>The reason why Shiro picked the Shadow Temple for the Dungeon to level up Lyrica in was due to the temple in the middle. </p><p>It is the Shadow Trial Temple. </p><p>The Shadow Trial Temple gave a few scenarios and challenged to the party entering the temple. If they succeed in the challenges, they were granted a boost in EXP. If completed to a good degree, they were guaranteed a level up. A great degree was roughly a level and a 20% boost into the next level. </p><p>An amazing degree gave almost 2 levels and finally, the perfect degree gave a treasure and 2 levels. </p><p>Naturally, one would think about entering the Dungeon when they\'re higher level to gain more experience. But, the challenges increase in difficulty dramatically the higher level you are. Which is why Shiro\'s main goal was for Lyrica to level up in the temple. </p><p>There were 5 challenges as each one represented a stat in one\'s status board except for health. </p><p class=\"kjzykw\"></p><p>Strength Challenge, Mana Challenge, Speed Challenge, Dexterity Challenge and Defence Challenge. </p><p>Each challenge had a boss one had to defeat in the respective category. </p><p>This is when it was recommended for one to be a lower level. The lower level you are, the easier the bosses will be and the easier it was to defeat them. </p><p>When challenging the trials, they\'ll enter separate rooms and won\'t see each other\'s progress. </p><p>Thankfully, the danger of death didn\'t appear here as the only dangerous area was the start area. </p><p>Entering the dungeon, they were greeted with a pit of black fire and 6 challenge doors next to the black fire. </p><p>The strength door had the carving of a muscular arm. The mana trial had a magic circle. The speed trial had a carving of a pair of boots. Dexterity a pair or hands and the defence had a shield. </p><p>[Which trial do you want to enter?] Shiro asked. </p><p>\"Let\'s do them from left to right. So Strength trial first.\" Lyrica said pointing at the strength trial. </p><p class=\"kjzykw\"></p><p>\"No. I\'d say we do the defence trial first. Do it while we aren\'t fatigued yet.\" Madison disagreed. </p><p>Lyrica frowned as she had her own reason to choose strength. </p><p>\"If we do strength, we have our full power to complete it. There aren\'t any guarantees for the defence trial. We should get what we can, WHILE we can.\" Lyrica argued back. </p><p>\"But if we do the defence now, we\'ll be able to at least complete one of each. While not being able to gain a good result from a single door, we can get a decent result from all the doors.\" </p><p>\'So Madison is more of a person who focuses on the wider goal, while Lyrica is a person who focuses more on a single goal.\' Shiro thought with interest. </p><p>\'That meaning Lyrica is better off being the solo teammate that is highly reliable, while Madison is the leader who focuses on the group status rather than a single person.\' </p><p>\"Shiro! What do you think we should do?\" Lyrica asked as they couldn\'t come to an agreement. </p><p>[You want my opinion? Then I would say focus on the single rather than overall.] Shiro shrugged. </p><p>Choosing the overall good was and never will be a task for her. No matter her power, her control, she\'ll rather focus on those who have her favour. Lyrica being the first one in this world to gain her favour. </p><p class=\"kjzykw\"></p><p>\"Che.\" Madison clicked her tongue in annoyance while Lyrica beamed happily. </p><p>Walking up the strength door, they placed their palms on the cold stone. </p><p>[Do you wish to take the Strength Test of the Shadow Temple?] </p><p>Clicking yes, they were teleported to another room. </p><p>The light was blinding as Shiro was forced to use her left hand to cover her eyes. </p><p>When she opened then once more, she found that she was within a medieval castle. large pillars supported the ceiling as she could see golden chandeliers hanging from the roof. A red carpet was laid out before her and she wasn\'t alone. </p><p>To her left, a beast with 2 pairs of arms, void purple muscles, golden eyes, two crescent horns with a scaled spine and tail. </p><p>To her right, a delicate looking female with light blue hair, pointed ears, golden eyes, standing at roughly 5ft 8, she was a beauty. </p><p>[As the first monster to enter the Shadow Temples, you have given permission to attempt the Dungeon Story: Kingdom\'s survival.] </p><p class=\"kjzykw\"></p><p>\"Kingdom\'s survival?...\" Shiro mutter. </p><p>\"Did you say something my liege?\" The woman asked as Shiro looked over. </p><p>\"Ah, nothing.\" She replied. </p><p>[Story Quest: Kingdom\'s survival. </p><p>You are the ruler of the Yin Kingdom of the east.

The quests have different objectives as the adventurer had to complete the main one. </p><p>Doing so will grant the adventurer bountiful rewards while failing did no harm except for a drop in level. </p><p>Shiro\'s mind worked fast as acting awkward could decrease your credibility in the situation. </p><p class=\"kjzykw\"></p><p>\"Fei Ling, can you tell me about the current situation?\" Shiro said with a stern face. Her appearance was still the same so it was a little odd due to her tone. However, Fei Ling didn\'t seem to notice. </p><p>\"My liege, we have the Thunder King and his army of 500 thousand approaching with an estimated time of 3 days. The fire queen with her army of 200 thousand in 4 days. The beast kingdom with 10 thousand strong monsters in 2 days and the ocean king blocking out escape through the sea as of this moment.\" Fei Ling replied. </p><p>\"How many capable men do we have?\" Shiro asked. </p><p>\"Currently, we have 100 thousand capable warriors ready to lay their lives down for the Yin kingdom.\" </p><p>\"I see…\" Shiro muttered. </p><p>\"Tell me which direction the enemies are coming from.\" </p><p>\"Thunder king from the north, Fire queen from the east, Beast kingdom from the west and the ocean king from the south.\" </p><p>\'Hmm… the situation is bad for trying to tough it out. The most dangerous is the Thunder King then the Fire Queen. I need to try turn her favour around with enough firepower to defeat the Thunder King. However, not only do I need my own bargaining chip, but I also need to resolve an issue of why they target this kingdom.\' Shiro thought. </p><p>She was able to quickly adapt to the quest as her motto had always been to revolve around being flexible. </p><p class=\"kjzykw\"></p><p>\"Fei Ling, why did they target my kingdom again. This stress has gotten to me.\" Shiro said massaging her eyes. </p><p>\"My liege, they target us because of your treasure, did you forget?\" </p><p>\"Do remind me. I have a treasury of items; I don\'t know each and every one of them.\" Shiro shrugged. </p><p>\"It is an item called the fabricator. We inject mana and it ejects items. Though the items must be detailed and fully imagined by the user. If a single piece of mistake occurs, the item is destroyed.\" </p><p>\'Fabricator…. For something sounding like that, the mana to material conversion has to be small. Therefore to make the most out of it, I must make something small but powerful….\' Shiro though. </p><p>She had an idea for a weapon to help them out but whether or not the fabricator can create it was another problem. </p><p>\"Take me to the fabricator, I want to check something.\" Shiro said as Fei Ling nodded. </p><p>Stepping out of the throne room from what it seemed, they walked towards the treasury with the void beast behind them. </p><p>Curious, Shiro decided to open her status board. </p><p class=\"kjzykw\"></p><p>[Temporary Status] </p><p>HP: 1,400,000/1,400,000 </p><p>MP: 5,000,000/5,000,000 </p><p>She frowned a little seeing her stats as just an HP bar and MP bar. </p><p>However, if what she planned can be made, then the HP and MP could just be ignored. </p><p>She wasn\'t going to fight her way out of a hopeless situation if she could have a hopeful situation. </p><p>Arriving at the treasury, Fei Ling brought out an orb. </p><p>The orb itself was coloured silver in colour and it was the size of a football. </p><p>[Fabricator (Red)] </p><p class=\"kjzykw\"></p><p>Can make anything as long as it has the mana and the necessary knowledge. </p><p>\'Hmm…\' Shiro thought as she decided to test out something. </p><p>Closing her eyes, she started to imagine a pistol. </p><p>The frame, the recoil spring, the slider, the barrel, trigger, the hammer, extractor, the loader, the grip and so on. </p><p>The visualisation of the pistol became clearer as the orb shun with a silver glow. </p><p>Fei Ling stood by the side as she watched Shiro use the fabricator. </p><p>[Fabrication complete.] </p><p>Product = Simple Pistol – MP cost = 3,000,000 </p><p>Opening her eyes once more, Shiro frowned seeing the insane MP cost. Due to the fact that she was fabricating the pistol out of pure mana, it takes more MP to solidify into a suitable frame. </p><p class=\"kjzykw\"></p><p>\"Fei Ling. How much mana are we able to extract from our residents?\" Shiro asked. </p><p>\"I do not know, but definitely above 50 million should we include our fighting force. Though if we were to use them as well, I\'m not sure if they can protect the kingdom to their full potential.\" Fei Ling replied understanding that Shiro wanted to use their mana. </p><p>\"Do we have anything to store that mana if we extract them? If we do, go set up a public donation under the pretence of donating a little mana to help save the kingdom.\" Shiro ordered. This situation itself seemed fun as Shiro wanted to see if she could truly complete the quest using an unorthodox method. </p><p>First, she needed a few important parts to this. A reactor, a primer, a compressor, a remote and the shell. </p><p>The reactor must be highly reactive and she needed a compressor to condense down the energy. </p><p>Getting a general blueprint in her mind, Shiro started to focus on the fabricator. </p><p>\'From the inside out, the first part is the core. A hollowed sphere of reactive material, followed by the explosive compressor. Inside the hollowed sphere, I also need to add another distributor to get the reaction needed from the core. </p><p>Outside of the core, I need more compressors before finally finishing with the receiver what will help detonate all of this.\' Shiro thought closing her eyes. </p><p>The fabricator glowed a silver light before it recorded the blueprint successfully. </p><p class=\"kjzykw\"></p><p>Shiro grinned seeing this. </p><p>She had no need for an army, no need for complicated relations to survive. Not if she had this on her side as the tipping point for this war. </p><p>She won\'t be the one seeking them out, they\'ll be the one begging her to stop. </p><p>[Fabrication Complete] </p><p>Product = Remotely Activated Atomic Mana Pulse Bomb – MP cost = 100,000,000 </p>'),(233,10,'Chapter 24 Shadow Temple p3',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>[Fabrication Complete] </p><p>Product = Remotely Activated Atomic Mana Pulse Bomb – MP cost = 100,000,000 </p><p>That being said, just relying on this bomb couldn\'t solve everything.

The most optimal number would be two. </p><p>With two, they would have the mental thought that she may have another. With that thought implanted, they can\'t risk it thus granting her a natural advantage over the relations. </p><p>\'First step is to send out a message to the fire queen. Ask for a join operation as the thunder king is the biggest threat. Suggest to her that I have something to show my power and she would be collateral if she rejects.\' Shiro thought. </p><p>\"But… it\'ll be a waste to not make the most of my time here.\" She muttered. </p><p>Being set in a situation like this could provide her with more opportunities. </p><p>Martial Arts, technological theories, mana manipulation and most importantly, skills for her ice magic. </p><p class=\"pdtehg\"></p><p>Since she was focused on nanomancery in her past life, she had no experience with ice magic outside of the rudimentary level. Whilst she did have theories for reaching extreme essences of ice for it to start \'burning\', that was too far down the line that it wouldn\'t help for the time being. </p><p>Her current arsenal with the ice was very simple, a field which makes it efficient, spears, pillars and the such. She was just throwing ice at people rather than using them to the best abilities. </p><p>Walking around the castle, Shiro tried to look for Fei Ling but paused when she realised an important fact. </p><p>She was lost… </p><p>\"….f*ck.\" Was all she could mutter realising this. </p><p>Mustering up mana, Shiro wanted to use ice but realised her mana was that of the shadow attribute. </p><p>\"Hmm…. If that\'s the case then this might work.\" She muttered as a dark purple mist surrounded her. </p><p>Walking towards the wall, her body started to flow into the gaps and walked towards the throne room. </p><p>Seeing the void beast still there, she sighed in relief. </p><p class=\"pdtehg\"></p><p>\"Void Beast, can you go call Fei Ling for me?\" Shiro said, not sure if the beast could understand her. </p><p>Thankfully, it did as it nodded and started to leave. </p><p>Sitting back onto the throne, Shiro started to plan out her course of action. </p><p>Stage 1: Gather the needed mana for the atomic mana pulse bomb. </p><p>Stage 2: Send a messenger to form relations with the fire queen. </p><p>Stage 3: Detonate the bomb in the thunder kings army to weaken them. </p><p>This was her plan of action in a nutshell. In between each stage, she would need to work hard to make it a success. </p><p>\"You called for me my liege?\" Fei Ling said as she bowed. </p><p>\"I need your help with a task. I need to send a message to the fire queen about a friendly treaty. Also, I want you to help me gather books about the use of ice magic, martial arts and technological theories.\" Shiro said as Fei Ling nodded. </p><p class=\"pdtehg\"></p><p>\"In which order do you wish that I fulfil these tasks?\" </p><p>\"Help me gather the books first and the public donations. After that, you can send the message to her.\" Shiro said as Fei Ling nodded. </p><p>Sitting on the throne, Shiro felt a little idle. She was just waiting for the jobs to be done and not partaken in the jobs themselves. </p><p>\"Hmm…. Maybe I should learn some martial arts to improve my close quarter combat.\" Shiro muttered as this spare time gave her a moment to think to herself. </p><p>Closing her eyes, she decided to recount the times she had seen the hero and her party members fight. </p><p>Their use of recoil, their use of momentum shift, the centre of gravity, battle instincts and finally, force shift. </p><p>Each and every one of them can help a person dramatically should they now even just a little. </p><p>Remembering a routine the fighter of their party once did, Shiro walked off the throne and crouched low. </p><p>In slow steady movements, she lifted up her left arm to the height of her head and the right arm in front for the attack. </p><p class=\"pdtehg\"></p><p>\'Lock the joints before the attack, store the kinetic force. Like a gun, hammer out the force in one go!\' Shiro thought as she slowly reeled her right arm back. </p><p>Moving into a stance with a strong centre of gravity. Shiro took a deep breath in and out as her iris\'s narrowed. </p><p>Punching forward, Shiro used a little too much strength as the momentum carried her body with it a little. </p><p>She frowned before looking at her hands. </p><p>\'My body isn\'t suited for power combat. I need a counter force martial art style. Preferably one to do with flexibility.\' She thought. </p><p>Her current close combat didn\'t include any styles as she was just barely able to shift her momentum. Her natural advantage would be her instant acceleration. </p><p>The ability to go from 0 speed to max speed in a single short burst. </p><p>While she couldn\'t use the ability to her fullest due to the new body, she still remembered the sensation, therefore, making it easier for her. </p><p>In the time of her musing, Fei Ling returned with a stack of doc.u.ments. </p><p class=\"pdtehg\"></p><p>\"My liege, here are the books you asked for. I found every book regarding to ice magic, technological theories and the most suitable martial arts manuals for you.\" Fei Ling said placing the books down. </p><p>\"Thanks.\" Shiro smiled. </p><p>\"It was but a simple task. The letter and the hawk are ready. You may write the details and send it off at any moment you want.\" </p><p>Shiro nodded as she picked up the ice magic books. </p><p>Seeing the contents, she smiled bitterly as the book was a blur. </p><p>\'Of course it won\'t be this easy.\' Shiro thought as she had another way of getting what she wants. </p><p>\"Fei Ling, what martial arts do you use?\" Shiro asked. </p><p>\"I use the Yin Style Phantom Arts.\" </p><p>\"Do explain the style to me. I\'m rather interested.\" Shiro said as Fei Ling nodded. </p><p class=\"pdtehg\"></p><p>\"The Yin Style Phantom Arts are a set of martial arts designed for women. It requires excellent flexibility and counter judgement. The main focus is to not be hit like a phantom while striking a shock through their bodies. </p><p>When we are hit, we redirect the force in the shape of momentum and strike back at our enemies. </p><p>However, that is the fail-safe of the Yin Style Phantom Arts. We should try to not get hit at all if that is possible. The users of this style are like a phantom. Silent yet powerful, without form yet corporeal.\" Fei Ling replied. </p><p>\"Oh? Do you think my body suits this type of martial arts?\" Shiro asked with interest. </p><p>\"My liege is a mage, therefore I cannot say. But, I believe with enough effort, one can learn anything even if it\'s just the rudimentary.\" Fei Ling replied honestly. </p><p>\"Very well. Since that is the case, why don\'t you show me the entire Yin Style Phantom Arts?\" Shiro smiled. Her memory was incredible so she believes she can remember this style even when she leaves. </p><p>As Lyrica had previously stated, take advantage of what you can, WHILE you can. </p><p>Fei Ling nodded as she stepped away and walked to the centre of the room. </p><p>\"The Phantom Arts revolves around 5 main concepts. 1st Phantom, illusionary phantom. 2nd Phantom, speed phantom. 3rd Phantom, counterweight phantom. 4th Phantom, internal feasting phantom. 5th Phantom, the soul stealing phantom.\" Fei Ling said as Shiro nodded, recording this into her database. </p><p class=\"pdtehg\"></p><p>\"The illusionary phantom takes advantage of blind spots and misdirection. You are a mirage, so close yet so far.\" </p><p>Shifting her leg a little, Fei Ling raised her arms as she moved in a flowing motion. Before Shiro realised, Fei Ling was already in front of her. </p><p>\"Trick the eyes, trick the mind. Strike at the weakness.\" </p><p>\"Second Phantom. Speed Phantom. A set of footwork that focuses on minimal usage for the biggest gain. The constant contraction and the relaxation of your muscles.\" </p><p>In a blink of an eye, Fei Ling was already across the room. </p><p>\"Third Phantom. Counterweight phantom. This form focuses on the art of redirection as we primarily use the legs to counter. Fourth Phantom. The internal feasting phantom. We focus our strikes like a needle to damage the weakened body being the tough outer shell. Fifth Phantom. Soul stealing phantom. Pure attack, no defence. Go for the kill and nothing less.\" </p><p>Seeing her demonstrate each of the moves, Shiro made sure to record everything down. </p><p>A few hours passed in a flash as Fei Ling was patient enough to teach her all the moves. </p><p>Closing her eyes, Shiro absorbed the knowledge as she thought about combining a few moves with her current arsenal. </p><p class=\"pdtehg\"></p><p>\"Fei Ling. Let\'s have a little spar.\" Shiro said as Fei Ling didn\'t understand. </p><p>\"My liege, you can overwhelm me easily. Why is there a need for a spar?\" </p><p>\"Because I wish to test out what I\'ve learnt.\" Shiro\'s voice rang out from behind Fei Ling as she shivered. </p><p>Her guard was dropped for a moment as Shiro had already managed to get behind her using the illusory phantom in the most basic form. </p><p>\"As you wish my liege.\" Fei Ling replied as they separated. </p><p>They didn\'t get into any stance as there were no basic stances for the Phantom Arts. </p><p>They had to flexible and adapt to change. From no stance to every stance. They must not stick to anything like the shape of a phantom. Forever changing. </p><p>\'First Phantom: Illusionary Phantom!\' </p><p>Their body faded for a moment before reappearing in front of each other. Fei Ling was able to continuously get behind Shiro causing her to frown. </p><p class=\"pdtehg\"></p><p>\'Second Phantom: Speed Phantom!\' </p><p>Tapping lightly on the ground, Shiro landed on the ceiling before rebounding towards Fei Ling. </p><p>She casually stepped sideways as she bent her leg towards Shiro. </p><p>\'Third Phantom: Counterweight Phantom!\' </p><p>Twisting her body, Shiro kicked similarity and redirected Fei Ling\'s kick. </p><p>*CRACK!!! </p><p>Fei Ling was astonished as she never believed anyone could be able to learn a set of martial arts this well in a few hours. Albeit a little on the rudimentary side, it was never the less impressive of her. </p><p>\'Fourth Phantom: Internal Feasting Phantom!\' </p><p>Shiro narrowed her eyes as she pivoted on her right leg as a central point before striking downwards with her left leg. </p><p class=\"pdtehg\"></p><p>Fei Ling smiled slightly before stepping back just before the kick hit. </p><p>The only downside to Shiro would be her lack of reach. Her area of influence was rather short as she had to get close and personal to make the most of her skills. </p><p>Even though Fei Ling dodged her kick, Shiro didn\'t mind as she could transaction into another attack. </p><p>Changing the kick into a stomp, Shiro c.o.c.ked her elbow as force gathered in her arms. </p><p>Punching forwards, Fei Ling dodged into the fist and almost phased through like a phantom. </p><p>Tapping Shiro\'s inner elbow and pushing the fist, Fei Ling redirected the force. </p><p>\"Tsk.\" Shiro clicked her tongue as she pivoted on her foot and increased her momentum to kick towards her head. </p><p>Fei Ling kept her composure as she crouched down and supported her entire both with just her right arm. </p><p>Placing her left foot behind Shiro\'s knee, she gently kicked Shiro\'s torso forcing her attack away. </p><p class=\"pdtehg\"></p><p>Flipping backwards, Shiro created some distance as she had a grin on her face. </p><p>This was the martial arts she wanted. It fit with her fighting style as well due to the high requirements for body control and flexibility. </p><p>\"My liege, you are a genius for understanding the rudimentary of the Yin Style Phantom Arts in a short while. However, do keep in mind the weakness of the Phantom Arts. Our reach, defence and the overall attacking options. The Phantom Arts are primarily used for countering therefore, unless they are the attacking force, our exhibited power is reduced by a lot.\" Fei Ling said with a bow. </p><p>\"Are you able to write a quick page about the Phantom Art\'s?\" Shiro asked. </p><p>\"Indeed, I can.\" Fei Ling nodded and grabbed a piece of paper before starting to write down the Phantom Arts. </p><p>\"Just a page will do.\" Shiro reminded as she wanted to see if she could see the contents. </p><p>Looking at the blurred writing, Shiro could only sigh as this meant that she\'ll have to develop her proficiency in the phantom arts later. </p><p>\"Forget about this. I\'ll send the letter to the fire queen.\" Shiro said as she sat on the throne and crossed her legs. </p><p>Writing down the letter, she gave it to Fei Ling to be sent. </p><p>[Time remaining until ever army surrounds Yin Kingdom : 3 days] </p>'),(234,10,'Chapter 25 Shadow Temple p4',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>\"Haaa….\" The fire queen sighed out.

From their queen.\" A servant said. </p><p>\"I dare say, you haven\'t checked the contents have you?\" The fire queen said narrowing her eyes. </p><p class=\"pewkkl\"></p><p>From confidential matters like this, having a servant read the letter would be detrimental. </p><p>\"I don\'t dare empress.\" </p><p>\"Mn.\" The fire queen nodded and retrieved the letter. </p><p>Opening it up, the queen was shocked. </p><p>[Fire queen, I\'m going to keep this short. Would you like to form an alliance with me? We both know the power of the thunder king being too big for the world. However, recently, I have managed to develop a weapon of mass destruction using the power of the fabricator. A single use will allow me to wipe out over 200 thousand of the thunder kings men with ease. </p><p>As a fellow oppressed ruler\'s, I do not wish to involve you in the massacre if I can avoid it. Naturally, you may also choose to ignore my warning and be caught in the collateral. You can think this as a threat, I don\'t intend to hide that fact. </p><p>But the simple statement remains. Join and live or ignore and die. Your choice. </p><p>If you do not believe me, you may see the destruction for yourself in time when the thunder king arrives. Pray that you aren\'t too close to the site or else some collateral damage will affect your army as well. </p><p>Queen of the Yin Kingdom – Shiro] </p><p class=\"pewkkl\"></p><p>\"Kek, this little dumpling is rather feisty. Just her writing tells me of her tone.\" The fire empress muttered. </p><p>\"Pardon my empress?\" The servant asked. </p><p>\"Nothing, you may leave.\" She waved her hand. </p><p>\'For her to adopt an attitude of me being the one wanting the alliance could mean a lot of things. But primarily, it doesn\'t matter if I joined or not. She can probably deal with this with her new weapon.\' The empress thought with a serious face. </p><p>She had to tread carefully. Between Shiro and the thunder king, she would rather Shiro win as their military power is bigger than Shiro\'s. However, if Shiro can give out what she promised, then she really couldn\'t hold a candle Shiro and her kingdom. They\'ll become the biggest threat. </p><p>\"Yet for her to ask for an alliance means there are still complications on her side. She desires this alliance but isn\'t solo focused on it. A convenient boon if anything. </p><p>Thus, meaning she doesn\'t mind using the weapon on me as well… hahaha, I\'m guessing she doesn\'t see this situation as a threat. But merely a playground for her weapon. Another day in her life.\" The queen chuckled as she examined the attitude Shiro adopted. </p><p>\"But… This empress doesn\'t like to be threatened. Should the little dumpling\'s weapon be not up to standard, she can bet I\'ll be going after her head.\" The fire queen muttered with a cold glint in her eye. </p><p>In the end, she didn\'t mind who comes out victorious. Rather, she didn\'t mind them weakening each other in the war. The more men they lose, the easier it was for her to overtake either of them in the end. </p><p class=\"pewkkl\"></p><p>### </p><p>\"How\'re the public donations?\" Shiro asked. </p><p>\"Due to the urgency of the situation, many have been very willing to donate all of their mana. With that being said, a lot of our denizens have already migrated due to the current affairs. Our total tally for MP gathers amounts to 43 million.\" Fei Ling reported. </p><p>\"Hais… how far can they even go? If the thunder king is who you say he is, then he\'ll rather kill a kingdom than to let a c.o.c.kroach survive. Running away now is just speeding up their death.\" Shiro shook her head. </p><p>\"But 43 million, the weapon needs 100 million. We have 2 more days at most which should be barely enough time. As for the manoeuvres we have to pull after the weapon drops, we will have to adopt a wait and see approach.\" She sighed. </p><p>\"My liege, to explain to this servant why you believe this weapon is the turning point?\" Fei Ling asked. </p><p>\"What do you think of a moment in your life that you were met with unstoppable power?\" </p><p>\"Under certain circ.u.mstances, I should try to run.\" Fei Ling replied. </p><p>\"Now, what if you can\'t run?\" </p><p class=\"pewkkl\"></p><p>\"I\'ll try to fight.\" </p><p>\"And the final question, what if you couldn\'t even fight it?\" </p><p>\"I\'ll die trying.\" Fei Ling replied with determination. </p><p>\"Indeed, but do you think a tyrant like thunder king will be the same?\" </p><p>\"I believe he will still fight as he is stubborn.\" Fei Ling said unsure as to why Shiro pointed out his strong personality. </p><p>\"Naturally. Now, I want you to consider his subjects.\" Shiro said with a glimmer in her eye. </p><p>\"His subjects?...\" </p><p>\"You still don\'t get it. This isn\'t a fight between kings and individuals but rather the army. Since he is so oppressive and favours an iron fist. Do you think his subjects are truly loyal?\" Shiro grinned with her eye narrowed. </p><p>The face which didn\'t belong to the body of a young child caused Fei Ling to shiver. </p><p class=\"pewkkl\"></p><p>\"The faith and anger the people have against the thunder king is our advantage. Humans don\'t like to be restrained harshly, it\'s their natural instinct. When faced against something so terrifying that it breaks their will they\'ll try to leave. </p><p>With thunder king\'s attitude, he\'ll kill the leavers and force them to fight.\" Shiro explained with a gesture of her open palm. </p><p>\"When you give that fear an extra push and douse them with promises and a way out, do you think they\'ll take that? In other words…\" </p><p>\"A rebellion…\" Fei Ling muttered realising Shiro had already simulated the situation with the description of the thunder king she had given her. </p><p>\"Indeed. The thunder king would force his subjects to fight but when I give them that extra ray of hope, I covert his army into my pawns. </p><p>With his ego and personality, he would never believe something he did was wrong. So this battle will serve as the guillotine to put a crack into his mind. </p><p>And when the fire queen chooses a side due to my weapon, the crack becomes a deadly fissure that will split him in half.\" Shiro smiled sinisterly as she clenched her fist. </p><p>\"A broken king is no opponent, mere trash by the roadside. Killing him then will be a mercy.\" Shiro said tilting her head back. </p><p>\"But that being said Fei Ling… A king is a lonely position. No matter how strong you are, there are times when you are tested. A tyrant like the thunder king has no companions to support his burden. </p><p class=\"pewkkl\"></p><p>No one he can trust, no one who can help him. He is wary of every subject under him. Who will betray him, who will stick with him? The constant pressure placed on him tires him out. </p><p>Fei Ling, will you be my right-hand woman? One who I can trust, one who I can leave my back to and one who I can call a friend.\" Shiro said looking at Fei Ling. </p><p>\"…\" </p><p>Fei ling kneeled on her right leg as she placed her hand over her heart. </p><p>\"To I, Fei Ling, there was no greater honour than to serve you my liege. But I was wrong, the highest honour would be to accompany a king not as a servant, but as a friend to support his back and share the burden. </p><p>If I were to be as rude, I indeed wish to become my liege\'s right-hand woman and friend.\" Fei Ling said as Shiro smiled. </p><p>\"Then please call me liege no more. Call me Shiro as you are my friend before servant.\" Shiro said standing up and placed her hand over Fei Ling\'s shoulder. </p><p>\"Yes, my L- Shiro.\" Fei Ling corrected herself with a smile. </p><p>Shiro grinned seeing the change in attitude. </p><p class=\"pewkkl\"></p><p>\"Either way, we\'re playing the waiting game now. Once we collected enough mana, they\'ll be dancing in my palms.\" Shiro shrugged. </p><p>\"So let\'s use the rest of these days to improve the Yin Style Phantom Arts.\" </p><p>\"As you wish Shiro.\" </p><p>### </p><p>\"Shiro, we got 100 million mana now.\" Fei Ling said walking into the throne room. </p><p>She saw Shiro examining the orb as she looked up. </p><p>\"Pass me the mana first. Afterwards, keep collecting.\" Shiro said as Fei Ling nodded. </p><p>The storage for the mana was a neon green crystal. Shiro grabbed it and saw the information. </p><p>[Extreme Mana Storage (Red)] </p><p class=\"pewkkl\"></p><p>100,000,290/500,000,000 </p><p>\"Oh my. A maximum storage of 500 million.\" Shiro muttered in surprise. </p><p>Transferring the 100 million mana to the orb, she returned to crystal back to Fei Ling. </p><p>\"Try to gather as much as you can. We still have a day left until the thunder king arrives.\" Shiro said as she nodded. </p><p>Leaving the throne room, Fei Ling went to continue with the public donation\'s. </p><p>[Fabricator Stored MP: 125,000,000] </p><p>In her time of waiting, she would deposit all of her MP into the fabricator. </p><p>Seeing the 9 digit number, Shiro sighed as it was going to be gone in a few short moments. </p><p>[Remotely Activated Atomic Mana Pulse Bomb created. -100,000,000 stored MP] </p><p class=\"pewkkl\"></p><p>Looking at the bomb in her hands, Shiro grinned. </p><p>The remotely activated Atomic Mana Pulse Bomb or the mana nuke, has enough power to wipe out anything in a radius of 30 miles. Naturally, it won\'t activate unless primed with the remote. </p><p>Only after the remote is broken, can the bomb be activated using physical force. </p><p>The best part about the bomb is that it is almost impossible to dodge. The speed of which it sends out the explosive pulse was too fast for most to dodge. Shiro in her prime with nano tech supporting her might be able to barely outrun it. BARELY. And that was when she was the strongest in the world. </p><p>Flicking her hand, Shiro summoned a shadow soldier. </p><p>Over the course of an entire day, she managed to figure out some of the skills that came with her current abilities. </p><p>Instructing it to place the bomb roughly 35 miles away from the kingdom, Shiro sent a shadow bird to make sure it was in the correct space. </p><p>Covering her eye with her right hand, Shiro saw what the bird saw. </p><p>\"Go.\" She said as both the bird and the soldier dashed out the throne room. </p><p class=\"pewkkl\"></p><p>There was only 1 day left before the thunder king\'s arrival. </p><p>Crossing her legs, Shiro had a smile on her face thinking of the surprise she had in stock for him. </p><p>\"Kufufufu, the feeling of playing someone around your palm is quite enjoyable…\" Shiro muttered. </p><p>Right now she was like Buddha tricking the monkey king. No matter what the thunder king did, he would lose. </p><p>Retreat? Sorry, that just gives her more time to make another bomb. </p><p>Attack? Sorry, this miss already has a bomb ready for you. </p><p>Hide?

She had a pair of large, watery eyes and was radiantly beautiful. However, her body looked frail due to malnutrition.</p><p>Seeing everyone look at her with disdain and hate, she felt wronged and choked, “That jade… is… It is mine! I’m… I’m not a thief! My mom left that behind for me!”</p><p>“So what you’re saying is that I stole your stuff?!” Standing opposite her was a girl about her age. Tilting her head, the girl eyed her coldly before she turned to smile innocently at the other children.</p><p>Compared to her, the girl looked sweet and proud, as though she were a lofty, little princess showered with everyone’s love.</p><p>As soon as she spoke, the children around them immediately came to her defense.</p><p>“You’re obviously lying! You’re lying! Why would Rou’er steal your stuff?!”</p><p>“Right, right! That’s impossible! How is Rou’er a thief? Clearly, it’s you who stole her thing!”</p><p>Faced with all their condemnations and questions, the girl was unable to give any convincing explanations to defend herself. Absolutely aggrieved, she rubbed her eyes bitterly and burst into tears.</p><p>“That is really my jade! Give it back….”</p><p>Rou’er eyed her gloatingly and turned to speak to everyone, “Everyone, it’s clear! Xiaoshi is the thief! Don’t play with her anymore! Thieves are bad!”</p><p>Several children vigorously nodded their heads. “Uh-huh! Let’s listen to Princess Rou’er! Ignore her in future! She’s a thief!”</p><p>“She’s a thief! Xiaoshi is a bad girl! Stealing Rou’er’s thing, shame on you!”</p><p>The children roared with laughter as they dispersed. Alone, the girl leaned against a wall. She held back her tears as she gazed at the other children’s backs, tightly clenching her fists.</p><p>***</p><p>A row of men clad in black suits lined up outside the director’s office.</p><p>An energetic-looking elderly man past fifty sat sternly on a sofa. The set of traditional Chinese garments on him enhanced his respectable demeanor, and under the shadows of his brows was an air of fury.</p><p>He might be getting on in years, his appearance slightly aged, but from his handsome facial features, one could still picture how stunning he looked during his prime.</p><p>The director brought in a pile of documents, carefully showed them to the elderly man, and respectfully offered them to him. “Mr. Mu, these are the children who came into the welfare center last year. All their information is here. Please have a look.”</p><p>The elderly man reached out his hand for the documents, went over some of them, and then furrowed his eyebrows. The assistant by his side caught sight of his expression and raised his head to smile at the director, asking, “That child is about eight to nine years old. May I ask, of those who were admitted last year, how many fit this condition?”</p><p>The director briefly went over his memories and swiftly replied, “Please hold on a moment.”</p><p>The elderly man continued to scan through the documents, yet his eyes were fixed on a family portrait. He suddenly stretched out his hand and pointed. “Let me see this girl.”</p><p>The director felt stunned before hurriedly nodding. “I understand! I shall arrange for her to meet you fast!”</p><p>He made a call and, soon after, a teacher brought a girl in.</p><p>Rou’er diligently stood in front of the elderly man, with her hands to her back and chest puffed up. Grinning from ear to ear, she said, “Grandpa, nice to meet you! I’m Rou’er.”</p><p>The elderly man expressionlessly stared at her and carefully examined every inch of her face. His eyes slowly narrowed as he looked at her darkly and gloomily.</p><p>Rou’er curiously wrinkled her brows. This elderly man’s fierce-looking face and stern demeanor somewhat frightened her. Just as she retreated a few steps, she saw him suddenly gesture to her.</p><p>“Come! Let grandpa take a good look at you!”</p><p>“… Okay.” Rou’er hesitantly took two steps forward. The elderly man gently held her shoulders and observed her up close. Despite the compatibility in age, he still felt that neither her appearance nor her facial features were similar to that person.</p><p>His vision slowly shifted downwards until it landed on the jade near her collarbone. The elderly man held up the piece of jade and softly asked, “This jade…”</p><p>Rou’er stiffened for a moment before smiling sweetly. “This jade was given to me by my mother.”</p><p>The elderly man slightly narrowed his eyes. His assistant quickly realized the situation. He hurriedly took out another piece of jade from a briefcase and passed it over to him.</p><p>The two pieces of jade were put together and they fit perfectly.</p><p>The elderly man’s hands slightly shuddered. Upon witnessing this, the assistant understood his intentions and walked over to the director. He muttered a few words to him before taking out a check with a large amount from the briefcase and handing it over to him. The director accepted it with a smile.</p><p>A row of luxurious, black limousines was parked at the entrance of the welfare center.</p><p>A desolate-looking girl climbed up the black iron railings in the distance and, with dull eyes, watched Rou’er follow a group of men in suits and enter an extended Bentley.</p><p>The moment the doors of the vehicle closed, Rou’er coldly swept her gaze over to her direction.</p><p>Coincidentally, their sight collided.

Your father was negligent in his business and went bankrupt. According to investigations, all information is correct. Your overall physical condition is proven fit by the medical tests, and there won’t be any issue regarding your custody rights.”</p><p>This girl was regrettably unable to meet the conditions for in-vitro fertilization. Then, they could only seek an alternative method.</p><p>Yun Shishi sat still on the bench. She gazed at the scenery outside the window. Her expression was strangely calm, yet deep within her watery eyes was complete darkness.</p><p>Although the young lady’s delicate features made her seem even younger, her tender face, as if she had experienced many vicissitudes of life, showed a look that was incompatible to her age.</p><p>She was the chosen one – the one in a million. Because of her aesthetically pleasing visuals, the remuneration provided by her employer was generous. The sum of five million dollars was already astronomical to her.</p><p>Three days ago, she secretly signed a contract without her father’s knowledge, and then she was brought over to this location. She was locked inside this room every day and was forbidden from contacting anyone outside and, even more so, from going out, as though she were a quarantined patient.</p><p>She knew that, in order to prepare her for pregnancy, they needed to ensure her health, so that her body would be better suited to carry the baby.</p><p>The three meals made for her a day were extremely exquisite. Ham, bacon, bread, beef – everything was almost too extravagant. She knew that those foods were beneficial to people preparing for pregnancy, so even though she did not like to eat them, she could only forcefully swallow them down.</p><p>Yun Shishi dared not disobey any orders, as absolute obedience was one of the conditions stated in the contract.</p><p>Thus, even today, she faithfully followed her employer’s secretary and anxiously came to this private institute to undergo medical examinations.</p><p>This employer of hers was very mysterious; she had not seen him even once. She only knew of the contract, and that signing it would entitle her to a remuneration of five million yuan. This amount should be enough to help her father overcome the financial crisis!</p><p>She did not dare to mention this matter to her father. When she left, she only left behind a note and did not say a word of goodbye. Because of the lengthy period of surrogacy, she would probably be unable to go back home anytime soon. Thus, she temporarily did not have to worry about facing her father’s apprehension.</p><p>According to one of the conditions in the contract, she needed to be put under close observation all the time until she conceived. When this condition was met, before the next day, one million dollars would be deposited in advance to her father’s bank account. She would be paid an extra sum if she bore a baby boy as mentioned by the secretary.</p><p>Surrogacy. Hah… It was laughable.

However, since it was a large sum, she could not help but be moved by it.</p><p>In financial straits, she chose this road looked down on.</p><p>By the sea.

In a luxurious bedroom, the curtains were tightly drawn and blocked all the lights.</p><p>Within the silent room, she took a bath and quietly lay down in the king-sized bed. She was requested to wear a blindfold. She lost her sense of sight, yet her sense of hearing was greatly enhanced.

He moved his body and slightly bent forward, leaning closer toward her.</p><p>Yun Shishi only felt his looming presence get nearer. Immediately, the imposing figure pressed down on her and completely imprisoned her under his body. Her body shook from the effort of withstanding his body weight. She curled up into a ball, and then she was no longer able to move. She nervously held her hands before her chest. She was nearly suffocating!</p><p>Not waiting for her to react, the man narrowed his eyes and pulled her clothes straight up. Her soft, milky white skin was exposed to the air. Suddenly, his large hands delved in—</p><p>“Wait!” she exclaimed with a trembling voice. “I… May I take a look at you?”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>His youthful yet deep voice was akin to red wine, rich and mellow. It was a husky voice that could draw people in.</p><p>“I can’t see anything… I’m scared….”</p><p>He scoffed and, with an extremely deep voice, said, “You don’t have to look and you don’t have to be scared.”</p><p>The girl’s delicate body had yet to develop fully.

It was as if her heartbeats were forcing themselves out from her throat.</p><p>Shame, panic, fear… With all these emotions weighing on her, she could hardly breathe.</p><p>It was in that moment that she started to regret her decision.</p><p>She initially thought that she could do it. It was just bearing a child for him, after all. She might have no experience, but, as a woman, this was something she would come across sooner or later. However, facing this unknown yet domineering man, she lost all the courage she had at the start. Right now, she only felt utter fear!</p><p>She had just become an adult and had not experienced any form of intimacy yet. She had never even held a boy’s hand in her entire life.

According to the contract, Yun Shishi was forbidden from going outdoors.

His wife even frequently mocked her of being an ungrateful and heartless b*tch in his face, as though she had run away from home with a random scumbag.</p><p>Their family was crumbling apart.

The Yun family was doing well at that time, and seeing that Yun Shishi was an intelligent and sensible child, he decided to adopt her.

He had a property on the market that generated stable profits, so they were considered to be living in wealth. However, at the start of the year, a financial storm suddenly swept across the globe, which left his entire family in shambles. The company was operating under a constant loss. Many shareholders had had their investments retracted. Seeing that the company was about to go bankrupt, his wife pointed her finger at Yun Shishi and blamed her for it. This was because, just the year before, he willingly spent the money originally set aside for investments to send her to a prestigious dormitory-based high school to study, to be away from this trifling home.</p><p>In his wife’s opinion, if it had not been for this particular move of his back then, the company would not have been affected by the economic crisis and the Yun family would not have fallen to such a state.</p><p>This matter caused many heated arguments in the household.

Only two months had passed, yet his entire hair was already a shade of grey, and the lines on his face were more prominent. He worried about her for many days. Settling the mountain of documents piled up at the company and searching for her in his free time, he split his attention to her and the company. He had been overworked.</p><p>“Dad, don’t fret about me. I’m quite alright,” Yun Shishi assured. She helped him sit down before asking, “How’s the company?”</p><p>“Did you deposit that sum of money?”</p><p>He went straight to the point.</p><p>Yun Shishi was stunned, unsure of how to answer him. She was flustered for a moment before quickly putting on a disguise. He held the back of her hand tightly. “Oh, child. Tell me the truth. Don’t lie to me.

Sitting up straight, he hurriedly asked, “Did you do something silly?!”</p><p>Seeing her head lowered and not say anything, he tried to find clues from her face, yet it was in vain.

She gave him all the love she had in her. This was to make him understand that even without a father, the amount of love he received could only be greater!</p><p>Hence, she gave him the name ‘Yun Tianyou’. While she thanked the heavens for blessing her with him, she also wished that he could grow up healthy.</p><p>As for Mu Yazhe, her father helped her conceal the truth from him. Her father had a pretty good relationship with the director of that hospital, and the man went against his professional ethics; helping them falsify the hospital records. Thus, Mu Yazhe remained unaware that the second baby had survived, and Youyou was able to stay with her instead of being taken away from her as well.

It was the toughest period of her life. She could not even sit through confinement properly. As she was accepted into a prestigious university, her workload was heavy. Whenever she was free, she had to catch up with overdue work. On a normal day, she had her part-time job while she took care of Youyou. Her body was on the verge of collapsing.</p><p>After graduating from university, she managed to land herself a high-paying job, hence the family’s financial situation improved. With her adoptive mother and sister staying at home while she was out working, she was afraid of Youyou being treated in the same way as her by them.</p><p>Back then, when she first brought Youyou home, Yun Na apathetically sneered at her.

Therefore, as soon as she got herself a job, she left the house with Youyou and rented an apartment for the both of them.</p><p>When she had to work, Youyou would be sent to a kindergarten, and he would wait for her at the entrance once he was dismissed.</p><p>She was glad that Youyou was a sensible child.

She noticed that his entire face was bright red, his eyes and brows drooping wearily. She squeezed her brows in worry. “What is it, Youyou? Are you unwell?”</p><p>Youyou’s eyebrows creased. He extended his hands toward her and said coyly, “Mommy, it’s hot… It’s hot! Youyou can’t walk anymore! Piggyback! Piggyback….”</p><p>Yun Shishi was stunned by his words and could not help but smile as she bent down. When Youyou saw this, his eyes curved happily. He stuck out his tongue playfully and leaped onto her shoulders. Yun Shishi held him firmly and stood up.</p><p>Satisfied, Youyou clung on to her shoulders, his small face pressing toward her. With an affectionate tone, he asked, “Mommy, are you tired?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“Wait till Youyou grows up, and then Youyou will be the one to carry mommy!”</p><p>Yun Shishi grinned, “Okay! Youyou is really mommy’s considerate little sweetheart!”</p><p>The little boy elevated his palm-sized face and asked with a blank look. “Mommy, what’s a little sweetheart?”</p><p>“It’s… a very heartwarming person – a person that makes people feel warm.”</p><p>“Oh! Then, Youyou will only be warm to mommy and no one else!” Youyou sweetly rounded his pink lips, cupped her face, and – <em>mwah! </em>– gave a smack on her lips.</p><p>The mother and son laughingly bumped each other’s heads and merrily left the area.</p><p>An extended Lincoln parked silently by the roadside.</p><p>The Lincoln had a pitch-black, streamlined body. From its window, a youthful yet cold, good-looking face could be seen.</p><p>The boy lazily lay on the genuine leather seat, a hand under his cheek. He looked to be about six, but his face had a mature and distant look that was incompatible with his age. He expressionlessly watched the joyous scene of Yun Shishi and Youyou through the window. Looking from under his thin bangs, something stirred inside him, and his vision came into focus.</p><p>The pair walked further and further away.</p><p>Inexplicably, a strange emotion emerged from the bottom of his heart as he glanced at the backs of the mother and son. It was something that could not be explained.</p><p>His heart slightly ached. It was bitter and a little sour.

He was the son of the chairman of a conglomerate, the chief executive officer of an empire, the Mu family’s Mu Yazhe, and, her fiancé.</p><p>They might not have held a wedding ceremony yet, but she was already the Mu family’s young mistress in name. Their future wedding would definitely be grand and magnificent; the greatest sensation of the century.</p><p>This man was also a sensation within the upper class of society.

Under the cool lights, his facial contour was prominent and his clean-cut features were a masterpiece. He had handsome brows and an attractive jaw. The best part of his face was his alluring, deep-set, almond-shaped eyes with pupils as dark as an obsidian, which could shake the heart and soul of many.</p><p>This was a handsome and mature man. His handsomeness was not just something on the surface; although his cold face looked young, he gave off the innate aura of an emperor, haughty and domineering, naturally perfect.</p><p>He appeared imposing with every move he made, just like emperors and overlords high above the masses in ancient times. With a wave of his hand, he could dictate everything.</p><p>Just by his presence, one would know that he was a man who had braved many storms – a man with a cold nature.</p><p>“Grandpa let me come to ask you.

No one was allowed to touch them. The two of them were just acting according to circumstances and were merely together for formality; he had no exceptions for other women.</p><p>Mu Wanrou was very angry.

If he loved her, then why would he not allow her to kiss him and not even say an “I love you” to her?</p><p>However, she loved him, with an almost servile manner, so she endured, gave in, and accepted all of him. He was noble, proud, and arrogant. He was the crown prince of the Mu Group. Despite her being deeply doted on by Grandpa Mu, this man was simply out of her reach.</p><p>Thus, she comforted herself, for who knew how many times. She told herself that she was the Mu family’s fiancée; she was, in the future, going to be the young mistress of the Mu family. In a few months, their engagement ceremony would be held, so she should not make a fuss. She should be satisfied with that. Unfortunately, she was greedy.

He brought her to Mu Yazhe and got them engaged. Mu was a rich and powerful family of great importance. And Mu Wanrou was all the more so, the apple of Grandpa Mu’s eye; she was noble and reserved. She loved Mu Yazhe, but he did not love her back.</p><p>This marriage, to him, a person born into a wealthy family, was unnecessary. He was just obeying his grandpa’s wishes.</p><p>Based on his personality, women were things that he could do without. They were not a necessity. Marriage was just something to keep his grandfather happy. It was a form of contract in disguise. His engagement with Mu Wanrou was no exception. It was just a bargaining chip. The collateral branches of the Mu family were slowly making their moves; many of them were eyeing his position. He was simply using this marriage as a springboard to expand the Mu Empire’s territory.</p><p>Love? This word was too much of a luxury to him.</p><p>What was love? Was it those socialites of the upper class fawning over him, chasing after fame and wealth? Was it the willful and arrogant Mu Wanrou?

His way of doing things was cold-hearted and firm. In private, one could negotiate deals with him, but they could never think of entering his heart.</p><p>Talking about love?</p><p>What a joke.</p><p>The phone on his table suddenly rang. Mu Wanrou answered the call for him and heard a voice message from the secretary desk. “Director, the young master has arrived.”</p><p>A series of footsteps was heard from beyond the door.

Realizing Mu Wanrou’s presence, a tinge of uneasiness spread on his face instantly. He called out to her flatly, “Mommy!”</p><p>Seeing this, Mu Wanrou felt somewhat uncomfortable. She did not know why she was not close to this little boy despite being his “mommy”. Perhaps, it was because he was not her flesh and blood.

Besides Mu Yazhe, he was quite distant to everyone else. He was like his father most of the time. They were truly cast from the same mould. His small face was always emotionless. He was taciturn and serious, just like an adult. It was as if he were not a child of his age. He was extremely mature.</p><p>When he was three or four, Mu Yazhe often accompanied him. He was just like a little devil; mischievous and always loved to prank. He often teased the maids in the Mu residence – totally a hedonistic little ancestor.</p><p>However, for the past two years, work at the Mu Group became more arduous, and Mu Yazhe was very busy and always away.

He sat on the sofa, his large hands patting his long legs lightly. When Little Yichen saw that, his eyes curved up and he ran toward his side.

Little Yichen grew up healthy under his care. However, he was not close to Mu Wanrou.</p><p>The child was innocent in nature, but he was spirited! Normally, at the Mu residence, Mu Wanrou would also dote on Little Yichen, even treating him as if he were her own.

It’s all because of you!”</p><p>Youyou’s face twisted to the side from the force of her slap. He slowly lowered his head and touched his cheek with his small hand. The strands of his bangs hid his eyes from view, thus except for his tightly pursed lips, his facial expression could not be seen.</p><p>Yun Shishi heard the commotion and rushed out of the kitchen. When she saw that Youyou had been hit, her anger was instantly provoked. With an aching heart, she dashed over to Youyou’s side and held him in her embrace. Looking up, her eyes were cold.</p><p>Witnessing this, her father was unable to suppress his rage. He stood up and rushed toward Li Qin. He lifted his palm at her but was stopped mid-action by a tug at the hem of his clothes. Stunned, he lowered his head.</p><p>It was only then that Youyou lifted his small face. With a half-swollen face, he formed an elegant smile. “Grandpa, stop fighting! Youyou learned something in school today; if a family lives in harmony, all affairs will prosper!”</p><p>Yun Yecheng’s hand halted mid-air. He hesitated for a moment before lowering it weakly. In his eyes, complicated emotions played. Li Qin was obviously scared by his anger, but, in the end, she saw him turn around to pour water for Youyou.</p><p>This child was so sensible that he gradually found having Li Qin for a wife as a misfortune to the family! He had thought of divorcing her but knew that the latter would make a scene. Moreover, it would be shameful if words got out around the neighborhood!</p><p>Yun Shishi cautiously observed the handprint on Youyou’s face. With fear lingering in her heart, she raised her head and stared intently at Li Qin. She then got up and pulled Youyou along to the kitchen.</p><p>This dinner affair was dismal just like the ones before.</p><p>After Yun Na came back, the mood became even more depressing. Yun Na had never liked Yun Shishi from the very start. This was understandable, though. Yun Yecheng and Li Qin had pampered her like a little princess and showered her with lots of love ever since she was young.</p><p>However, one day, another ‘daughter’ barged into their harmonious family of three, and she snatched away more than half of her father’s love. From then on, her father was no longer just hers. If there was anything good, he would not think of only her. If this were to happen to anyone, they would more or less be concerned as well.</p><p>Yun Shishi was perfect; she got good grades, was studious, and was patient with her. Because she was too good, her father loved Yun Shishi more. This was why Yun Na was unwilling to accept her and why she hated her so.</p><p>Back when Yun Na was undergoing her rebellious phase, she only felt jealousy toward and disdain for the ‘outsider’, Yun Shishi. Youyou needed not be mentioned, as she simply had no room for him! In her heart, he was just a bastard – born to a father but acknowledged by none!</p><p>Around the dining table, it was somewhat quiet.</p><p>From time to time, Youyou would pick up some food for Yun Yecheng, while Yun Shishi would share about interesting tidbits at work. The mood was then more relaxed.</p><p>Despite Li Qin and Yun Na not liking Youyou, they dared not be impudent or openly show it with Yun Yecheng around.</p><p>After dinner, Yun Yecheng received a phone call and had to head out. He reminded Yun Shishi of things and went off in a hurry.</p><p>Yun Shishi did not wish to stay long in this house, so she promptly cleared away the dishes and decided to wash them before leaving.</p><p>Youyou assisted his mother in washing the dishes by holding up bowls to her with his small hands. He was somewhat afraid of Li Qin and Yun Na, so after Yun Yecheng left, he stuck with Yun Shishi in the kitchen.</p></div></div>'),(254,11,'Chapter 20 Youyou is a little sweetheart',_binary '<p></p><p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 20: Youyou is a little sweetheart.</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Atlas Studios <i></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Atlas Studios</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>Youyou assisted his mother in washing the dishes by holding up bowls to her with his small hands. He was somewhat afraid of Li Qin and Yun Na, so after Yun Yecheng left, he stuck with Yun Shishi in the kitchen.</p><p>In the living room, Yun Na shifted her sight toward the mother-son pair in the kitchen with hatred. She whined to Li Qin, “Mom, why did you let that wretch into our family? Looking at her is so depressing! I lost my good mood!”</p><p>Li Qin sat on the sofa, her expression not looking good as well.</p><p>“Hmph! Who knows? You’ll have to ask your father that!”</p><p>“A wretch and a bastard. Why did our family encounter these two disasters?”</p><p>“Nana, don’t let your father hear that! Otherwise, he’s going to help the outsiders and scold us, mother and daughter! You haven’t seen your father’s expression today; it was really scary!”</p><p>When she heard about it, Yun Na’s face drained of color. “Dad actually helped them?!”</p><p>Regarding this, Li Qin was enraged. “He did!”</p><p>Yun Na clenched her fists tightly and snorted coldly. “He’s just a bastard! His father doesn’t want him, and we don’t even know which guy she fooled around with to have him.”</p><p>“Don’t learn from that woman, having a baby before marriage and at such a young age. If words of this get out, it’s really too shameful!”</p><p>Yun Shishi continued to wash the dishes with her head lowered, but her movement was now as rigid as a robot’s. Under the dim yellow light, her expression was strangely stiff. Although they were separated by a door, the two’s unpleasant words could still be heard clearly, and she found them unbearable!</p><p>The ridicules from the living room continued. Yun Shishi furiously let go of the dishes, but as she was about to confront the mother-daughter pair, a tender hand suddenly held her arm gently.</p><p>Startled, Yun Shishi lowered her head and saw Youyou snuggling up by her side. He was looking up at her with a smile. His pair of intelligent eyes seemed to penetrate through her complex emotions.</p><p>“Mommy, Youyou will help you wash the dishes so that we can go home fast!” After saying this, he tiptoed and struggled to reach into the sink with his two little hands. Yun Shishi was in a daze for a moment. She then pursed her lips and decided to rein in her anger once more.</p><p>Her anger nearly exploded for so many times today, but she had to hold it in each time.</p><p>They could target her. She could listen, she could endure, and she could bear. After all, she also knew that she owed the Yun family so much. If it were not for her father, she would not have such a good life. He gave her a home. Unfortunately, this home did not welcome her.</p><p>Even if she was despised again and again, she could tolerate it all. However, a human heart was ultimately made of flesh. Youyou did not do anything wrong to them! He was just an innocent child. He was still so young, and he should not relive the darkness she had gone through when she was young! If Youyou were not present, she certainly would flare up!</p><p>Youyou was by her side, however. As a mother, she wanted to leave Youyou with a lovely childhood.</p><p>Thus, she could only resolve not to step foot into the Yun family’s house ever again.</p><p>Inside a car heading back home, Yun Shishi weakly buried her face into the shoulder nook of Youyou, who was sitting on her lap, and grasped his little hand a little tightly.</p><p>She regretted it for a fleeting moment. She should not have been selfish to let Youyou stay by her side. Perhaps, by that man’s side, her son would have a father and a mother, and he would not have to bear with all this humiliation. At that man’s house, Youyou would live a much happier life, right?</p><p>However, she hated to part with him.</p><p>Six years of relationship. Blood was really thicker than water.

He really wanted to ask: Did his daddy really not like him – not want him – so he threw him away and did not bother with him anymore?</p><p>Was he really what those adults said? ‘Born to a father but acknowledged by none’?</p><p>These questions sprang to his lips, but he forcefully swallowed them back.</p><p>Youyou flipped his hand and held Yun Shishi’s delicate fingers. He lifted his small face and gazed up at the night sky, speaking softly, “Mommy, even if Youyou’s daddy doesn’t want Youyou, Youyou still has mommy! Youyou loves mommy the most, so don’t be sad! It’s all because of daddy that mommy is sad! When Youyou grows up, Youyou will definitely protect mommy!”</p><p>Yun Shishi raised her eyes, followed his line of sight, and gazed outside as well.

He felt rapid heartbeats inside.</p><p>His heart was in pain, and it was almost suffocating.</p><p>A maid, who was tidying up his toys, saw him place his hands over his chest, with his face contorting in pain.

His heart would suddenly beat rapidly and he would be in pain. However, every time he was sent to the hospital, no cause of pain was detected.

The elderly man donned a crease-free set of traditional Chinese garments. Despite his old age, he still looked energetic. Under the shadow of his brows, it was not difficult to realize that he was a charming and elegant man during his prime.</p><p>“Great grandpa…” Mu Yichen glanced up at him and called out meekly.</p><p>No one could shake Mu Sheng’s position in the Mu family. He had interacted with so many powerful figures throughout his life that his every word and gesture made people tremble in fear or be in awe.</p><p>Therefore, for a rich man’s son like Mu Yichen, he also feared his great grandfather.</p><p>Mu Sheng, for his part, doted on this little guy with all his heart and soul.</p><p>Mu Yazhe was his favorite grandson, and Mu Yichen was his flesh and blood, so it was natural that he doted on him more.</p><p>Seeing his beloved great grandson relapsing, his facial expression changed. He hurriedly inquired, “Is your body not feeling well again? Is your heart in pain again?”</p><p>His great grandfather showed concern for him, but Mu Yichen instinctively shied away from him. He was clearly afraid of him. He was afraid of Mu Sheng’s ever taciturn and stern face. Therefore, he never liked staying close to him. “Nothing!” He replied.</p><p>“Nonsense! Look at you! You’re in so much pain that you’re breaking out in cold sweat!” Mu Sheng was extremely heartbroken.</p><p>“Great grandpa, I – I will go upstairs to read books!” Mu Yichen leaped down from the sofa and dashed upstairs.</p><p>Mu Sheng looked at his great grandson’s back and slowly sighed.</p><p>The night deepened.</p><p>On the road, a black Bugatti Veyron raced with the wind.

Her reluctance did not stem from her having a backbone but, instead, from her being under financial strains as well. If she helped Yun Na pay off her debt, then she would not have enough to pay Youyou’s school fees for the next semester.</p><p>Watching her remain silent, the leader became enraged. He grabbed her by her shirt collar and tapped her face. “Are you a mute? Know how to speak? Speak up will ya?! Damn it!”</p><p>“Can’t pay up, can you?!” A few of the thugs shoved her around. Several pairs of eyes, harboring evil intentions, peeked at her chest. “It’s alright if you can’t pay up! You hafta behave and come with us! Got no money to pay?

He noted that one of her pair of slender legs was smeared with blood. The blood trickled along the delicate curves of her leg.</p><p>He scanned her entire body and saw no other injuries besides that slight skin abrasion on her knee.</p><p>Her injury was fortunately not severe, but she was still weeping in grief, as though she had suffered a really big grievance.

He had a habit of taking the car out for a ride in the mountains when he was feeling down. Just then, with his mind occupied, he had failed to notice her on the road. Perhaps, her frail frame and flimsy white dress made her inconspicuous as well. She looked so delicate, and he drove wildly on the road, so he failed to notice her until it was already too late. It was truly fortunate that nothing bad had happened to her.</p><p>Seeing her tears flow non-stop, Mu Yazhe wasted no more time. He lowered his head and fished out his wallet.

I’ve also made a glossary to help you keep track, since this is a long novel at 678 chapters and still ongoing.</p><p>Thanks, Rainbow Turtle.</p><p>Brief overview that I translated from a Korean site:</p><p>The basis of this novel is a virtual reality game called Satisfy, developed by the world’s top genius scientist Lim Cheolho and world-class scientists.</p><p>The main character is timid, flaky, selfish, cares about money and easily feels jealous of others. Because the author set up the character in this way, the story was difficult for the readers to read.</p><p>But as the main character encounters various people and geniuses, he internally matures and his personality changes. If the main character is described as cancerous early on, at present he can be called a mature adult. However, those who don’t read beyond the early parts of the 5th volume (~ chapter 90) find it hard to believe.</p><p>The basic settings and story line are similar to other VR novels, but the praiseworthy thing is the content development. The early parts aren’t much different from rival novels, but the novel rating has exceeded the market average in recent years due to the writer’s growth.</p><p>Like other novels, it contains a munchkin element, but it is different from typical munchkins. In the early stages, the game progresses with the main character using is class of a legendary blacksmith. The main character expands the game content and the level of the existing users dramatically increase. Hidden talents, new players in the official rankings, classes that could break the balance, all of this makes the main character’s one-man show impossible. The main character grows internally and externally while competing with others.</p><p>In fact, if you compare the simple and ignorant battle method in the beginning to his abilities in the present time, it is possible to feel such a sense of distance that he doesn’t seem like the same character.</p><p>As for the evaluation of the work, the criticism was severe in the beginning, but the popularity increased rapidly after that. As described above, the improvement in the author’s writing and the growth of the main character led to rapid changes in the comments. However, the main character’s selfish and frustrating behaviour caused many readers to stop reading in the beginning. For the readers who have gone beyond the beginning, it is a tragedy that seems really pitiful.</p><p>Currently, its popularity is increasing and a webtoon was recently released. However, there are many criticisms of the webtoon due to the various changes made. For those curious about the webtoon, here is the link to the raws, although only the first 3 chapters are free.</p><p>Prologue</p><p>“Five minutes left!”</p><p>Eight of the top-ranked players were gathered in one place on the 4th floor of Cork Island’s dungeon. The highest-ranked among them was Peak Sword, who was 16th on the overall unified rankings. Behind them were 200 elite members of the Silver Knights Guild.</p><p>It was a spectacular sight of a gathering of users with the combined power to capture a small fortress. But tension and anxiety filled everyone’s faces.</p><p>“Four minutes left!”</p><p>As time counted down, the nervousness of the guild members reached the peak. They were restlessly shaking their legs and biting their nails. Peak Sword gazed around with dark eyes, the hands holding his sword soaked with sweat.</p><p>‘I can’t calm down.’</p><p>Cork Island’s dungeon was fully controlled by the Silver Knights Guild, and the boss monster, Hell Gao, appeared on the 4th floor every two weeks. However, Hell Gao was stronger than expected and had a variety of patterns, so they had been unable to succeed in any of their five attempts so far.</p><p>Peak Sword and the elites of the Silver Knights strengthened their items with money during the last month, all with the intention of succeeding next time. They were definitely stronger after all the investments, but those who knew Hell Gao’s power couldn’t feel any confidence.</p><p>“Three minutes left!”</p><p>After three minutes, Hell Gao would appear and this place would turn into a sea of fire. Some of them would even die from just the flames.</p><p>“Two minutes left!”</p><p>A wave heat started to slowly permeate throughout the room.</p><p>‘Shit.’</p><p>Peak Sword wanted to encourage everyone, but he was afraid. He was clearly reminded of the overwhelming appearance of Hell Gao, the staff-wielding boss monster enshrouded in flames.</p><p>‘Are we still lacking the power to defeat him?’</p><p>It might be different if the power of the top 10 rankers were added, but he couldn’t help thinking that this expedition would fail with their current strength. However, the guild’s best ranker couldn’t show his weakness, so Peak Sword endured it.</p><p>‘Do it. We can do it. We are strong!’</p><p>Peak Sword steadied his heart and took various buffing potions, with the others following him. It was at that moment.</p><p>“One minute left…eh? Intruder! There is an intruder!!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>All of the guild members’ eyes headed towards the entrance. A young man had entered. It was unusual because he was covered by a cloak, with no armor or weapons visible.</p><p>‘Did he break through the defensive troops downstairs?’</p><p>Was it a highly trained assassin?  No, an assassin wouldn’t openly reveal their presence in a place like this. Peak Sword pondered on the name above the head of the black-haired youth. However, no matter how much he looked through his memory, it was an unfamiliar name.</p><p>‘He isn’t a ranker?’</p><p>Peak Sword glanced at his companions, but they all shook their heads.</p><p>‘A non-ranker coming all the way here. Pathetic.’</p><p>Peak Sword came to this conclusion and warned the youth with a frown,</p><p>“This is an area controlled by the Silver Knights Guild. I don’t know how you managed to reach this point, but if you don’t want to die, go back.”</p><p>“My stealth suddenly disappeared. Was it because I was detected by Hell Gao?”</p><p>The young man ignored Peak Sword’s warning and threw off his cloak as he talked to himself.</p><p>“Ohh!”</p><p>There were exclamations from every direction. The appearance of armor rapidly being equipped on the body of the youth was quite cool. Despite being made of metal, it seemed to be custom fit for the wearer, and its smooth surface was so reflective it was like a mirror. It was an elegant blend of red, black and gold. The particularly unique point was the one-meter long tail that stretched from the vicinity of the tail bone. It was sharp like a blade, and amazingly moving on its own.</p><p>“W-What, that armor?’</p><p>“It’s terrific… Unique grade?”</p><p>It was the first time they had seen such armor, so the guild members struggled to hide their interest. </p><p>Peak Sword raised his voice, “That isn’t important right now! Why aren’t you throwing him out right now?”</p><p>Hell Gao would soon appear and then nobody would be able to escape from the dungeon. They had to deal with the outsider before that. The moment that the guild members interested in the armor tried to carry out Peak Sword’s order,</p><p>Roaaaaar!!!</p><p></p><p>[Hell Gao, the owner of Hellfire, has appeared.]</p><p>[Hell Gao’s roar has applied fear, chaos, and debilitating effects.]</p><p>[Hell Gao’s fire reduces heat resistance by 50%.]</p><p>[Fire pillars have risen to cover you.]</p><p></p><p>“Kuack!”</p><p>“Hiiik!”</p><p>Due to the silent flames that surrounded the whole body, half of the guild members either fell into a dying state or burned to the point where they couldn’t even be recognized.  Barely half of the people standing were able to hang on. </p><p>Peak Sword was surprised at the notification window that popped up.</p><p>‘I raised my fire resistance to 86%, but to still receive this degree of damage…!’</p><p>They would fail again. As Peak Sword was feeling despair, he suddenly doubted his eyes. The unknown young man. While the others were surrounded by flames, he alone was moving forward, moving freely like he wasn’t affected.</p><p>“H-How…heok?”</p><p>Peak Sword fell silent as he witnessed a ridiculous scene. As Hell Gao ran amok and slaughtered the guild members, the young man pulled out a pickaxe, headed to the wall… and started swinging the pickaxe?</p><p>Kaaang! Kaaang!</p><p>The young man swung it with good form and complained as he wiped off the sweat,</p><p>“Ugh, hot! Isn’t the labor getting worse? Why does the mineral only appear when the boss mob is present? Based on this, I might have to visit a dragon’s lair with my pickaxe!”</p><p>At that moment, a hot wind emerged from the staff that Hell Gao waved and hit the young man. Peak Sword expected the young man to receive huge damage and collapse. But unbelievably, the young man only suffered minor injuries. </p><p>“Excuse me, Mister.” The youth stopped his pickaxe for the first time and turned his attention to Peak Sword. He said with an irate expression, “Why are you just standing there blankly? It’s hot now, but it will only just get hotter.”</p><p>What was he seeing now? Peak Sword belatedly regained his spirit and asked, “How can you be fine?”</p><p>The young man replied like it was obvious, “It’s the item effect.”</p><p>Chaaeng! Chaeng!</p><p>The tail on the young man’s armor moved by itself and fought against Hell Gao’s staff. Peak Sword couldn’t close his mouth as he gaped at the unbelievable sight.</p><p>Chapter 1 </p><p>After entering the ‘Northern End Cave’ at the end of a three months journey, I was able to witness the overwhelming sight of all types of battle gear piled up like a mountain.</p><p>“Wow, what is this?”</p><p>The names of the brilliant battle gear were in a colorful mix of green, yellow, and purple. If I took only a few of these, I would become a rich man! I wanted to take all the battle gear, but it was impossible.</p><p></p><p>[This item can’t be obtained.]</p><p></p><p>“How stingy and dirty.”</p><p>Items that couldn’t be acquired despite them being right in front of me! When I put it in my bag, it would return to its original spot like a mirage. This situation was like that of a pie in the sky, or a woman already being married.  No, a married woman was still different from a pie in the sky, as one could still obtain a married woman if one tried enough.</p><p>In the end, I could only stare at the items with longing and regret. </p><p>‘Indeed… If a user could obtain all of these, Satisfy’s economic balance might crumble. Unfortunately, I understand.’</p><p>I didn’t come here for the battle gear in the first place. I soothed my mind and turned my attention away from the pile of battle gear. There was an old book placed on a shiny gold table.</p><p>“Finally…”</p><p>All the hardships I experienced while coming here passed through my mind. Laughter emerged as my nose became runny and tears dripped down. Thank goodness I had patience and tenacity, otherwise, I would’ve quit the game because of the terrible difficulty of the quest. I felt great pride at the thought of clearing this quest. </p><p>“Kukuk…puhahahat!! I finally found it!! Oh, yehhhhhh!”</p><p>A damn S-grade quest that was impossible to give up!  Incidentally, how many deaths have I experienced before on this solo quest? How many items were destroyed due to no durability?!</p><p>A human blacksmith who transcended the skills of a dwarf, Pagma achieved the culmination of god-like techniques!</p><p>The face of Earl Ashur, who made me visit one of the Eternal Kingdom’s five forbidden zones, popped into my head.</p><p>“If I bring this to him, I can get the Sun Sword? Once I get it, no one can match me for the rest of my life, you bastards! I will make you pay for hitting me!”</p><p>Pleasure surged like a tide as I picked up the book.</p><p></p><p>[You have acquired the legendary craftsman’s rare book!]</p><p>[It isn’t in a proper state. You can check the details using the Eye of Pallalian.] </p><p>[Do you want to use the Eye of Pallalian?]</p><p></p><p>“Eye of Pallalian? A high-end appraisal item is needed to check the item?”</p><p>Eye of Pallalian was the most expensive among the existing appraisal items.  Six months ago, I had bought it just in case I got a jackpot, but sadly, I couldn’t use it and it was left in my inventory.</p><p>“I don’t want to miss a golden opportunity…”</p><p>I put the appraisal on hold and examined the golden table. I wondered if there was a way to take this gold away, but it wouldn’t budge. Kicking, pulling and even biting it was useless.  It was an item like the battle gear that users couldn’t own.</p><p>“Ah, I really can’t salvage anything because of this effective system. The price of my three months of work is very high.”</p><p>I gazed at the book in my hand.</p><p>‘I have to give Ashur the item so do I really need to use an expensive item to appraise it?’</p><p>I struggled for a moment before pulling out the Eye of Pallalian. It was natural to wonder about the source of my three months suffering.</p><p>“Appraisal.”</p><p></p><p>[Pagma’s Rare Book] </p><p>Rating: Legendary</p><p>This is a book that contains the techniques of Pagma, the blacksmith who transcended human limits. The person who opens the book can become a legendary blacksmith.</p><p>Effects: Become Pagma’s descendant.</p><p>Conditions: None.</p><p>* The level and stats will change when used. </p><p></p><p>[A legendary item has been found!]</p><p>[Reputation will rise by 500 across the continent.]</p><p></p><p>My body started trembling.</p><p>“Whoa…jackpot…”</p><p>It was a legendary item!  My reputation rose by 500 across the continent just because I discovered it!  It was an amazing harvest, given that it was difficult to raise reputation by 100 just in one city. </p><p>‘Reputation is reputation, but…’</p><p>I wondered if I had seen it wrongly and read the item description again. However, there was no change in the contents. </p><p>“Jack~~pot!!”</p><p>I wasn’t hallucinating.  I was extremely excited and could hear my heart beating wildly. I thought it was just a skill book but it was actually for a class change?  Furthermore, it was legendary grade! This meant it was the strongest class in the world!</p><p>“Moreover, there is no condition to use…”</p><p>Tears flowed down from my eyes. During the past year, I had to pay the interest on my loan, my Satisfy account, and I also took a leave of absence from school. My friends left me one by one, the alumni of my school laughed at me, people thought I was lazy…</p><p>My original plan was to sell the items I gained during the game and turn it into cash so that I could pay off my loan, my account, and my tuition. However, Satisfy wasn’t such a fair world.  It was hard to earn money and I could barely obtain equipment for myself, let alone ones I could sell.</p><p>But now it was different. A thrill went through my body as I shivered.</p><p>“It is over… I can say farewell to this nightmarish life!”</p><p>A legendary class change item! If I register it as an auction item on the item trading site, it was clear that the transaction price would be worth tens of millions of won.</p><p>No, it was an item that gave the best class among two billion users, so would it only be worth tens of millions of won? I could be sure that it was worth at least hundreds of millions of won. I might be able to get my hands on an astronomical amount that I never imagined!</p><p>“Puhahahahat!! Mother! Father! This freeloader finally made it! Now it’s time to leave the game and forget about finding employment! My parents can quit feeling ashamed of their son in front of the neighbors! Sehee! Oppa finally did it! Now you don’t have to be embarrassed every time you meet me on the street! When my friends want to come and play at my house, I don’t have to refuse and make all sorts of excuses! And my friends! Alumni! They can’t ignore me anymore as a pathetic game loser! I will become a success with a game! I have taken a few steps ahead of you guys in the society! Puhahahat!!”</p><p>I paid 10 million won to purchase a capsule, and my loan interest rose by hundreds of thousands of won every month.</p><p>‘Ahyoung is still pretty…’</p><p>I imagined attending my high school alumni meeting for the first time in two years in a foreign car. The successful alumni wouldn’t be able to ignore me anymore. Then I blushed as the face of my first love, Ahyoung, came to mind.</p><p>“Okay, go and sell it!”</p><p>Quest? I didn’t care about that right now. Obviously, while the reward was a weapon that belonged to the epic rating, it was nothing in comparison to the price of this book. My affinity with Earl Ashur would fall and would probably end up with me not receiving any more quests from him. But there was no reason to be afraid in front of hundreds of millions of won. </p><p>“Logout!”</p><p>I confidently exclaimed. Then a notification window flashed in front of my eyes.</p><p></p><p>[You can’t log out of the game here.]</p><p>[Earl Ashur has appeared.]</p><p></p><p>“……?”</p><p>Dozens of knights jumped into the cave as I was struggling to understand. Then the familiar Earl Ashur appeared. I panicked as he found me and his face distorted.</p><p>“Foolish traveler, you all have the same greed.”</p><p></p><p>[The quest ‘Earl Ashur’s Secret Request’ (S) has changed to ‘Earl Ashur’s Anger’ (SS).]</p><p></p><p>[Earl Ashur’s Anger] </p><p>Difficulty Level: SS</p><p>Earl Ashur chose you due to your average abilities, your stupidity and because you are easy to exploit. He entrusted you with the task of finding Pagma’s rare book that he wasn’t even sure existed. </p><p>He put a watcher on you and came urgently as soon as he heard that you entered the ‘Northern End Cave’.  Earl Ashur has witnessed you become blinded by greed over Pagma’s rare book and has no intention of forgiving you. He intends to kill you and take away Pagma’s rare book.</p><p>* Affinity with Earl Ashur has fallen by 100.</p><p>* Due to your actions, all of the fame you have built in Patrian has disappeared and you have now become infamous. The affinity of Patrian’s residents has fallen by 40. They will look at you and call you a thief.</p><p>Quest Clear Conditions: The deaths of Earl Ashur and his escort knights.</p><p>Clear Reward: Obtain the title ‘Noble Killer.’</p><p>* Noble Killer: Intelligence -50. </p><p>All nobles in the kingdom will despise and oppress you. Your jobs will be limited. The affinity of some commoners and royalty will rise.</p><p>Quest Failure: Level -2.</p><p>You will no longer be able to enter Patrian. </p><p>Any Patrian soldiers will kill you on sight.] </p><p></p><p>Patrian was the starter city where I first created my character. I built up a considerable amount of reputation while completing quests in Patrian from level 1 to the present, and my affinity with the residents was at its maximum.</p><p>All merchants gave me a 20% discount when buying goods, and the goods I sold were purchased at 15% above their value. There were residents who gave me hidden quests when I approached them. But all these achievements automatically flew away the moment this quest updated.</p><p>“…Ah, I. This is shit.”</p><p>A curse naturally emerged.</p><p>“Earl Ashur… no, you bastard! This goddamn bastard forced me onto a quest where I wasn’t sure if I could find the item or not!! If Pagma’s rare book was something that didn’t exist, I would’ve struggled for months in vain! You are the one who lied in the first place, yet you want to make me notorious in Patrian? Filthy jerk!”</p><p>As their master was cursed at, the hot-headed knights immediately pulled out their swords. Earl Ashur restrained them and spoke coldly to me,“You had already decided to betray me before you knew you were deceived. Even so, you are still acting so proudly.”</p><p>“Is it greedy to want a reasonable reward after the hardships of my journey? My betrayal wasn’t certain!”</p><p>He sneered at my words.</p><p>“Didn’t I already promise to give you a reward in return? We entered into a contract and you have trespassed on my good faith out of greed.”</p><p>This wasn’t something that I could handle with words. As I fell mute, Earl Ashur’s momentum increased as he continued to chatter,</p><p>“You are truly a poor man. The more I watched, the more I could feel it. But there are times when you can do extraordinary things, as I honestly hadn’t expected you to find this cave that had disappeared from history. I will punish you for your ignorance, but as reward for your patience, I will kill you as painlessly as possible.”</p>'),(261,12,'Chapter 2',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 2</p><p>‘This bastard!’</p><p>I wanted to stab my sword in Ashur’s mouth right now, but it was an impossible task. The man’s level was 300 and was also a great magician who completed his third class change. His escort knights had an average of level 180.</p><p>On the other hand, I was only at level 73 and didn’t even have a chance against the youngest knight who was serving as a bread shuttle. (Bread shuttle – Usually used at school, where one student is picked on and/or bullied to do the errands for people who are higher on the social ladder than the shuttles are.)</p><p>But look at the quest clear conditions. I had to kill them.</p><p>Plus!  Even if I cleared the quest, wasn’t the quest compensation garbage?</p><p>‘My intelligence will be minus 50? Fuck, right now I have 30 intelligence, so won’t I be an idiot if I’m at minus 50? And all of the kingdom’s nobles would hate me? So where was my exit route?? Why is there a quest like this? Ahhh!!’</p><p>There was only one choice. Just die. I would drop two levels, but I couldn’t succeed anyway. Besides, what was the point of succeeding with such a nasty quest?</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>I felt resigned. The pressure from the knights wasn’t a joke.</p><p>‘This means I would’ve lost eight levels just from this quest… Ashur… One day, I will become high level and take revenge. Definitely.’</p><p>I stared at Ashur and vowed revenge, then closed my eyes at the menacing swords in the knights’ hands. Then suddenly, I remembered Pagma’s book in my hand.</p><p>‘Wait, what about this?’</p><p>Would it remain in my inventory after I died if I put it in there before my death? This wasn’t a general quest item, so I couldn’t be assured of the situation.</p><p>What was Ashur’s purpose in the first place? Pagma’s rare book. The reason he wanted to kill me was to take it away. In order for the story to go smoothly, if he killed me, it was likely that Pagma’s book would disappear from my inventory and fall into his hands.</p><p>“Shit!”</p><p>If I was going to lose Pagma’s book anyway, I might as well use it instead of selling! A new option emerged. I could use Pagma’s rare book.</p><p>However, I hesitated. I hated production-related classes.  Wasn’t the point of a game to enjoy the thrill of battle? However, if I became a blacksmith, I would have to sweat as I hammered at iron in front of a fire. It might be necessary to carry pickaxes while searching for mines to collect the necessary materials. </p><p>It was indeed…</p><p>‘La. bor.’  </p><p>At that moment, a chill went down my spine. I was doing brickwork and shovel work at construction sites in real life, and now I needed to do labor in a game as well! Just imagining it made me feel terribly dizzy.</p><p>“Kuock…”</p><p>I wanted to remain as a warrior; it was my dream to swing my sword at enemies and someday become an army general. But now it was time to give up on that dream. An item worth hundreds of millions of won would be taken away by an NPC! By that bastard Ashur!</p><p>“It’s better to use it than to lose it to him!”</p><p>I tearfully opened Pagma’s book. The shocked Ashur hurriedly stretched out a hand and chanted a spell.</p><p>“It’s too late, you jerk.”</p><p>I ridiculed him before falling silent as I checked the notification windows appearing one by one.</p><p></p><p>[You have become Pagma’s descendant.]</p><p>[Your level has dropped.]</p><p>[You are now level 1.]</p><p>[All skills and stats have been reset.]</p><p></p><p>“……?”</p><p>I couldn’t believe my eyes. Weren’t class changes supposed to help you get stronger by strengthening your existing level, stats, and skills?

Hahaha…”</p><p>I could’ve gone and taken some labor jobs, but I ended up shoveling air.  No, it was a loss of time and level. I lost energy and flopped to the ground. I was sad, empty, grumpy, and resentful.  All types of negative emotions were pouring in, giving me a tremendous sense of helplessness. If I were weaker person, I was sure that I would’ve committed suicide.</p><p>“…I need to take a shit.”</p><p>I had been connected to the game for a long time, so I headed to the bathroom after receiving a physiological signal. It was three in the morning. All my family members were sleeping. If I woke up my parents then they might curse at me. </p><p>I stealthily crossed the living room, quietly did my business in the bathroom, washed up, moved back to the kitchen, and took out a side dish from the fridge. I barely managed to find a spoon in the darkness and returned to my room with a bowl of rice.</p><p>“Oh, it’s sausage fried rice.”</p><p>The taste of a meat processed product!

The number of comments was more than 2,000!</p><p>“D-Don’t tell me?”</p><p>I couldn’t find the information, but was the minus level actually famous among users, and the users were excited because it gave tremendous benefits?

There was no such thing as a customer service center like in other more traditional online games. Satisfy’s two billion users had been developing the world during the past year by pioneering and exchanging information on their own. </p><p>But in such a vast world, there was a lot of information that hadn’t been revealed, such as the minus level that I was experiencing now.</p><p>Swaaah.</p><p>It was raining outside the window.

He  was the head of Satisfy’s development team, as well as head of the S.A  Group, so he slept less than four hours a day on average. But was he unhappy? No, it was something he wanted for himself. Lim Cheolho was proud and enthusiastic about Satisfy, which had captured the hearts of two billion people.</p><p>“Umm.”</p><p>Lim Cheolho was woken up by the sound of his phone ringing. He checked the time and saw that it was 2:50 a.m. It had only been 20 minutes since he went to sleep. The accumulated fatigue from a month’s worth of late nights crushed Lim Cheolho’s thinking ability. </p><p>His voice was rather sharp as he spoke into the phone, \"What is going on? What?”</p><p>An urgent voice was heard over the phone. Lim Cheolho immediately woke up. “I’m going immediately! Be prepared to give me the report as soon as I arrive!”</p><p>Lim Cheolho got dressed and entered the elevator, heading to the underground floor of his house. In the underground parking lot, limited edition cars from expensive brands were parked in order by type. He climbed into a sports car with the butterfly style doors and drove to the company at full speed.</p><p>\"What happened?”</p><p>Satisfy’s Operations Office.</p><p>Lim Cheolho ran into it and asked without recovering his breathing. Yoon Nahee, the head of the operations team, bowed to Lim Cheolho and adjusted her orange horn-rimmed glasses.</p><p>\"It happened five minutes ago.”</p><p>“How interesting!”</p><p>The excited Lim Cheolho sat down. He turned his gaze to the huge monitor on the wall and the stopped video started playing. The main character of the video was a level 73 warrior. An Asian youth found a cave at the northern end of an island, held Pagma’s rare book, and used it.</p><p>The staff handed two documents to Lim Cheolho as he watched the video. Lim Cheolho read it and rubbed his chin.</p><p>“In  reality, as well as in Satisfy, he is a normal person with no  outstanding traits. After being exposed to Satisfy, he suffered from a  lack of self-control, resulting in the lowest level of life. How did  this person find the cave at the north end that was concealed by a  complex algorithm? Does he have an exploration talent that he doesn’t  know about?”</p><p>According to the analysis from  the development team’s ‘Morpheus’ supercomputer, the North End Cave was  supposed to be found by users in one year and ten months. In  other words, it meant that the appearance of the legendary book,  ‘Pagma’s Rare Book’, was originally supposed to be one year and ten  months later.</p><p>One young man broke everyone’s expectations and hastened the timing. The number of users who did their 2nd class advancement was less than 100, and he was now the sole legendary class in the game.</p><p>Lim Cheolho was greatly interested in the user who gave him a great surprise. But Yoon Nahee didn’t think of the young man as anything special.</p><p>\"It was merely a product of coincidence and obsession that he discovered the North End Cave.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>The  young man called Shin Youngwoo, whose player name was Grid, stayed in  only one city for a year and accumulated more than 8,000 reputation in  that city. His intelligence stat was also less than 50. </p><p>This completed the conditions needed to receive Earl Ashur’s quest. He  explored areas infested with monsters higher than level 200 for three  months without giving up, even though he was less than level 80 and  tasted death several times.</p><p>The most impressive thing about him was his discovery the North End Cave. He  found the quest item and was blinded by greed. By choosing to log out,  he met the requirements for the linked quest to possess the legendary  book. </p><p>‘There are many ways to meet the activation requirements, but the most extreme one is logging out.’</p><p>Anyway, as Yoon Nahee said, this chain was the result of coincidence and a stubborn personality. However,  the young man proved that coincidences overlapping several times could  create a positive cloud. It also reminded him how valuable patience and  effort was.</p><p>‘Luck and persistent are also great abilities.’</p><p>Yoon Nahee asked a question to Lim Cheolho, who was watching the young man on the monitor with sparkling eyes.</p><p>\"How does the minus level work?”</p><p>\"That is also a cloud of luck.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>A scientist was talking about luck? Lim Cheolho laughed and explained,</p><p>“As  you know, users below level 10 get the beginner bonus, so their  experience won’t decrease even if they die. This means that they don’t  suffer from the level drop phenomenon. But in fact, a hidden system  exists. Level reduction due to quest failure will be enforced regardless  of the beginner benefits. However, there is no way for a beginner to  receive a quest that would cause a level decrease, so it was likely to  remain a hidden system forever.”</p><p>Lim Cheolho enjoyed the fragrance of the coffee that a staff member passed him and continued,</p><p>“The  team predicted that if this quest followed the normal course, the one  who received ‘Earl Ashur’s Secret Request’ quest would be a minimum of  level 350. If the user is over level 350, they have a high chance of  clearing the ‘Earl Ashur’s Anger’ quest and becoming Pagma’s Descendant.  In other words, they wouldn’t be lacking in ability like that young man  and wouldn’t have failed the quest. Only this young man was able to  find the hidden system through this quest.”</p><p>Yoon Nahee summarized it succinctly.</p><p>Grid  made an extreme choice during the quest because he was afraid of losing  the hard-earned item. At this point, the penalty of falling to level 1  after becoming a legendary class was applied. </p><p>Users  under level 10 wouldn’t experience a drop in experience even if they  died, due to the beginner bonus. But there were no exceptions to a  failed quest’s penalty. Grid was forced to lose  two levels due to the quest failure, even though he was level 1, and as a  result, he was now stuck at level -1.</p><p>This was why Lim Cheolho called it a cloud of luck...</p><p>“Then can a minus level gain experience in the normal way and earn stat points for every level gained?”</p><p>Lim Cheolho nodded. “Right. He is currently level -1 and will have to gain two levels to reach level 1, where he will then have 20 stat points.”</p><p>\"...This means his base stats will be 20 points higher than a character of the same level.”</p><p>\"That’s  right. That young man received a benefit that wouldn’t have been  possible if he was a player capable of clearing Earl Ashur’s quest. He  is a really lucky guy.”</p><p>The expressions of the employees grew serious. Yoon Nahee asked him, “A  legendary class has appeared two years sooner than expected. A  legendary class is already very powerful, so if he has 20 more stat  points than his level, won’t the balance be broken?”</p><p>Lim Cheolho showed her the papers listing Shin Youngwoo’s information.</p><p>\"This  graph shows that his level was quite low in proportion to the amount of  time he spent hunting. He was a foolish person who stayed in one city  for a year without leaving to find adventures or a more pleasant  environment. I don’t think he has great talent for the game like the  rankers. You don’t have to worry.” </p><p>\"Is it really okay? In the eyes of other users, it might be enough to make him look special.”</p><p>\"What  can we do, even if it isn’t okay? We have a policy of not directly  interfering in the game, so think positively. Isn’t it a good thing that  an ordinary user, not a ranker, obtained it? Besides, Pagma’s  Descendant is relatively weak in combat compared to the other legendary  classes...”</p><p>Lim Cheolho, who was watching the young man on the monitor, suddenly flinched and fell silent. He shook his head at Yoon Nahee’s puzzled expression.</p><p>“No,  it isn’t a big deal. I will be going now. You have suffered a lot from  the late nights of work. I will give you a bonus soon, so please suffer a  bit more.”</p><p>The atmosphere of the employees became excited at the word ‘bonus’. Lim Cheolho smiled and left the office.</p><p>‘Why all of a sudden?’</p><p>Only Yoon Nahee was silent among the raucous staff. She felt nervous as she thought about Lim Cheolho’s surprised look. On the other hand, Lim Cheolho’s expression subtly changed in the elevator as he muttered Shin Youngwoo’s name.</p><p>***</p><p>I  lost my place of residence because I was expelled from Patrian.  Therefore, I resurrected at a temple near my place of death. Oh and by  the way, it was actually a temple for the god of darkness, Yatan.</p><p>Dark energy hung around the dark room, while robed black magicians wandered around with gloomy expressions. People were shouting and pounding their chests around an altar, but it was too creepy to watch. </p><p><em>Kiyaaaaak!</em></p><p>The sharp scream of a woman in pain came from underground.</p><p>\"...Well, it is nothing compared to that notorious place.”</p><p>I  had already finished my military service. If someone had been next to  me, then they would’ve felt the general, oppressive atmosphere of a  horror movie. I wasn’t a female user so I felt no fear at the Yatan Temple.</p><p>“S-S-Status window.”</p><p>My voice was shaking but I tried not to let it affect me. I ignored the surroundings as much as possible and concentrated on the status window in front of me.</p><p>Name: Grid </p><p>Level: -1 (0/20)</p><p>Class: Pagma’s Descendant</p><p>* The probability of adding additional options when making items will increase.</p><p>* The probability of item enhancement will increase. </p><p>* All equipment items can be worn unconditionally.

However, the special functions given by the title and profession  overwhelmed me.</p>'),(263,12,'Chapter 4',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 4</p><p>‘The minus level isn’t a bug.’</p><p>The numbers in parentheses beside the level indicated my current experience and the amount of experience required to reach the next level. The existence of this experience figure meant that I could level up. In the worst case, I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to level up because I was bugged.</p><p>‘I’m glad it isn’t a bug…’ </p><p>I still felt upset. Think about it: my level was originally over 70, but now I was lower than even new players who had just created their characters.</p><p>‘I have to endure this.’</p><p>I braced myself. It might take time, but I could raise my level again. The reason for this positive thinking was due to the qualities of my profession and title. I didn’t know anything about item creation, so I couldn’t comment on the probability of adding additional options, but it was still good to have.</p><p>‘The odds of enhancement will increase.’</p><p>In Satisfy, items could be enhanced up to +10. </p><p>However, the price of the materials needed for enhancement was expensive. In addition, the higher the enhancement number and item rating, the lower the probability of the enhancement succeeding. In addition, if the enhancement was successful, the enhancement value would be +1; however, if it failed, it would be -3. The price for items with an enhancement of +6 would rise exponentially.</p><p>‘I don’t know how much the probability has risen, but can’t I feel hope for a large amount of money?’</p><p>Both of the class characteristics that I mentioned were quite attractive. However, my bigger interest was that all items could be worn unconditionally. This was an unreasonable merit. Depending on the penalties that were applied, this attribute could disrupt the balance of the game.</p><p>’Isn’t this a fraudulent class attribute?’</p><p>Most of the equipment items in Satisfy had conditions of use attached to them. If the conditions weren’t met, the item couldn’t be worn. For that reason, every level had strong limitations. But that didn’t apply to me, due to the nature of my class.</p><p>‘Really?’</p><p>I opened my inventory.</p><p></p><p>[Mamon’s Greatsword] </p><p>Rating: Epic</p><p>Durability: 88/204   Attack Power: 178~301   Attack Speed: -16%</p><p>-Additional water damage will be added to all critical attacks.</p><p>This is the greatsword patronized by the guardian of Lake Pamian, Mamon.

I recalled a set of beginner items that were representative of having no conditions. I didn’t remember it exactly, but in the case of the beginner’s greatsword received at level 1, the attack power was 5~13 and the defense of the beginner’s armor was 7.</p><p>But now I could use a weapon capable of at least 124 to 210 attack power, and 132 defense at level one.</p><p>‘Won’t it be surprisingly easy to recover my level?’</p><p>No matter how low my level was, I could hunt monsters around level 20 with just the attack power of Mamon’s Greatsword. Thanks to Mengel’s Plate Armor, I wouldn’t receive any damage from low-level monsters.</p><p>In other words, I could hunt monsters much more quickly and easily than other users at the same level, thanks to the item effect. This would be directly linked to leveling up at the speed of light.</p><p>‘The basic penalties system is that rare items have a drop of 20% in the basic abilities, while epic items have a 30% drop. Only half of the item effects are applied…’ </p><p>The penalties were surprisingly small. Unique and legendary ranked items would be subjected to more penalties, but at this point, it was a sufficiently fraudulent ability. </p><p>“This is a legendary class…! But what is understanding?”</p><p>Due to my excitement, I belatedly noticed the bit about ‘understanding’ that appeared in the notification windows. Then I checked the detailed information.</p><p></p><p>[Item Understanding]</p><p>Pagma’s Descendant can understand the materials and principles of the item by using, disassembling, or repairing the equipment items. The higher the level of understanding, the more efficiently one can handle the items. If you have a 100% understanding, you can learn how to make that item. </p><p></p><p>“Ohu~”</p><p>The higher my level of understanding, the fewer penalties there would be.</p><p>“Then I will get the production method? Wow…”</p><p>Ordinary production users had to pay a large amount of money or complete hard questions to get the production methods. But I could get it for free, as long as I increased my understanding.</p><p>‘The repair skill is available and my item durability is low, so I will try and repair it later.’</p><p>Then I looked at the title attributes. In combat, the one thing players had to be most cautious of was an abnormal status, due to its ability to often reverse the state of a battle. By the way, my title lowered the probability of being affected by abnormal statuses. It also said that I wouldn’t die when my health was at the minimum, so I could be temporarily immortal.</p><p>‘Easily acknowledged, does that mean my affinity with NPCs can be easily increased?’</p><p>“Puhuhut…”</p><p>I was happy. I was so happy that I couldn’t stop laughing. The class and title attributes alone gave me the feeling of being ahead of other regular users. I had become special. This felt like proper compensation for my three months of suffering.</p><p>“But…”</p><p>I would’ve enjoyed a much greater pleasure if I could’ve sold the book for money.</p><p>“I missed out on the opportunity to get rid of my creditors and to drive a foreign car!”</p><p>I suddenly went from feeling good to feeling bad.</p><p>“~#@….!^%*@…. Ashur!!”</p><p>I pounded the floor with frustration and resentment. I poured all out types of profanities towards Ashur. Gradually, my heart was soothed. It was due to an unfamiliar stat, so I decided to check it.</p><p></p><p>[Composure]</p><p>The probability of being affected by an abnormal state is lowered.

The moment that I was about to open the skills window.</p><p>“Aack!”</p><p>I screamed with fear. Something had suddenly touched my back. I belatedly recalled that I was in a Yatan Temple.</p><p>“W-What!!!”</p><p>I hurriedly turned around and reflexively wielded Mamon’s Greatsword. The man behind me dodged my attack and raised both hands.</p><p>“Hey, calm down. Do you want to kill a person?”</p><p>The one who spoke was a Caucasian-looking man who seemed to have an assassin type class due to his light equipment and agile body. </p><p>‘His finger poked my back.’</p><p>It might’ve be okay if it was a sword, but it was embarrassing to scream just because of a finger.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>The man shrugged.</p><p>“It is dreary. Shouldn’t you apologize after trying to kill a person?”</p><p>His smile looked like a smirk. I disliked this type of person.</p><p>‘This person is speaking so impolitely at our first meeting.’</p><p>Certainly, the man looked older than me. At first glance, he seemed to be in his mid-30s. However, my one year experience was enough to let me know how deceptive appearances were. I once called someone ‘Brother’, only to find out they were seven years older than me. </p><p>This bastard, he looked like he was in his 30s but…</p><p>“Cough.” My fists trembled and I barely managed to calm myself as I remembered the shameful past. “I’m sorry about that. But shouldn’t you apologize for poking me without notice and surprising me?”</p><p>The man laughed and asked for a handshake.</p><p>“Young man, I called out to you. However, you were so engrossed in thinking that you didn’t hear me. That is why I poked you. I’m sorry.”</p><p>I refused to shake hands with the man.</p><p>“So why did you call me?”</p><p>The man scratched his head and shrugged.</p><p>“As you know, the Yatan Temple is filled with evil energy. Ordinary people will become afraid if they stay here for a while. But I observed you, and you are fine despite all the time that passed. In addition, you can even manage to laugh alone. You, don’t you actually have great abilities?”</p><p>‘Perhaps this is…’</p><p>As I got a hunch, I checked the name above the man’s head. The man’s eyes shone.</p><p>“My name is Doran. I am a shadow who secretly protects Earl Steim. One or two days after I had gone on vacation, the Earl’s esteemed daughter was kidnapped. I tracked her and found out that she was trapped in the basement of this temple. Won’t you lend me your strength? I will give you a remuneration for the request.”</p><p>“I don’t…”</p><p>I thought the man was a user, but he was actually an NPC. Due to the perfect artificial intelligence, the distinction between users and NPCs was ambiguous and this mistake sometimes occurred. The name above his head was green, symbolizing an NPC. Then a notification window about a quest popped up.</p><p></p><p>[Rescue the Earl’s Esteemed Daughter] </p><p>Difficulty: S</p><p>Irene, the only daughter of Earl Steim, is a beautiful and innocent virgin.

But the great thing was the title of ‘Earl’s Son-in-Law’. </p><p>All stats +20!  I currently had nine stats in total: strength, stamina, agility, intelligence, dexterity, composure, indomitable, dignity and insight. If I added the nobility stat, that would equal 10 in total. </p><p>If all of these stats were given 20 points, it would be a total of 200 stat points. Every time I gained a level, 10 stat points were obtained, so 200 stat points were worth 20 levels.

It was an S grade quest! </p><p>‘Earl Ashur’s Fury was an S grade quest. ’</p><p>At the time of the quest, I was level 79 but couldn’t cope with the difficulty. I was killed many times during the quest and dropped down to level 73.

Why would I accept a quest that would obviously fail? </p><p>‘Furthermore, my level will fall by two if I fail.’ </p><p>My body trembled with fear and anger at the thought of my level dropping to -3. </p><p>‘But why on earth is it an S grade quest again?’ </p><p>S grade quests were never common quests. Even the top level rankers who were above level 200 could only count the number of times that they’ve received an S grade quest on their left hands.  However, I wasn’t high level user and was currently at level -1. </p><p>I recalled what Doran said: </p><p>‘As you know, the Yatan Temple is filled with evil energy.

The quest seemed to be generated by staying in the Yatan Temple for a certain period of time without falling into the ‘fear’ state. My title and composure stat lowered my chances of falling under an abnormal condition. </p><p>Was it good? Did I like it? </p><p>‘Won’t I be screwed if this is a forced quest?

Did it think I was in a position to take care of others right now?  I immediately swiped the window away and said, “You are mistaken. I am weak and incompetent, so I won’t be able to help you. It would be better for you to take care of it alone.” </p><p></p><p>[The quest was refused.] </p><p></p><p>“As you know, the believers of Yatan use powerful black magic! I can’t rescue the young lady from them alone! Please don’t turn away, lend me your strength!” </p><p></p><p>[Doran hasn’t given up. Would you like to accept the quest?) </p><p></p><p>“No, first of all, I don’t have the ability to do it…” </p><p></p><p>[The quest was refused.] </p><p></p><p>“You are too modest! Don’t you know that the power to ignore their fear isn’t common?” </p><p></p><p>[Doran can only depend on you. Would you like to accept the quest?] </p><p></p><p>Sometimes, there were quest NPCs who would persist like this. They had their own desperate situations. Yes, I could understand Doran’s feelings. If Doran returned without rescuing his master’s daughter, his head would go flying off. </p><p>But what about me? What if I failed and my level dropped again? </p><p>Why should I go through such terrible things because of him? I was more important than a complete stranger! The biggest problem was that I didn’t have the ability to help him in the first place. </p><p>“Please help! I am begging you!” </p><p>Doran fell to his knees. </p><p>I looked at him.  This man, all the words I spoke to him were entering one ear and leaving the other. Or maybe he thought I was lying. </p><p>‘It’s probably the latter. Is it so great that I don’t feel fear while staying in the Yatan Temple? I haven’t been here before so I don’t even know what I’m supposed to feel.’ </p><p>I faced Doran head on and explained with a more serious attitude,</p><p>“I’m really sorry, but I truly don’t have the strength to help you. Don’t waste your time on me; call the earl and ask for his help.” </p><p></p><p>[The quest was refused.] </p><p></p><p>“Every hour is urgent! The young lady’s life might be in danger while I go to ask the earl for help! You are the only person I can rely on! This is a request!” </p><p></p><p>[Doran is hoping for a helping hand. Would you like to accept the quest?] </p><p></p><p>The limits of patience. </p><p>“Ah, this is frustrating! Do you really need my help? I don’t want to look at you anymore, so go away!” </p><p>“Please give mercy for the sake of her life!” </p><p>“What? No! Damn. Yes, I should leave. I am going now!” </p><p>I once again refused the quest and turned away from Doran. This was a terrible quest that would cause my level to drop by two upon failure, so I wanted to avoid it. But unlike my thoughts, my feet didn’t move quickly. I was 200% over the weight limit, so my movement speed was reduced by 100%. </p><p>Doran saw that I was moving as slow as a turtle and misunderstood my actions as he teared up. </p><p>“You act so intimidatingly, but you are actually conflicted… You really do want to help me…” </p><p>“……” </p><p>“Stop feeling conflicted and help me!” </p><p></p><p>[Doran feels hope again. Would you like to accept the quest?] </p><p></p><p>“Bullshit! I won’t help!” </p><p></p><p>[The quest was refused.] </p><p></p><p>I ignored him and hastened my steps. But once again, my speed was slow. This only deepened Doran’s misunderstanding. </p><p>“Maybe you’re conflicted because your life is busy, but the life of a person is more important! This is a request!!” </p><p>“I can’t! It isn’t possible!” </p><p>“Don’t deceive yourself! In fact, you are suffering as well! You can’t leave this place immediately, which is why there is such hesitation in your step!” </p><p>“There is no hesitation! I’m not walking slowly! My baggage is heavy, that’s all!” </p><p>Doran continued chasing after me, and my slow pace couldn’t get rid of him. </p><p></p><p>[Would you like to accept the quest?] </p><p>[Would you like to accept the quest?] </p><p>[Would you like…] </p><p></p><p>‘What a stupid jerk!’ </p><p>The notification windows kept popping up no matter how much I refused. I had to make a drastic decision. </p><p>‘I can’t carry on like this. Yes, I have to refuse, even if I develop a hostile relationship with him. He isn’t a NPC I need to build up a relationship with, so it won’t hurt if he is my enemy.’ </p><p>I pulled out Mamon’s greatsword and glared at Doran. </p><p>“I definitely can’t help you. If you don’t get away right now, I am prepared to hurt you.” </p><p>Doran grasped the atmosphere and took one step back. Then he slowly opened his mouth. </p><p>“I really wish you would help me…” </p><p></p><p>[Doran is asking for the last time. Would you like to accept the quest?] </p><p></p><p>Swipe! </p><p>How many times do I have to see this damn notification window? </p><p>“I won’t help! Even if I can help, I don’t want to! I won’t help!” </p><p>My stress went over the threshold and I could no longer suppress my anger. In the end, I yelled and swung Mamon’s greatsword, expressing my intent not to talk to Doran anymore. </p><p>Then… </p><p>Kwajak! </p><p>“Kaaack!” </p><p>The sensation of hitting something was transmitted through my fingertips as a scream was heard at the same time. I turned my gaze to the side of the greatsword and saw what just occurred: a believer wearing the robe of Yatan had collapsed with Mamon’s greatsword in his neck. An ominous chill went down my spine. </p><p>“I was aiming at the crazy guy, so why did the person next to him…” </p><p>As I stared at the dying believer, a new notification window popped up. </p><p></p><p>[Your relationship with the Yatan Church has become hostile.] </p><p>[You won’t be able to receive Yatan’s blessings.] </p><p>[The followers of Yatan will try to kill you when they find you.] </p><p></p><p>The atmosphere of the temple changed. While I was surrounded by dozens of Yatan believers, Doran got up and placed a hand on my shoulder and cried out, “Thank you!!” </p><p>“Eh?” </p><p></p><p>[Rescue the Earl’s Esteemed Daughter] </p><p>Difficulty: S </p><p>Irene, the only daughter of Earl Steim, is a beautiful and innocent virgin. The elders of Yatan had kidnapped Irene in order to sacrifice her for her virgin blood. </p><p>You can’t tolerate the evil deeds of Yatan’s followers. You must surely rescue Irene.</p><p>Quest Clear Conditions: Rescue Irene within one hour after accepting the quest. </p><p>Clear Reward: 3,000 gold, a low probability of becoming the earl’s son-in-law. </p><p>* Earl’s son-in-law: Nobility stat will open, all stats +20. </p><p>You will be treated as a viscount after marrying the earl’s esteemed daughter. Power and honor will rise. You can advance into the social circle of the nobles. You will receive a monthly salary. This can be a shortcut to becoming a high-ranking official or lord. </p><p>Quest Failure: Level -2. </p><p></p><p>[The quest has been accepted.] </p><p></p><p>“Wow.” </p><p>Due to my hostile relationship with the Yatan Church, the ‘Rescue the Earl’s Esteemed Daughter’ quest was forced upon me. </p><p>“Huhuhu…” </p><p>Some might say this was unlucky. No, it was more accurate to say that I had no luck. </p><p>‘Failure once again… it will be level -3!’ </p><p>At any rate, I had no luck. Perhaps I sold a country in my previous life.</p><p>“Who dares hurt Yatan’s believers! Aren’t you afraid of the curse of God Yatan?”</p><p>“God Yatan is almighty! God Yatan has already noticed your sin! You won’t be safe for the rest of your life!”</p><p>“You will pay a heavy price for your blasphemy!”</p><p>The angry voices of the Yatan followers clamored around me. Their crazy eyes were filled with absolute hostility.</p><p>‘Will I die now?’</p><p>The followers of Yatan were black magicians. Black magicians had strong curse abilities, so they were difficult to deal with.  				</p>'),(265,12,'Chapter 6',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 6</p><p>‘The black magicians are the problem right now…’ </p><p>I was currently level -1, and my strength and stamina stats were only one point each. Mengel’s Plate Armour added five strength, for a total of six strength. When all of these stats were added up together, I totalled a measly 34 health. I might be able to punch a few of them before going to the netherworld.</p><p>‘Can I get away?</p><p>The failure of the quest was fixed anyway. I just wanted to preserve my life. No, I had to survive. If someone died two times in a day, they wouldn’t be able to access the game for 12 hours. Okay, this was the only way!</p><p>“Log out!”</p><p></p><p>[You can’t log out of the game here.]</p><p></p><p>“Fuck! I should’ve expected this!”</p><p>It was common knowledge that it was impossible to end the game while a timed quest was underway. There was a way to force it, but I didn’t want to use it since I would get a huge penalty. After failing to log out, I looked for a way to escape. However, this was the stronghold of the enemy. </p><p>I was being surrounded by a rapidly increasing number of followers. No matter how many calculations I made, there was just no way to escape. There was no hope when I was a slow as a tortoise.</p><p>“Break through to the basement at once!”</p><p>As I was planning out my actions, Doran shouted at me before pulling out two daggers and throwing them without delay. The hand gestures were so fast that it happened in an instant.</p><p>Pepeok!</p><p>“Kuaack!”</p><p>One of the daggers struck a person’s eye while the other pierced another’s heart. Doran narrowed the distance towards the pained believers and wielded his dagger.</p><p>“Open up.”</p><p>The believers couldn’t even scream as their necks were sliced and they vanished into a flash of grey light. I couldn’t resist admiring it. The lack of information meant I didn’t know the exact levels of the Yatan believers, but temple NPCs were generally at least level 150+. These believers were likely to be the same. </p><p>Doran handled them so easily that I couldn’t even imagine his level.</p><p>‘Is he perhaps a named NPC?’</p><p>My impression of Doran changed. Maybe I could clear this absurd quest if I depended on him. 3,000 gold! A huge 3,600,000 won was in front of me! The earl’s son-in-law! I imagined getting my hands on all stats +20 and a beautiful wife! I would become a lord with my own territory, where I could steal high taxes from the users and NPCs!</p><p>‘If I become a landlord, I will be able to get revenue every month.’</p><p>Exciting! </p><p>I began to cheer Doran on. “Good! Doran, fighting! I have admired you for a long time!”</p><p>“Eh? For a long time? When have you ever seen…”</p><p>“Ah! Danger! Over there! You must take care of your body!”</p><p>“B-Body…?”</p><p>While Doran was surprised by my sudden change in attitude, he focused on dealing with the enemies in front of him. Grey lights appeared in succession.</p><p>‘Really strong!’</p><p>Doran skillfully threw numerous hidden weapons as if they were merely extensions of his limbs. The number one person on the assassin ranking, ‘Old Sword Demon’, that I saw on a broadcast two months ago, was like a young child next to Doran.</p><p>‘Isn’t he three times stronger than Ashur? I must befriend him and ask him to assassinate Ashur!’</p><p>The Yatan believers ignored me and attacked the threat, Doran. But their efforts couldn’t stop Doran’s advance. Doran focused solely on those who were chanting spells, attacking them to stop their magic.</p><p>The black magicians couldn’t cast their magic, making them no threat.</p><p>“Amazing! You are really amazing! Doran, you are my god!”</p><p>I heard a magic spell being recited and cheered as a black magicians mouth was pierced by Doran’s dagger.</p><p>The best! By relying on the strength of the NPC, I really could complete this quest! Truly a fantastic quest! It seemed pathetic that I had been trying so hard to refuse the quest a few minutes ago!</p><p>I could barely chase Doran with my slow pace, thanks to Doran occasionally stopping.</p><p>“Are you waiting for me? How kind. Hehe.”</p><p>Doran was looking around with a terrible expression. “These guys have started to use their heads.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>I looked around like Doran and saw that the black magicians were chanting spells at the same time.</p><p>“Blessed souls underground.” </p><p>“Use your grudges and fears to ensnare the enemy.”</p><p>“Those who feel fear will have their legs restrained.”</p><p>“Their minds will be crushed and they will lose their willpower.”</p><p>“Become a doll with a lost soul!”</p><p>The black magicians chanting the spell alone would be stopped by Doran before they finished. Therefore, the group shared the spell by chanting the sentences one by one. Those sentences would connect to form one spell and the magic would be cast.</p><p>“Be prepared.”</p><p>I grabbed Doran’s collar and said, “Be prepared? You should do something!”</p><p>“It is too late.”</p><p>“Dammit!”</p><p>Kuoooooh!!</p><p>A line of blood was drawn on Doran’s face, and black energy rose like a mist to cover Doran.</p><p>“N-No! I am finished if you die!”</p><p>I had boarded the same boat as Doran and Doran was the oarsman. I couldn’t escape the quest failing if I was alone on this boat.</p><p>“Cough!”</p><p>I cursed and shouted towards Doran, who was coughing up blood. “Fuck! If it was going to be like this, you shouldn’t have made me feel expectant in the first place!”</p><p>At that moment. A green light flowed from the ring Doran was wearing and surrounded him. Then Doran’s complexion was gradually restored.</p><p>‘W-What?’</p><p>Doran attacked the surprised black magicians, who were chanting new spells.</p><p>“This ring is special. It protects the wearer from curses and poisons; however, the protection isn’t perfect. The damage is cumulative, so I need to avoid as much magic as possible.”</p><p>“Yes, indeed! The great Doran is even wearing a small ring like this!”</p><p>The ring was clearly had an Epic or higher rating. Was there a way to obtain it? As I was thinking, Doran started to slaughter the enemies again. He allowed a few magic spells to be cast but eventually succeeded in creating a path. </p><p>Doran started at the entrance of the staircase leading to the basement.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>“Yep!”</p><p>Unlike my vigorous reply, I chased Doran down the stairs at a slow pace. The black magicians pursued us with spells, but they were no threat because Doran threw daggers as soon as he heard chanting.</p><p>“Young Lady!”</p><p>Doran and I arrived at the dark basement. Doran found a beautiful woman bound to the altar in the center of the basement and ran to her. But there was a crowd blocking him. There were a dozen black magicians.</p><p>I laughed at them. “These ridiculous bastards! They need more people than that to be our opponents! Now, Doran! Get rid of them!”</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Doran nodded and wielded his daggers in front of him. Doran might be tired, but the number of opponents was too small. I was excited as I imagined the black magicians turning into grey light. The quest clear signal was right around the corner.</p><p>“3,600,000 won and the earl’s daughter, here I come!”</p><p>Tatatang!</p><p>“…Eh?”</p><p>There was an unexpected result. The hidden weapons that were thrown by Doran suddenly stopped and fell to the ground. Doran’s advance was also stopped.</p><p>“Shield?”</p><p>Defense magic couldn’t be used by black magicians. It was only possible for black magicians who completed their second class advancement. As I was baffled, a young woman walked out from among the black magicians. It was a woman who boasted the best beauty, a unique beauty that caused the beauty of the noble young lady to pale in comparison. </p><p>Somehow, she looked familiar? I checked her name and was shocked.</p><p>‘Blood Witch!!’</p><p>The Blood Witch. ID: Yura.</p><p>The Korean user who was ranked number one on the black magician ranking and ranked number five on the unified rankings. She was a famous person who frequently appeared on TV because of her beautiful appearance and outstanding abilities. Why was she here?</p><p>Yura looked towards me and stretched out a hand. “I’m sorry, but I can’t allow you to take away the sacrifice.”</p><p>Peeng!</p><p>A red fire sword emerged from Yura’s hand. Its momentum was fierce. Unlike a black magician who didn’t have a lot of attack magic, she was well versed in it. I was intimidated as I saw the flames.</p><p>‘Did I get this far, only to die?’</p><p>Why the hell was she here? As despair filled my body, a notification window popped up.</p><p></p><p>[You have been hit by a blow!]</p><p>[A legend doesn’t die easily. You can resist all attacks for 5 seconds with the minimum amount of health.]</p><p></p><p>I had one health point remaining. I had temporarily forgotten about it, but the attribute of my title was activated and I temporarily had an immortal body. Yura’s face was perplexed as she saw that I survived, despite being hit by her magic.</p><p>“That was clearly a critical hit… Based on the equipment, you are only around level 80. So how are you fine after being hit by that attack?”</p><p>Yura asked while hiding herself behind the black magicians in preparation for Doran’s counterattack. She always had a calm smile on TV, so I was probably the only one who had seen Yura’s flustered expression.</p><p>I ran forward and shouted to Doran, “Quickly! Let’s finish it in five seconds! I’ll use my body to block their attacks, so Doran must kill them! I believe in you, Doran! My god!”</p><p>The spells of all the black magicians, including Yura, were concentrated on me. This meant that Doran could strike freely. The best development. </p><p>‘Yes, hit me! No matter how you hit, I won’t die!’</p><p>Today would be the day where an ordinary user would stand up to a ranker. </p><p>I narrowed the gap towards Yura as all types of curses and attack spells hit me, while Doran followed the path I made and dealt devastation to all the black magicians. Then Doran stepped on my back and jumped towards Yura.</p><p>Yura blocked his attack despite being in a state of confusion. On the other hand, Doran’s momentum rose.</p><p>‘We can win!’</p><p>But was it because Doran stepped on my back?</p><p></p><p>[You have died.]</p><p></p><p>“……?”</p><p>Eh? Eeeeh? I wanted to reject this situation, but reality was cruel. A new notification window popped up as my vision turned grey.</p><p></p><p>[Quest failed!]</p><p>[Your level has dropped by 2.]</p><p>[You are now level -3.]</p><p>[As you have died two times within 24 hours, you won’t be able to connect to the game for 12 hours.]</p><p></p><p>Hah, it somehow turned out like this. I gazed towards Doran fighting… No, my last sight as I closed my eyes was that damned Blood Witch.  				</p>'),(266,12,'Chapter 7',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 7</p><p>The average level of black magician users was level 53. Out of the 120,000 classes in Satisfy, the black magicians had the lowest average level. The Black Magician class was a combat profession, but users of this class had very weak defense and insufficient attack power. </p><p>However, Yura had been hunting alone without a party since she starting, demonstrating unmatched control skills that harmonized with her magic. Her ability to select hunting grounds was also excellent. There was a good reason why Yura surpassed two billion users to rise to fifth place in the rankings.</p><p>Three hours ago, Yura had finally reached level 230, resulting in new wings being added to the list of her abilities.</p><p>‘Now I can use defensive magic…’</p><p>Yura confirmed the A-grade spell that she acquired after much difficulty. </p><p>‘Diamond Barrier.’ </p><p>It was a spell to create a shield by materializing mana with a hardness comparable to that of a diamond. It was a defense type magic that could be acquired with a black magician reached level 230.</p><p>After completing all the conditions required to learn Diamond Barrier, Yura headed straight to the Yatan Temple. As always, she headed to a temple with fewer users. It was troublesome since it was a long distance, but it couldn’t be helped. It would be annoying if she went to a place with a lot of users, due to her high popularity. It was amazing how many people recognized her, even when she concealed her face and ID.</p><p>After running for two hours, Yura arrived at the Yatan Temple and placed the prepared spell book on the altar. The moment she was about to learn new magic after professing her deep faith in God Yatan.</p><p></p><p>[A foolish group of enemies hostile to God Yatan has appeared inside the temple.]</p><p>[Guardian of the Temple] </p><p>Difficulty: S</p><p>There are foolish people who have entered in order to rescue the sacrifice to God Yatan. You must defend the dignity of God Yatan and punish the blasphemous intruders.</p><p>Quest Clear Conditions: Repel attackers or defend the sacrifice for one hour.</p><p>Clear Reward: The title ‘Guardian of Yatan’s Temple.’</p><p>* Guardian of Yatan’s Temple: Faith +300, Health +1,000, Intelligence +60</p><p>You are an example to other believers after defending the dignity of God Yatan. God Yatan will bless you more, and the faithful will worship you.</p><p>Quest Failure: Level -2, Faith -250.</p><p></p><p>Yura was surprised since she had only experienced an S-grade quest three times, despite being level 230. Then, a lot of noise was heard in the distance.</p><p>‘Is this an auto-generated quest due to the advent of an intruder? I’m lucky I came to the temple at this time.’</p><p>Yura was very motivated. She greatly desired the ‘Guardian of the Yatan’s Temple’ title because it elevated all the important stats.</p><p>First of all, Yura grasped the location of the sacrifice and then went to the place where the disturbance was happening. She witnessed an NPC in leather armor ruthlessly slaughtering the followers of Yatan.</p><p>‘An NPC who has finished the third class advancement.’</p><p>Indeed, an S-grade quest had a much higher level of difficulty. The NPC called Doran was a great threat to Yura.</p><p>‘Even if I borrow the power of the believers, it will be a difficult quest to succeed.’ </p><p>She received an S-grade quest after a long time, but unfortunately, the chances of success seemed low. </p><p>‘No, there is no point in guessing.’</p><p>Yura calmly dispersed her mana throughout the entire temple. This wasn’t a normal use of mana for black magicians. In other words, it was to detect the enemy. While the detection skill was only available to those with a fine mana manipulation ability, it was but a simple matter for Yura. </p><p>‘Including Doran, there are two people.’</p><p>Yura grasped the number of enemies and looked at the user following Doran. ID: Grid. Looking at his equipment, he seemed to be a level 80 user. It was surprisingly low for the person who must’ve triggered the S-grade quest.</p><p>The only one to be careful of was Doran. If so, this quest could be cleared.</p><p>Yura meticulously observed the terrain of the temple while her enemies focused on fighting the believers. She made a judgment and went down to the basement where the sacrifice was located.</p><p>The temple was too spacious and there was a lot of cover, so it was advantageous for Doran. She planned to use the hostage in the relatively small basement to limit Doran’s movement and increase the hit rate of her magic.</p><p>After a while, Doran and Grid finally entered the basement. Doran was already quite exhausted from dealing with all of the believers. </p><p>“These ridiculous bastards! They need more people than that to be our opponents! Now, Doran! Get rid of them!”</p><p>The user Grid, shouted and Doran nodded as he fired his hidden weapons in front of him.</p><p>“3,600,000 won and the earl’s daughter, here I come!”</p><p>Grid was confident about the quest succeeding. Yura felt sorry for him, but she also needed to clear her quest so she acted without any hesitation.</p><p>Tatatang!</p><p>Yura defeated Doran’s hidden weapons with the recently learned Diamond Barrier and turned her gaze to the astounded Grid.</p><p>“I’m sorry, but I can’t allow you to take away the sacrifice.”</p><p>Doran was strong. In order to focus on him, it was wiser to deal with the relatively weak Grid first. Yura summoned fire and attacked without any delay.</p><p></p><p>[Critical!]</p><p></p><p>The greatsword was a weapon that warriors specialized in. It was clear that Grid’s class was that of a warrior. If he was a warrior around level 80, then no matter how good the equipment, his maximum health would be around 4,000. But Grid wasn’t wearing any special equipment. He should have approximately 3,000 health. Furthermore, warriors were very vulnerable to magic.</p><p>Yura calculated that she could deal with Grid in one hit by consuming one-fifth of her mana. It was a critical hit, so it was normal to think that Grid died. But surprisingly, Grid survived.</p><p>‘How?’</p><p>Let’s say that his luck was so high that he survived the critical hit. However, it was common sense for a character to become stunned after received 40% or more damage in a single attack. Grid was standing without being stunned as if 40% of his health hadn’t been decreased.</p><p>“That was clearly a critical hit… Based on the equipment, you are only around level 80. So how are you fine after being hit by that attack?”</p><p>Yura was ranked fifth among the pool two billion users, and she was narrowing the gap between her and the fourth-ranked person. Her gaming skills were truly overwhelming. She knew that her magic damage calculations were never wrong. Her calculations had never been wrong while playing Satisfy so far. This was a new experience for her. </p><p>That confusion it caused greatly affected her.</p><p>‘Why is this happening? Is his level actually far higher than the equipment he is wearing? No, that isn’t likely. A person who dares to wear low-level equipment during an S-grade quest… Did I overlook something?’</p><p>She tried to calmly analyze the situation, but Grid was approaching.</p><p>Step. Step.</p><p>He was a warrior walking a very slow pace, as if he wasn’t in a hurry to narrow the gap towards the black magicians. It was an attitude that seemed to disregard Yura’s fifth place ranking. Grid’s behavior seemed to be saying to Yura, ‘I am giving you enough time to chant a spell. Use your best magic.’</p><p>An obvious provocation! Yura, who had a strong self-esteem, was furious. As Grid wished, she started to chant the top-level attack magic. She was determined to turn him into ashes, along with Doran.</p><p>“Great god of the darkness, your humble servant calls you. Fill this place with darkness and plant fear in the enemies’ hearts, show your power to those who worship you.”</p><p>As magic power started to rise, the torches lighting up the basement started to go out. The torches actually weren’t turned off; the magic just turned the flames black. Soon, the darkness swallowed up this area.</p><p>A normal enemy would lose their vision and stop due to the added ‘fear’ effect of this spell. In fact, Doran hesitated for a moment from where he was hunting the black magicians behind Grid. But Grid was approaching like it was nothing. He had a higher resistance than an NPC who had completed the third class advancement.</p><p>‘What is his identity…’</p><p>The ID was too strange. He wasn’t a ranker, then how was he so strong? Her confusion grew and Yura couldn’t easily recover. But the spell was fully completed.</p><p>“Dark Storm!”</p><p>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</p><p>A silent storm formed in the darkness and struck Grid. The effect of the storm caused the pillars supporting the basement to wobble, while cracks appeared on the ground and walls. A mighty power that could topple the whole temple! It was the moment when a high-ranking dark attack magic was revealed.</p><p>Kwaang!</p><p>Grid’s body, that was already damaged from the black magicians’ attacks, was overwhelmed by the storm. Yura believed that Grid would turn into a grey light. But Grid was still fine as he kept walking forward, penetrating through the storm without pause.</p><p>On the other hand, Doran’s body behind him was a rag, barely following Grid as a green light emerged from his ring. Even a third advancement NPC couldn’t cope with the magic, so why was this user fine?</p><p>“You… what are you?”</p><p>Yura was a smart girl. She could see through anything with logic. In her 21 years of life, she had been praised by everyone she met for her beauty and intelligence. She used her innate insight on her work, earning her a reputation of a talented person who could be used everywhere. </p><p>Satisfy was the path that she finally chose. </p><p>Anyway, this brilliant Yura couldn’t figure out the man called Grid. </p><p>‘This is an impossibility in the current Satisfy. This overwhelming presence isn’t an NPC but a human… Is he a bugged user? No, Satisfy is controlled by the world’s leading supercomputer, Morpheus, so there are no bugs. There is clearly a rational way to get this strength. How did he gain such strength?’</p><p>It was the first time she encountered something beyond her common sense. She was baffled and very curious. At this moment, the person called Grid was deeply imprinted onto Yura’s mind.</p><p>On the other hand, Grid was coming closer to her with imposing footsteps. Yura couldn’t easily give up so she prepared to fight. Then Doran stepped on Grid’s back, jumped up, and attacked her.</p><p>Kaaang!</p><p>Yura hurriedly blocked Doran’s attack magic and turned her gaze towards Grid, expecting an attack, only for her eyes to widen. The body of Grid, that had been fine just a moment ago, was covered with a grey light and was disappearing.</p><p>“……?”</p><p>Afterwards, Yura received big injuries as she struggled with Doran and barely managed to subdue him. She stared at the place where Grid disappeared, ignoring the system window that informed her of the success of the quest.</p><p>‘Even if he were hit by Dark Storm, he wouldn’t have died so suddenly. He must’ve been penalized and forcibly logged out. Why?’</p><p>Yura’s expression gradually worsened as she thought about it.</p><p>“Did he yield the quest to me…?”</p><p>She felt helpless and received Grid’s sympathy. That day became the worst day to Yura, of when her sturdy pride was thoroughly shattered.  				</p>'),(267,12,'Chapter 8',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 8</p><p>“Uwaaaack! Doran, that bastard! He forcibly gave me a quest I didn’t want, only to kill his teammate? Fuck! Thieves, robbers, and thugs, now I know why there are all these names. Doran! In the future, this name itself will be a curse!”</p><p>I left the capsule, opened the window and shouted outside. The rain was strong so my voice wasn’t heard by the people in the neighborhood.Thanks to that, I was able to shout for a long time.</p><p>It wasn’t 4 o’clock in the morning yet. It was a day when my family could rest until late afternoon due to the heavy rain, but I couldn’t access the game for 12 hours during such a golden holiday season!</p><p>“Level -3…the more I think about it, the worse I feel. Doran, Doran, Doran!”</p><p>I headed to the bathroom to cool off my head that was flush with anger. I soaked my face in cold water and listened to the gushing stream of water. I felt much better after washing my head for two days straight.</p><p>“…Doran isn’t to blame for the situation.”</p><p>Unlike my prediction, Doran was extremely strong and fought well. I was a bridesmaid and didn’t have to do anything. Doran took care of all of the enemies by himself. I only had a chance to succeed in the quest due to Doran’s power. </p><p>Yes, Doran did really well. However, an unexpected situation occurred. The appearance of a ranker.</p><p>“Damn witch…”</p><p>Why had Yura appeared there? She was a black magician. The Yatan Temple was an important base for black magicians, so it wasn’t unusual for her to appear there at any time. Why did Yura interfere? I was an intruder in the temple and she was obliged to protect the temple. It was obvious that she would be hostile to me. That was understandable.</p><p>‘The moment I accepted the quest, the black magicians in the temple had a separate quest to stop me. The real enemies are the users, not the NPCs. There is a reason why Doran was so strong. No wonder why the S-grade quest felt too easy.’</p><p>I concluded.</p><p>‘Witch… thanks to me invoking the quest, you were able to receive a lot of benefits. A girl who didn’t shed blood or tears. She tried to kill me instead of thanking me…’</p><p>After I died, Yura would’ve succeeded in the quest. Yura was strong and Doran was quite exhausted. It was really detestable.</p><p>It was because of me that Yura received the quest in the first place, and the reason Doran was so tired was because I was weak. Yura just sat back and ate bread. The bread that I had put in her mouth.</p><p>“Bad person…”</p><p>A ranker over level 200 had snatched the quest of a minus level! I entered the capsule, connected to the Internet, and then searched for Yura.</p><p>Yura, I just typed it in and hundreds, no, thousands of related links filled the screen. I only checked the postings of highly popular blogs and large-scale communities and managed to get information about Yura.</p><p>Contrary to her creepy nickname of the ‘Blood Witch’, she was well loved and respected, as well as a target of envy.</p><p>Thanks to her superb beauty, perfect gaming skills and ideal image in the media, she was praised by both men and women. It also transcended race. There were thousands of fan clubs created on overseas servers. At first glance, she was even more popular than Hollywood’s top actors.</p><p>‘That is the modern world now.’ </p><p>Satisfy was more colorful, thrilling and dramatic than any movie, so the main characters of Satisfy enjoyed more popularity than movie stars. If someone watched TV these days, hundreds of channels were filled with Satisfy related programs. They also achieved high ratings, so Satisfy profession news channels were created. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t just limited to South Korea. Satisfy had more than two billion users. The broadcasting market wasn’t just South Korea, but the world. As a result, the movie actors received less exposure than Satisfy’s protagonists, the rankers.</p><p>In particular, Yura was much more recognizable than other rankers due to her beauty. Thanks to that, she had both money and fame. It was a perfect contrast to me, who was in debt due to Satisfy. </p><p>‘I am suffering because of the game, while she is living a fantastic life because of it.’</p><p>Enjoying her favorite game while being recognized by the world? I was incredibly envious. If I was Yura, I would have no disappointments in my life.</p><p>“…A person like you had to take  away a poor person’s quest.”</p><p>She wasn’t a witch. She was just a really wicked girl.</p><p>Kwaduduk!</p><p>I opened up the hologram keyboard and started to comment on Yura related posts one by one.</p><p>‘Yura is garbage. She interfered in the quest of a low-level user. She is completely different from her appearance on TV. Her personality is rotten.’</p><p>‘Yura isn’t very pretty when you see her in real life. She got plastic surgery a facelift. There is dirt on her nose and she always looks like she is chewing shit. Her smile is just for the TV.’</p><p>‘Why is Yura good??? She is a bad person. How many people has she ruined? She also ruined my brother-in-law.’</p><p>‘A ranker interfered in a quest!! Don’t be fooled by the image created on TV.’ </p><p>“Huhuhu…! Kukukuk!”</p><p>I informed people about what I actually experienced with Yura. I felt great because I became a great journalist who spread the truth to the people deceived by false information. The terrible reality that I experienced a while ago was gradually fading from my mind!</p><p>Tadak. Tadadak.</p><p>I continued posting comments. My ten fingers tapped against the hologram keyboard that glowed in the darkness. A person tapping on the keyboard in the darkened room, someone who saw it might think it was beautiful and mysterious.</p><p>“Oppa… have you finally gone crazy?”</p><p>Writing malicious comments… no, it was a movement to reveal the truth. </p><p>I jumped in surprise at the voice that was suddenly heard. I turned my gaze towards the source and saw Sehee staring at me from the door.</p><p>“You surprised me.”</p><p>I placed my hand on my chest, while Sehee entered my room with folded arms.</p><p>“I was going to the toilet when I heard Oppa giggling in your room. You were crazy about the game, so I thought you went crazy in reality. I was worried about Oppa and decided to check on you. Are you crazy? Please say that you’re not.”</p><p>“…Why are you speaking like that to your Oppa? I’m not crazy.”</p><p>“I’m glad you’re not crazy yet. Urgh, something smells. Take a look at your head, you should wash more. And get rid of that bowl of rice that you ate! No, why are you eating rice in your room in the first place? You should eat together with us… bah, no.”</p><p>Sehee looked at the empty rice bowls and side dishes that I stacked up and started cleaning up. </p><p>‘This girl, she is nice and pretty. It is good that she doesn’t resemble me.’</p><p>I watched her approvingly. Sehee felt my gaze and turned around.</p><p>“Don’t just sit there and watch. If you’re not busy, shouldn’t you help? No. Go and wash up. I don’t like that appearance.”</p><p>“Leave it and I’ll take care of it. Why are you getting up when it isn’t even morning yet? Go back to sleep.”</p><p>“I saw Oppa laughing in a creepy manner, so my sleepiness has fled. Please go wash up. I want to see your face properly after a long time… ah, no! Wash off that dirty and unpleasant scent!”</p><p>When Sehee was one year old, I was nine years old. Was it right for my younger sister to act like this?</p><p>‘If I knew this would happen, I would’ve washed up when I washed my head.’</p><p>I headed to the bathroom in an annoyed mood. I washed my head with soap and dried it with a towel. But why was my hair so stiff?</p><p>“…It was laundry soap.”</p><p>I returned to my room with my stiff hair and smelled something different in my room. It was a rather refreshing scent. Did she spray perfume? Sehee was truly meticulous. The room had been cleaned and tidied up during the time I used to wash up. She was a very diligent girl, unlike me. She would be a nice bride.</p><p>I saw Sehee sitting in the capsule and laying down on my bed.</p><p>“Connect to the Internet if you want~”</p><p>Anyway, it wasn’t like I could access the game. I easily yielded the capsule to my little sister.</p><p>Sehee shrugged and unexpectedly sent me a look of disdain. “Oppa… are you a keyboard warrior?”</p><p>“Keyboard warrior?”</p><p>What did that mean? When I looked up, Sehee got up and pointed her finger to the monitor floating in front of the capsule.</p><p>“Why are you spreading false rumors about a woman younger than you? Even if there is a reason, this behavior is too naughty. I’m really disappointed in Oppa.”</p><p>Her voice sank. Sehee was sincerely angry. I belatedly realized my mistake and hurriedly checked the monitor. The damning list of comments that I made about Yura was still showing.</p><p>Dammit! I should’ve turned off my Internet window!</p><p>“S-Sehee, this…”</p><p>“How low.”</p><p>I tried to explain to Sehee, but she returned to her room and locked the door without giving me a chance to talk. The door wouldn’t open, no matter how pathetically I acted. I realized that the last bit of good opinion my sister had towards me was completely lost.</p><p>This…what is this!</p><p>“This is all due to that witch!”</p><p>I appealed to Sehee in front of her room. I didn’t realize that I fell asleep there until I was woken up by my mother. My body wasn’t trained at all! It hurts…</p><p>I placed a cold patch on my body and fell asleep again. Then the next day.</p><p>“Huaaah~~”</p><p>I opened my eyes and saw that it was 11 a.m. My parents went to work at dawn and Sehee would be in school for three hours already.</p><p>“I slept only six hours. I can’t oversleep because of my diligence… Why did God make me so diligent?”</p><p>I scratched my hips above my underwear while heading to the kitchen. I was hungry but it was too annoying to cook. </p><p>“Forget it.”</p><p>I ignored the protesting cries of my stomach and headed to the living room. Then I lay on the sofa and turned on the TV. It was a Satisfy related channel </p><p>Satisfy was even covered on the housewives channel. The title of the program was ‘How to meet a young man through Satisfy!’ It was a program that dealt with the process of making a character in Satisfy look as young and pretty as possible.</p><p>‘…PD Cheon Jaende?’</p><p>It seemed to have pretty high viewership. I skipped past a man who didn’t think he would live long after a phone call from his wife. I stopped at a program called ‘Satisfy’s Hot Issues.’</p><p>A cute female reporter was greeting an Asian youth around my age. There was a close up of the young man’s face. At the bottom of the screen, the ID ‘Katz’ and level ‘203’ appeared as subtitles.</p><p>“Katz is already level 200?’</p><p>Katz was a celebrity. He was notorious due to his arrogance, but he was always one of the top ranks in the warrior class. Three months ago, he was level 170 but now he was already level 203? At that level, he would be at the top of the unified rankings.</p><p>‘How did he get over 30 levels in three months?’</p><p>The reporter on screen was asking the same question as me.</p><p>–Katz, did you know that you are one of the biggest issues in Satisfy these days? Our producers were very surprised. In just three months, Katz has climbed up to the 53rd ranking. What is the secret to your rapid growth over such a short period of time? </p><p>Katz swept a hand over his well-trimmed hair and smiled smugly.</p><p>–Three months ago, I obtained an epic class. I accepted this interview today to reveal my epic class.</p><p>–Yes?!</p><p>The reporter was shocked and I also stopped scratching at my groin. The news of an epic class was so shocking that the reporter couldn’t respond to Katz. In the past year, only two epic class changes had appeared in Satisfy.  Its value transcended the imagination. But Katz got his hands on a new epic class.</p><p>‘The third epic class…’</p><p>There was no information about the previous epic classes that appeared. The contents of the first class change book were confidential when circulated around the item trading sites, and no one knew who the owner was. </p><p>The second epic class belonged to Agnus, who was ranked 7th on the unified rankings, but nobody knew what class he had.</p><p>It was because most users, especially top rankers, were extremely reluctant to disclose their information. Information was power! </p><p>There was a fierce competition to survive in Satisfy. The information shared among large sites was actually quite limited. Most users kept their information to themselves. I would do the same.</p><p>However, Katz was revealing his class himself. He was famous for liking colorful and prominent things.</p><p>Anyway, this was a huge scoop. It was possible that the ratings record might be broken. </p><p>I remained fixed on this channel. I focused on the screen, while the reporter’s eyes were shining with excitement.</p><p>–What class are you?</p><p>–The name of my epic class is ‘Blood Warrior’.</p><p>–Is it as special and terrible as the name implies?</p><p>It wasn’t special or terrifying. It was a very common and mundane name. A sloppy name for an epic class. But Katz seemed to like the childish name.</p><p>–The name isn’t that great, but it is a very fantastic class. Let me tell you one important feature…</p><p>Katz pulled out the sword hanging from his waist, emitting a tremendous aura. I would be able to pay off all of my debt if I just sold that sword.</p><p>–Look.</p><p>Katz’s eyes were tinged with red. At the same time, his sword started to wriggle.   				</p>'),(268,12,'Chapter 9',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 9</p><p>The camera zoomed in on Katz’ sword. </p><p>Hundreds, no thousands of blood vessels appeared on the blade and grew at a fast pace, completely covering the sword. Within a short time, Katz’s sword was covered with red blood vessels and pulsated like a living heart. However, the sword’s edge actually became sharper instead of disappearing. It was a very menacing appearance. On the other hand, it was also a bizarre and disgusting appearance.</p><p>But Katz patted the wriggling red sword as if it were adorable.</p><p>-This is my passive skill. Any weapon held in my hand would be transformed into this shape. When I attack an enemy with this modified weapon, I can absorb a certain amount of health in proportion to my attack power.  Thanks to this, my reliance on potions has greatly reduced and hunting alone has become easier. The more I attack, the more I can take advantage of this tremendous hunting speed. In addition to this, powerful combat skills were created, so I am able to raise my level quickly.</p><p>The reporter, whose face was pallid, continued the interview while ignoring the hideous sword.</p><p>–Is an epic class that much stronger than regular classes?</p><p>–That is a stupid question. Isn’t this natural? Even if it was only a rare class, it exerts a special power over general classes. I can assure you of this: I will rise to the number one ranking sooner or later. I have that type of ability.</p><p>–Number one in the top 10 rankings that haven’t changed in the past year? All 10 users protect their position and won’t give it to anyone. This means that the top 10 rankers are extraordinary. Isn’t it too much to declare that you can catch up to them just because of one class?</p><p>Was the reporter stupid? The arrogant Katz was going to become upset again.</p><p>As I expected, Katz started frowning. He looked at the reporter and declared.</p><p>–You say that it is just because of one class? How funny! I have a natural talent! The class of Blood Warrior is just a means to effectively show my talent! Agnus got an epic class much sooner and could only reach 7th place in the rankings. I’ll let everyone know that I am fundamentally different from Agnus!</p><p>According to the rumors, Katz was the son of a leading Japanese conglomerate. This was why he was famous for his high pride. After scaring the reporter who spat the mocking remark, Katz took the microphone from her and declared,</p><p>-Everybody listen up! This Katz will soon be first place in the unified rankings! The reason I announced my class today is to make the existing rankers aware of my strength and to make them tremble in fear. Kukuk, just wait! Sooner or later, I will cast you all aside!</p><p>Katz was about to return the microphone to the reporter when he suddenly stopped. Then he asked the reporter.</p><p>–Did you say that this is a Korean broadcasting station?</p><p>The reported nodded at the words. Katz smiled at her.</p><p>–This worked out well. Tell this to Yura: don’t be so proud of being part of a country that has nothing except for S.A Group. The era of Korean gaming experts is over. I will trample on her, the last pride of the Korean gamers, sooner or later. Hahahat!</p><p>The reporter’s eyes were tearful while her face distorted like she was smelling chicken poo. I clicked my tongue while watching Katz.</p><p>“The microphones for broadcasting stations in the game are limited and expensive items. Is he proud because of all his money? Mister natural wealth. But Blood Warrior…”</p><p>I was envious. Drain health skills always showed great efficiency in past games. Furthermore, the combat skills that Katz boasted were powerful skills of an epic class. At first glance, Blood Warrior was a powerful class.</p><p>“It isn’t more than me.”</p><p>Pagma’s Descendant was a production class. Production classes usually didn’t have any attack skills, so it was likely that Pagma’s Descendant was the same. But that didn’t mean I was weak in battle. Pagma’s Descendant was a legendary class that allowed me to go against Yura.</p><p>My status resistance was extremely high, and the immortal mode that lasted five seconds was a scam. It was possible to grow as a huge tanker. But was that all? All equipment could be worn without restrictions. It might be possible to cover the insufficient combat strength with the power of items.</p><p>“In addition, production classes are money factories.”</p><p>Why were there so many users who chose production classes over hunting? The reason was money.</p><p>Pagma’s Descendant was a legendary blacksmith class! It was a goose that laid golden eggs.</p><p>‘If I make a good item and sell it, I might be able to escape from my debt.’</p><p>I believed it was a class that could make me hundreds of millions of won. I returned to my room and turned on the capsule. Then I went on the Internet to find information about blacksmiths.</p><p>There was a lot of unfamiliar jargon and knowledge to memorize, but I concentrated on studying as much as possible. How much time passed? </p><p>While having another attack of hunger, I entered the living room when I heard a big fuss from the TV. </p><p>The ‘Breaking News’ subtitle appeared on the TV screen.</p><p>–I just received breaking news. It is said that the Yatan Temple, located in the northern part of the Eternal Kingdom, has collapsed. It is surprising and unusual for a well-preserved temple to collapse overnight. What is the story behind it? Let’s go to the scene. I am Reporter Lee Kyungmin.</p><p>The screen shifted from the studio to a familiar place.</p><p>“This place…”</p><p>A location was illuminated on the TV. It was the Yatan Temple where he resurrected yesterday and met Doran. The huge temple, larger than the Capitol Building, was surprisingly half collapsed.</p><p>When I saw the scene, I recalled the dark storm caused by Yura.</p><p>‘That magic… was it huge enough to destroy the temple? She is a really horrible girl to use such a fearsome spell on people.’</p><p>My fear of the witch I faced yesterday slowly amplified over time. If we accidentally met on the street by chance, I was afraid that I would pee my pants. Katz said he could beat her? </p><p>“Bastard. You really don’t know who you are talking about. She is already in a different dimension. A monster.”</p><p>The male reported conveyed the news.</p><p>–At around 3:40 a.m. today, a user visited this place and witnessed an amazing sight. Korea’s number one ranker, who is fifth in the unified rankings, Yura was fighting someone. Who did she fight that she had to use enough strength to destroy the temple? Was it a struggle with a top ranker? If so, why were they fighting in this place? Was there perhaps a hidden quest? There are many questions. Then let’s listen to the testimony of an eyewitness.</p><p>A boy, who seemed to be a middle school student, was caught on camera.</p><p>The boy’s ID and level were subtitled at the bottom.</p><p>The boy spoke,</p><p>–Yesterday, I was here because of a quest. I was forced to flee to the temple while being chased by a monster. The believers who should’ve been present weren’t there. However, a large commotion was coming from underground, so I went down to the basement…</p><p>The boy stopped talking and asked the reporter.</p><p>–Is there a mosaic over my face right now? It is time for me to go to school. If my mother catches me in the capsule, I’m dead.</p><p>At almost the same time, the boy’s face and ID were completely covered with a mosaic. The reporter nodded.</p><p>–Of course there is a mosaic. There is voice modulation as well. Please tell me with confidence.</p><p>The stupid boy sighed with relief. Poor guy… his mum would kill him. His unhappiness would be my happiness! I felt better. </p><p>The boy continued,</p><p>–I went down to the basement and saw Yura. I was captivated by her beauty. Mister, have you seen Yura? Really! She is even prettier than Kim Taehee! A complete goddess!</p><p>–People around the world are already aware of her beauty. We will put aside that story. What was happening in the basement?</p><p>–It was amazing.</p><p>–What specifically was so amazing?</p><p>–There were almost 20 black magicians constantly casting magic at a single person, but he didn’t receive a single point of damage. Even the curses had no effect. He laughed like he didn’t feel anything and moved towards Yura. Yura was nervous.</p><p>The reporter was confused.</p><p>–The basic level of the Yatan Temple’s NPCs is known to be 160. He was attacked by level 160 NPCs and received no damage?</p><p>–It was like he resisted all of it. Really.</p><p>–Resisted dozens of spells? That is impossible, even for a top ranker… Is he ranked higher than Yura?</p><p>The reporter’s expression wasn’t happy, but the boy didn’t care and continued speaking.</p><p>–He isn’t a top ranker. I have never seen the face before. Nevertheless, he defeated all of the black magicians and threatened Yura. Yura used Dark Storm…no, it seemed like she used every bit of magic she had. It was too strong that it even broke the temple, but that user was fine. Yura’s expression was disturbed as she stared at him with an expression similar to fear… I am a member of Yura’s fan club, so I know that Yura isn’t the type of person to look like that. I never imagined that Yura could make such an expression.</p><p>The reported looked dubious but still showed great interest.</p><p>–So what happened in the end? And what was the man’s ID?</p><p>The boy shook his head.</p><p>–ID… Well, that… what was it? I can’t remember. I was so entranced by Yura’s beauty that I didn’t observe him properly. Then I was killed by a falling pillar, so I don’t know the result.</p><p>–I see… Who is the man who dealt with 20 black magicians and Yura, despite not being a top ranker? I would like to know. This is Reporter Lee Kyungmin.</p><p>Unbelievable! The hand holding the remote control shook. My heart started thumping. The man in question on the news, it was me. This was an opportunity. Since this incident happened on TV, I would receive lots of requests for interviews and would be able to make a profit from shooting commercials.</p><p>The screen switched back to the studio, with a panel filled with experts discussed the man in question, me. I called the broadcasting station right away.</p><p>(Hello, this is BCC’s viewers consultation center. How can I help you?)</p><p>“The man from the breaking news. Aren’t you looking for him right now? The person who fought Yura.</p><p>(Yes. Do you have a tip?)</p><p>“The person is me.”</p><p>(…Ah, yes. As part of the confirmation process, can you give me your Satisfy ID and some brief information?)</p><p>“My ID is Grid. My class is Pagma’s Descendant and my level is -3. Oh, Pagma’s Descendant is a class obtained from a legendary class change book…”</p><p>Tutu-</p><p>“……”</p><p>The station one-sidedly hung up and didn’t pick up my call again. It seemed that my number had been registered as spam.</p><p>“Stupid person! You will regret missing out on the scoop of a lifetime!”</p><p>I wanted to try other stations, but decided to let it go. As I thought about it calmly, I was reluctant to leak information about the minus level and legendary class.</p><p>“It isn’t the time yet, right?”</p><p>I focused on the TV screen. Then I saw a familiar figure on TV.</p><p>“Doran…?”</p><p>It was really Doran. The present TV screen showed a large image of the ruins of the Yatan Temple, with a small box at the top where the experts were discussing. Doran was in the center of the big screen. He was too small so the cameraman didn’t seem to see him, but I was able to recognize Doran.</p><p>I pushed my face right in front of the TV and watched Doran quietly. He was barely crawling from the ruined temple, a woman held in his arms.  The identity of the woman was the earl’s esteemed daughter that Doran had been looking for. </p><p>The destruction of the temple caused great confusion among the believers, allowing Doran to somehow rescue her. The woman stood up and screamed something at Doran. She seemed to be crying. Then Doran handed something small to the woman. After a short time, he died and turned into a grey light. The woman shed tears and headed elsewhere while cherishing the item she received from Doran.</p><p>“Doran…died…”</p><p>He wasn’t a human but an NPC. A false life made by the system. However, it wasn’t comfortable watching the death of an NPC I built a bond with. They had minds and a clear body temperature.</p><p>“Also, the ring…”</p><p>I trembled as I recalled the effects of the ring that Doran had worn.</p><p>“When an NPC dies, all their equipment will disappear as well… That ring, if you were going to die anyway, you should’ve given it to me.”</p><p>I looked out the window where rain was still pouring down. I didn’t feel well. In addition, I was hungry. After satisfying my hunger, I connected to the Internet again to gather as much information about blacksmiths as possible.</p><p>The time was 3:55 p.m. The 12-hour penalty was over. I had to log on to Satisfy.</p><p>“Login.”  				</p>'),(269,12,'Chapter 10',_binary '<p></p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>“Going to the Mubaid Ruins, one must be level 130 or higher!”</p><p>“Looking for those who want to hunt in the Grey Forest ~ A level 130 warrior is waiting for people higher than level 96~”</p><p>“Recruiting people for the Guardian of the Forest raid! A level 190 archer, level 181 martial artist, and other top rankers will join! Your class and level don’t matter! Anyone will do!”</p><p>When I accessed the game, I stood in a town square. I couldn’t resurrect at the Yatan Temple due to being in a hostile relationship with the Yatan Church.</p><p>‘Bairan Village?’</p><p>It was the place I visited before proceeding with Ashur’s quest. I frowned as I recalled the past memories.</p><p>“I got turned around.”</p><p>The monsters near Bairan Village were at least level 100. In addition, they were all ferocious monsters. The level of users here was at least the mid-80s, and they always needed a party when hunting. It was a dangerous place where users below level 120 couldn’t leave the village alone. </p><p>In the past, I wandered around here alone while searching for the Northern End Cave and died. At that time, the durability of some of my equipment was reduced to zero and my boots and gauntlets shattered.</p><p>“I ended up resurrecting at this place.”</p><p>Maybe I was some stupid god in my past life. I probably dishonoured Lady Luck in my past life, then my memories were erased and I was banished to the human world. Since then, I lived an unlucky life.</p><p>‘This is true. I can’t be so unlucky unless I sinned directly against the goddess of luck.’</p><p>I placed my forehead on a wall and blamed my past life. I couldn’t be here forever, so I recovered my spirit.</p><p>“I should go to another village.”</p><p>Right now, the urgent thing was to raise my level. I wanted to escape from the minus level as soon as possible. There was no reason to stay in a village where hunting was impossible. I found a horse-drawn carriage waiting for customers in a corner of the square and asked the coachman. </p><p>“What is the safest village near here?”</p><p>“Winston Village. Many novice travelers visit that place. Do you need a driver to take you there?”</p><p>“How much?”</p><p>The coachman raised one finger. He was a crook. Carriages were means of transportation for the rich: they were tremendous luxuries for debt-ridden people like me. It was a luxury comparable to eating a whole marinated chicken for one meal!</p><p>But there was nothing I could do. Right now, it was impossible for me to move to another village with my own power. If I left the village, I would only walk a little bit before dying.  I handed over one silver while shedding tears.</p><p>The coachman looked at me. “What are you doing? It is 10 gold.”</p><p>I made a surprised expression, as if I really didn’t know. “Heok! 10 gold? It is 10 gold, not 10 silver?”</p><p>“This must be the first time you are taking a carriage. In the safe zone, the base fare for a carriage is set at five gold. In a monster-infested area such as this, there should be some profit for the high risk. This price is actually cheap. Winston is close to here, so it is only the basic fare.”</p><p>“You are charging so much just for driving a carriage!”</p><p>“Tsk tsk, this is why I don’t like novice travelers. Don’t you know that all the monsters in the vicinity will attack as soon as they find humans?”</p><p>“No! I know that there aren’t any monsters fast enough to catch up to the speed of a carriage!”</p><p>The coachman flinched. My point had struck him. The coachman coughed and explained, “Obviously, the monsters have slow feet. But they know the terrain and have the instincts of natural hunters. They use these advantages to catch up.”</p><p>It was like selling drugs.</p><p>“Then you should be vigilant.”</p><p>“Cough… then I will accept nine gold.”</p><p>Okay. The price bargaining had begun. The basic rule of bargaining was to cut it as much as possible!</p><p>“10 silver.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>What? Why wasn’t he saying anything? The response was different than expected. Wasn’t it normal to say, ‘10 gold is too cheap. I will accept eight gold?’ Then I would return with 20 silver, the coachman would offer seven gold. Then 30 silver, six gold… </p><p>This was my grand plan to complete the bargaining at around two gold. But the coachman just ignored me, making the plan become distorted.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to bargain?”</p><p>“Who in the world would bargain with a crook like you? This useless bastard! I was kind enough to cut it to nine gold, yet you offered 10 silver? You want me to bargain? Who is going to make a deal with a bastard like you?”</p><p>“Isn’t there the saying, ‘ the customers is king?!’ I will sue you and make you unemployed!”</p><p>“If you want to sue me, do it! Do you think the union will take your side? Get lost, you insane bastard!”</p><p>In Patrian, my bargaining was always successful because my reputation and affinity with the residents were at the maximum. Even if it didn’t work, I just laughed it off. However, this response was entirely new to me.</p><p>It was serious. At this rate, I wouldn’t be able to ride the carriage. Currently, I only had 3 gold and 11 silver. The difficulty of the Ashur quest was so terrible that I spent a lot of my money on potions.</p><p>“Please… My sick mother is in Winston Village all alone… She will die soon. What a sad son I will be if I can’t watch my mother’s last moments… Please take pity on me and consider the bargain.”</p><p>I looked as miserable as possible and told a heartbreaking story. </p><p>But the cold-hearted coachman just snorted. “You are obviously telling a lie. You didn’t even plan to go to Winston Village in the beginning, so who would believe you now?”</p><p>“…Sheesh, you’re smarter than you look.”</p><p>“W-What! You cheap bastard!”</p><p>There was no chance of this succeeding. I ran away from the coachman who chased me with a red face and visited other carriages. But despite being as careful as possible, it was impossible to bargain it down to three gold. No matter what heartbreaking stories I used, the limit was 8 gold and 90 silver.</p><p>I was frustrated by Satisfy’s modern society.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Was it necessary to be stuck at level -3 while being isolated in the remote Bairan Village?</p><p>“I can’t do that.”</p><p>I had a means to obtain the money for the carriage. Just make items! If I made an item, I could gain some experience. If it had a normal rating, I could sell it to a store. I opened the skills window and confirmed the ‘Blacksmith Craftsmanship Skill.’</p><p></p><p>[Blacksmith Craftsmanship Skill] </p><p>Lv: Master</p><p>Produce equipment items that you know how to make.</p><p>There is a certain probability of creating rare rated items.</p><p>There is a low probability of creating epic rated items.</p><p>There is a rare probability of creating unique rated items.</p><p>* Due to the effect of mastering the skill, the attributes of all items are increased by 10%.</p><p>* When rare rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +2. </p><p>Reputation throughout the continent will rise by +30.</p><p>* When epic rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +4. </p><p>Reputation throughout the continent will rise by +80.</p><p>* When unique rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +12. </p><p>Reputation throughout the continent will rise by +300. </p><p></p><p>“This is absurd…”</p><p>According to the rankings, the first place blacksmith only had intermediate level blacksmith skills. Despite producing tens of thousands of items by the time he reached level 110, he barely reached the intermediate level. Thus, he said that production skill levels are hard to raise.</p><p>However, I basically mastered the ‘Blacksmith Craftsmanship Skill’, which was beyond the ‘Advanced Blacksmith Technique’ and ‘Intermediate Blacksmith Technique’. If the person ranked number one in the blacksmith rankings were aware of my presence, he would probably quit the game.</p><p>‘When compared to him, I finally realize the greatness of a legendary class.’</p><p>I then confirmed the other ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill.’</p><p></p><p>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill] </p><p>Lv. 1</p><p>Produce equipment items that you know how to make.</p><p>You can create the production methods for a new item with the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation’ skill.</p><p>There is a certain probability of producing rare~ epic rated items.</p><p>There is a rare probability of creating unique rated items.</p><p>There is a very rare probability of creating legendary rated items.</p><p>*All stats of a production item will increase by 10%.</p><p>* When rare rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +2 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +30.</p><p>* When epic rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +4 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +80.</p><p>* When unique rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +12 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +300.</p><p>* When legendary rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +25 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +1,000.</p><p>* Something special will occur with every five legendary items created. </p><p>“Wow…”</p><p></p><p>The ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill’ was only level one. Nevertheless, it was far superior to the mastered ‘Blacksmith Craftsmanship Skill’. I couldn’t help admiring it. I was excited and immediately confirmed the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation’ skill.</p><p></p><p>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation Skill]</p><p>You can create three equipment item production methods every time the skill level of the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill’ goes up. </p><p>Number of items that can be created at present: 3/3</p><p>* When items are produced using this skill, the name of the creator is automatically placed on the item. </p><p></p><p>“Create an item? What is the method?”</p><p>The explanation wasn’t easy to understand. Seeing was believing. I decided to try it out. I used the Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation Skill without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>[What item do you want to create?]</p><p></p><p>The most important item was naturally a weapon. A weapon allowed quick hunting and was directly linked to high levels. Among the weapons, I thought the best one was a greatsword. </p><p>Thick, big, beautiful… </p><p>A big sword that could smash the enemy’s armor was a man’s romance! Up to this point, I never selected a weapon other than a greatsword in games. Then first, let’s make a greatsword.</p><p>“Greatsword.”</p><p></p><p>[Have you decided?]</p><p></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p></p><p>[What materials would you like to use?]</p><p></p><p>Ohu~ that’s right. I was creating a production method, so I needed to use the materials. Wasn’t it natural to use special materials? I thought of the person asking for party members to go on the ‘Guardian of the Forest’ boss raid.</p><p>‘I heard that the guardian of the forest drops the best mineral so far… the name is…’</p><p>I recalled it and replied, “Blue Orichalcum.”</p><p></p><p>[Have you decided?]</p><p>“Yes.”</p>'),(270,12,'Chapter 11',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 11</p><p>[Please design the item.]</p><p></p><p>A blank blueprint appeared in front of me. I was baffled.</p><p>‘Design? How do I do that?’</p><p>I then knew what I should have done. Rather than visualize modern weapons such tanks and jet fighters, I needed to design a sword. Wasn’t it just a matter of the shape? I thought hard and started drawing on the blueprint with my finger. A correction effect seemed to be applied, as the picture perfectly displayed my thoughts.</p><p>‘I have to make it cool.’</p><p>First, the length of the blade was 2m and the width was 80cm. The thickness was 8cm. The length of the handle was set at 40cm. </p><p>“…This is the appearance of a greatsword that can be seen anywhere.”</p><p>The finished picture showed the limits of my impoverished imagination. I pondered for a moment before thinking of a good idea. I changed the shape of the blade to something curved like a scimitar and then extended the length of the blade to 3m.</p><p>“Is this okay?”</p><p>I liked the finished picture. It was like I was looking at a large scimitar with a short handle. At the same time, it had the heavy weight of a greatsword. </p><p>‘It is reminiscent of a shark’s profile. The part of the blade is like a shark fin, and the end of the handle is a shark tail.’</p><p>I admired the finished work for a while.</p><p>‘I have made something sophisticated and cool!’</p><p>It gave the impression of a swimming shark. If I held it, some people might have the mistaken impression that I was carrying a shark and be shocked.</p><p>‘I didn’t know I would be so good at designing. Once I make money and pay back the debt, I should change my major to design.’</p><p>I felt great satisfaction as I clicked on the OK button at the bottom of the blueprint.</p><p></p><p>[Have you decided? When you complete the blueprint, the number of available creations from the creation skill will decrease by one.]</p><p></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Once I replied, numbers and languages quickly covered the blueprint. Figures were being calculated. It seemed that the system was calculating the details that I lacked in my design. After a while, an improved and completed design appeared. A bunch of Jargon and complicated numbers covered the blueprint. </p><p>“Eh?” </p><p>I could fully understand the jargon and numbers on the blueprint. I looked at the design contents and checked if there were any faults. It was amazing. I understood that contents of an item design that I had never even seen or studied.</p><p>‘The class compensation effect!’</p><p>It was really great; I felt like an actual great blacksmith. As I was admiring it, a notification window popped up.  </p><p></p><p>[Please describe the characteristics of the item.]</p><p></p><p>“That’s right! Finally, the most important part is left!”</p><p>I was excited.</p><p>“This is an outstanding weapon. The attack power is one million… no, it is more than 10 million and the weight is only one. There is no level requirement. There is an option to absorb health with every attack. Can cause meteors to fall. The enemy will unconditionally die from one hit. Of course, defense is ignored. Anyway, this weapon is enough to hunt a dragon alone.”</p><p></p><p>[That isn’t possible. The performance and options of an item can’t be arbitrarily set. The performance and options are determined by taking into account the materials used, the design, and the description of the features.]</p><p></p><p>…Too bad.</p><p>I tried to make the explanation as good as possible.</p><p>“It is a greatsword, but thanks to its unusual shape, its cutting power is tremendous. The protruding part that resembles a shark’s fin will allow for unexpected attacks, and can even go through armor. Blue orichalcum is used as the material, so it is light and durable. And… and… um… well, that will be enough.”</p><p>Was my vocabulary so lacking? I was horribly ashamed. In the first place, I only knew that blue orichalcum was light and durable. I didn’t know the exact information, so I can’t explain the merits.</p><p>“Then… just…”</p><p>Suddenly, I felt like the back of my head was hit with a hammer. It was a belated epiphany but if I was designing this with blue orichalcum as the material, wouldn’t I need blue orichalcum to make the item?</p><p>‘I’m screwed.’</p><p>A level 200 boss monster dropped the material, while I was only level -3.  I could buy it from other people, but that wasn’t easy because the supply was small and the price was huge. It meant the design I made could become obsolete!</p><p>“Cancel! Skill cancel! Clear everything!!”</p><p></p><p>[The completion of the blueprint has already destroyed one of the available creation skill users. Even if you cancel the skill now, the number of times it can be used won’t be restored. Do you still want to cancel it?]</p><p></p><p>“…No.”</p><p>This was bad. It was a mistake in my thinking. It was a skill that should be used carefully after thorough investigation and thinking. </p><p></p><p>[Please name the item.]</p><p></p><p>“Uhh… shit…”</p><p></p><p>[Have you decided on ‘Uhhshit?’]</p><p></p><p>“What nonsense are you saying? Please wait! Geez, what is this?” </p><p>I didn’t worry about it for too long.</p><p>“Failure.”</p><p></p><p>[Have you decided on ‘Failure?’]</p><p></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Yes, it was a failure that shouldn’t have been created in the first place. I was saddened at the number of times I could use the skill decreasing, but a hologram of the items was listed in the drafts.</p><p></p><p>[Failure] </p><p>Rating: Unique ~ Legendary</p><p>Unique Rating Information:</p><p>Durability: 699/699   </p><p>Attack Power: 733~1,621    Defense: 50</p><p>* Agility +30</p><p>* There is a low probability of blocking the enemy’s attacks.</p><p>* There is a certain probability of activating the ‘5 Joint Attacks’ skill.</p><p>* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Cutting’ skill.</p><p>* There will be a fear effect if the enemy is more than 20 levels lower than the user. </p><p>* Attack power +20% in dark places.  </p><p>Legendary Rating Information:</p><p>Durability: 1,090/1,090   </p><p>Attack Power: 874~1,820    Defense: 80</p><p>* Agility +50</p><p>* There is a low probability of blocking the enemy’s attacks.</p><p>* There is a certain probability of activating the ‘5 Joint Attack’ skill.</p><p>* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Cutting’ skill.</p><p>* The skill ‘Bisect’ will be created.</p><p>* There will be a fear effect if the enemy is more than 20 levels lower than the user.</p><p>* Attack power +20% in dark places.</p><p>It is designed by a legendary blacksmith. It is a greatsword, but its cutting ability is excellent because of its unique shape. It resembles the predator of the sea, a shark, and gives fear to the enemies. The small blades spiking from the sword will increase the defense. </p><p>Blue orichalcum is used as a material. Its lightness means the attack speed doesn’t fall. Due to the nature of the blue orichalcum, it becomes stronger in the dark.</p><p>User Restriction: Level 300 or higher. More than 5,000 strength. </p><p>Advanced Sword Mastery level 8 or higher.</p><p>Weight: 550 </p><p></p><p>“…Hiccup!”</p><p>Amazing. It was a master weapon, not a failure. A one of a kind item in this world. And I was the one who created this item. I couldn’t believe it.</p><p>“Isn’t this huge?”</p><p>The words automatically emerged from my stunned mouth. Yes, I could be rich. If I went into more debt and bought blue orichalcum, I could make ‘Failure’ and put it on the trading site. Then the price of the item would skyrocket. Then I could pay all my debts and still have a lot of money left! </p><p>Truly a legendary blacksmith!  It was literally the goose that laid the golden egg.</p><p>“…Uh?”</p><p>Then that feeling sank as I read the stats and options of the completed ‘Failure’. I checked the usage conditions attached at the end.</p><p>“It needs level 300?”</p><p>Two days ago, I heard that the level of the first ranked person on the unified rankings was estimated to be around 250. </p><p>‘Then 300?’</p><p>That wasn’t the only problem.</p><p>“5,000 strength?!”</p><p>10 stat points were gained with every level. Even if a person invested all of their points into strength for every level up, it would be almost impossible to have 5,000 strength at level 300, even with titles and equipment that raised their stats.</p><p>‘There are classes that receive extra strength, but it isn’t common. In the first place, who would be idiotic enough to invest all of their points in strength?’ </p><p>Finally, there was the Advanced Sword Mastery level 8. Currently, the first ranked blacksmith had intermediate level skills. I couldn’t predict how long it would take for people to get Advanced Sword Master level 8.</p><p>Even if I managed to make ‘Failure’, nobody would be able to use it in the near future. This meant that selling it was impossible. My dream of making a fortune was shattered in an instant. As the name suggested, ‘Failure’ was a failure.</p><p>“…Then that’s it. There is no springtime in my life. Shit.”</p><p>I was frustrated but quickly corrected my mindset. Then I tried to deduce why such exorbitant usage conditions were attached to the item I created. It wasn’t difficult to come to a conclusion.</p><p>‘It was a mistake to try and make it unconditionally good.’</p><p>The development team of Satisfy had caught the hearts of the world, so they wouldn’t be that easy. ‘Failure’ wasn’t an item that could be acquired randomly through hunting or a raid. It was a production item that could be produced indefinitely if there were enough materials. It was likely that the system placed restrictions on the game items in order to maintain the game balance. Those restrictions were in the usage conditions.</p><p>‘An acceptable performance. Isn’t this the most important thing about the creative skills?’</p><p>The creation skill had a limited number of uses. It had to be used with care. I decided to seal the creation skill. If I created and sold superior items that didn’t destroy the balance, I would be able to earn a lot of money quickly and pay off my debt. However, I didn’t want to rush it.</p><p>I wanted to see it as the ultimate weapon to use for myself before encountering a difficult quest or a strong enemy.</p><p>‘The creation skill is for me. If I am in a crisis situation, I can create an item that can break through the situation.’</p><p>As a simple example, if I encountered a boss monster capable of causing tremendous fire damage, I could create and build an item that greatly increased my fire resistance properties before the raid.</p><p>If I didn’t create items for sale, I didn’t have to worry about the usage conditions. One of the biggest advantages of Pagma’s Descendant was that there was no restriction on the items I could wear.  If I created items with a fraudulent power like ‘Failure’, I could show the highest power among existing items, even if the penalty was attached. </p><p>After I cleared my mind, I checked how to make ‘Failure.’ The materials were also a problem. In order to produce ‘Failure’, I needed a huge supply 15 blue orichalcum ore.</p><p>‘Even the handle is made with blue orichalcum… It was a mistake to choose only blue orichalcum as the material. If I used other materials as well, the number of blue orichalcum ore required would be reduced.’</p><p>I saw Failure’s tremendous options, so I was filled with the desire to produce and use it right away. If I could get my hands on Failure, I would be able to demonstrate a fearful combat power. But it was impossible to obtain blue orichalcum.</p><p>‘Let’s get rid of this vain regret. No, wait. Can I participate in the Guardian of the Forest raid party? The person recruiting party members said that level was irrelevant.’</p><p>I remembered the Guardian of the Forest raid party and headed back to the center of the square. Then I walked up to the black man with the ID ‘Toban’.</p><p>“I would like to participate in the raid.”  				</p>'),(271,12,'Chapter 12',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 12</p><p>If not now, I didn’t know when I would be able to join a Guardian of the Forest raid party in the future.</p><p>“Please let me join the party.”</p><p>I would join the party, survive until the Guardian of the Forest died and pick up all the blue orichalcum that dropped. It didn’t matter if the other party members died. </p><p>‘Anyway, my experience can’t drop if I die!’ </p><p>If I were really unlucky, then I might drop Mamon’s Greatsword or Mengel’s Plate Armor, which made up my entire fortune. But if I took the risk, I might be able to obtain blue orichalcum. I expressed my strong emotions when I gazed at Toban. </p><p>Was I too brazen? Did I have any sense of shame? I looked up to see Toban looking at me with a perplexed expression.</p><p>“What is your level?”</p><p>“What? Didn’t you say that level and class doesn’t matter?”</p><p>“I did say that at first, but… unexpected party members arrived, so I am now looking for those who are over level 120, preferably those with divine magic or magician professions. As you may know, the Guardian of the Forest is a monster whose body is made of minerals, so physical attacks won’t work on it.”</p><p>Toban stared at my greatsword with an unconvinced look, a gaze that strongly conveyed that he didn’t want to accept me into the party.</p><p>‘Then this guy shouldn’t have said that he would take any level or class.’</p><p>Should I give up? No, I couldn’t give up when thinking about the blue orichalcum. I would join the party no matter what.</p><p>“Please accept me. I won’t hold you back.”</p><p>“What is your level?”</p><p>I was currently level -3, but due to Mamon’s Greatsword and Mengel’s Plate Armor, my actual combat ability was above level 30. If I confessed that I was level 30… I would be kicked out straight away.</p><p>“30… no, minus… no, plus 100.”</p><p>“30 minus, plus 100?”</p><p>“No ~ no. Just 100.”</p><p>I was currently level -3, but I would’ve been close to level 100 if it weren’t for Ashur’s quest. Let’s try it once.  When I actually entered the party, I didn’t intend to fight. Instead, I would follow like I was a dead mouse.</p><p>‘If I’m careful, they won’t notice that I deceived them about my level.’</p><p>Toban had a worried expression on his face.</p><p>“Your weapon is a greatsword? Isn’t it around level 65? Even if your item has an epic rating, claiming to be level 100… Are you really level 100?”</p><p>“Of course I am. My Mamon’s Greatsword has been strengthened to +5, so I can still use it.”</p><p>My face was still. I was just bluffing. I exploited the fact that items enhanced below +5 wouldn’t have a change in appearance, so I lied that the +0 Mamon’s Greatsword was actually +5.</p><p>But Toban wasn’t easy to pass.</p><p>“Even if Mamon’s Greatsword is +5, to still use it at level 100 is… In addition, your armor isn’t as good as the equipment that level 100 users can wear. Besides, where are your boots, gauntlets, and accessories?”</p><p>It was accurate. Mengel’s Plate Armor, which I was currently wearing, was only level 60.  My helmet, boots, gauntlets, and accessories were all lost by the end of the three months quest… </p><p>‘Items that are like my blood…’</p><p>In the case of the boots and gauntlets, they were destroyed because I didn’t manage the durability. I managed the durability of my helmet and accessories, but it was unfortunate that I dropped them when I died.</p><p>As I recalled the hellish past, Toban looked at me suspiciously.</p><p>I said, “The only people who don’t need armor and accessories are those with excellent control over their weapons, like me. In fact, I remove this armor whenever I hunt. I only arm myself with the greatsword on hunts.”</p><p>Control was a word that didn’t apply to me, as I drank potions like I drank water whenever I hunted. When I watched the hunters on TV, I saw them exquisitely take advantage of the monsters’ gaps, firing off powerful skills as they avoided the attacks of monsters. Meanwhile, I just took random potshots and drank potions whenever my health was low. That was my hunting method. </p><p>But right now, I needed to bluff to enter the raid party. Therefore, I quoted the remark I heard about control. However, that was a big mistake. Toban’s body was fully armed with heavy armor and a shield.</p><p>“Hoh… so people who wear armor aren’t skilled?”</p><p>He was smiling, but his eyes were cold. He was seriously angry. The problem was that the other party members around were also filled with righteous indignation.</p><p>“You make it sound like wearing armor and accessories is a bad thing.”</p><p>“Listen to him; He never wears armor.”</p><p>“Those who wear armor and accessories aren’t authentic? If we don’t want to be ignored, we should take it off…”</p><p>I tried to calm down the angry people who were talking sarcastically, “That’s too much. I didn’t mean anything bad, I was just explaining why I am less dependent on defense.”</p><p>“Anyway, that means that I shouldn’t be armed! Your level is lower than mine!”</p><p>A wild-looking, hairy middle-aged person interrupted with a shout. He was equipped with two shining axes, armor and gorgeous ornaments, looking completely like a high-level user. He looked angrier than all the others.</p><p>“Grid? This is the first time I’ve seen you. You, have you done any hunting at the hunting grounds around here? I know how powerful the monsters in this area are. You sure must be confident if you’re bragging about hunting them without armor.”</p><p>The other party members nodded.</p><p>“Based on his words, he must be a newbie to this area.”</p><p>“Have you ever seen someone called Grid?”</p><p>“I’ve never seen him at a nearby hunting ground. How about you?”</p><p>“Honestly, it sounds like crap… I think he is actually lower than level 100.”</p><p>“Looking at him now, it seems like he died and dropped his items on a lone hunt. Maybe his intentions to enter the party are impure. He already has nothing to lose so…”</p><p>The atmosphere was getting worse.</p><p>‘Sharp people… What now? Should I give up on the party?’</p><p>As I was feeling confused… A blond haired man with his upper body revealed appeared and intervened.</p><p>“Everybody stop.”</p><p>The party members became excited at the man’s appearance.</p><p>“First place in the martial artist rankings, Regas.”</p><p>“The equipment items requirements are so severe that raising the level is difficult, yet he is already over level 180.”</p><p>“His nickname is Taekwon Master, Taekwon Master. Is it true that a mob will melt when hit by his fists?”</p><p>“Wow~! He really came! I did well to join this party! Martial artists ignore defense to attack the weak point. Can’t this technique inflict huge damage to the Guardian of the Forest?”</p><p>Regas caught my eye and approached me. “A greatsword is very slow and has wide movements, so it isn’t easy to take evasive actions during battle. Therefore, it is amazing that you are hunting without wearing armor.” </p><p>Regas was good looking, slim, and had ideal muscles. Due to the nature of his class, he was popular with women because he didn’t wear any tops. In fact, when I looked closer at him, I saw that he was, in fact, very handsome. I felt like a squid standing next to him. </p><p>I instinctively hated handsome people so I replied bluntly, “It isn’t a big deal.”</p><p>“Hoh, it isn’t a big deal… My expectations about your skills have increased. I would love to directly see your amazing abilities.”</p><p>Regas said to the others, “This guy will also join the party. Originally, it was a party that had no limits on class or level. Some of the party members are below level 90, so I don’t think there’s a problem in accepting one more level 100 user.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>People still responded poorly, so Regas added,</p><p>“As you know, only level 170 or higher users can hit the Guardian of the Forest properly. Nevertheless, the reason why I gathered as many people as possible without a level limit is that people are needed to mark the golems constantly summoned by the Guardian of the Forest. The Guardian of the Forest will be dealt with by my 17 guild members, including Toban and Vantner. We want people to tie up the feet of the crystal golems while we focus on the Guardian of the Forest. I think that Grid’s skills are sufficient for our wishes.” </p><p>“……”</p><p>“He wants to join the party, so I don’t know why we should refuse. I can understand you doubting his actions, but why do you doubt people beforehand?”</p><p>The remarks of a strong person were reputable. Once Regas spoke, the party members had an atmosphere like they would accept me into the party. But they had impure intentions.</p><p>“Let’s see how well his control is.”</p><p>“Watch him fighting… We will see if he’s a braggart or not.”</p><p>“He said that he fights with his armor off? Then he can’t wear his armor on this raid.”</p><p>“I will watch him closely.”</p><p>A party filled with intense hostility! This wasn’t a Guardian of the Forest raid party, but a Grid raid party.</p><p>‘I can’t join this party.’</p><p>If I joined the party now, I would have to fight in front of them. As a level -3 player, I would surely die quickly and not even see the Guardian of the Forest, let alone see the blue orichalcum. It would also come with extra embarrassment involved.</p><p>“It’s okay. I won’t join the party.” I stepped back, causing the middle-aged man to laugh.</p><p>“Were you just bluffing?”</p><p>An attitude that ignored people! But I didn’t get angry because his words were true.</p><p>I replied coldly, “It isn’t a good idea to join a party with people who don’t trust me.”</p><p>Originally, party members should be able to trust each other with their backs. However, everyone here doubted me. The party members were forced to accept my words.</p><p>“Well… that is true.” </p><p>“Come to think of it, we were so excited that we drove him to the other end.” </p><p>“I agree. I didn’t know if it was the truth, so I should’ve just stayed silent.”</p><p>“That’s right. Actually, weren’t we the ones who committed the sin? I feel bad now.”</p><p>I didn’t hold onto the party members any longer and left this place. Regas followed me.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>My attitude was cold, but Regas just asked for a handshake with a gentle smile.</p><p>“I hope to see you again next time, Greatsword warrior who doesn’t use armor. As a person who walks along the path of a martial artist, I am very interested in you.”</p><p>I didn’t doubt that he was interested in me. I didn’t think it was a bluff as I gazed into his honest eyes.</p><p>I shook hands with him and thought, ‘Why is he so naive?’</p><p>He was a good person. If I had a chance someday, I would make him a friend that I could borrow money from.</p><p>“Then I’ll see you again.”</p><p>Take money from him later… no, I owed him. Therefore, I said goodbye to Regas with a big smile headed straight to the smithy.  				</p>'),(272,12,'Chapter 13',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 13</p><p>I only had 3 gold and 11 silver.

It meant I could readily obtain the desired production methods from blacksmiths.</p><p>“Wow.”</p><p>The Pagma’s Descendant class, the most I experienced it, the more I liked it. At first, I disliked it because it was a production class. However, it truly was a legendary class. I joyfully entered the smithy and found a blacksmith sweating in front of a hearth.</p><p>“I want to make and sell the most profitable item with the greatest demand. What is that item? Please give me a recommendation.”</p><p>I smiled brightly.</p><p>‘I am Pagma’s Descendant, someone who has mastered the Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill. Feel appreciation towards me, worship me, and hand over the appropriate crafting method!’</p><p>But the next development went against my expectations. Instead of the worshipping, the blacksmith gazed at me with cold eyes.</p><p>“Bah, a kid wants to talk about this subject. I don’t want to talk to a rude and incompetent person like you, so get out.”</p><p>“……?”</p><p>This was an ordinary NPC’s attitude towards level 1 users. </p><p>‘He didn’t recognize me?’</p><p>An intermediate or advanced blacksmith would instantly recognize me, but the blacksmith here didn’t know me. It meant that he was a low level blacksmith who hadn’t even reached the intermediate level.</p><p>‘Ah, you. I met a lousy person.’</p><p>I wanted to go to another blacksmith, but this was the only smithy in the village. I expected this to be easy due to the notification window, but it was in vain.</p><p>‘I forgot how unlucky I was. Dammit.’ </p><p>It couldn’t be helped. I hurriedly changed my attitude and respectfully spoke to the blacksmith, “You were so passionate about your work that I was afraid to disturb your concentration. Therefore, I wanted to quickly get to the point. Did I sound rude? If so, please forgive me.”</p><p>“Huh, I see. You have learned strange manners.”</p><p>The blacksmith looked at me with interest. I stood as politely as possible, like a man engaged in a service job.</p><p>“I am Grid. I would like to learn how to make items.”</p><p>The blacksmith snorted. “Bah, do you think anyone can learn how to make items? A child like you should start from firewood. No, not even. If you sincerely want to learn how to make items from me, you should go to the backyard and obtain firewood. You should be thankful that I am letting you do this.”</p><p>“…How expected from a lowly blacksmith.”</p><p>“Huh? Did you say something just now?</p><p>“No?”</p><p>I was the one feeling regret now. The only person I could depend on in this village was a lowly blacksmith. If I was kicked out from here without learning how to make items, I would have to save money while doing restaurant chores or working in the fields until I gathered enough for the carriage.</p><p>“I’ll chop the firewood. How much do I need?”</p><p>The blacksmith gave me an old axe and said, “As much as you can.”</p><p></p><p>[Chop Firewood] </p><p>Difficulty: E</p><p>Blacksmith Smith has given you an errand to chop firewood.

The amount of experience needed for minus levels seemed to be 20 points. In other words, at the minus level, I could raise my level just by doing these miscellaneous quests.</p><p>‘First of all, I need to escape from the minus level.’</p><p>I thought positive thoughts and headed to the backyard with the axe. After checking the trees piled up on one side, I looked at the axe in my hand. It was an old axe. Could this old axe be used to chop firewood? </p><p>‘Rather, I’m worried that the axe will be shattered upon hitting the tree… He might be angry if I break his axe, so I have to be careful…’</p><p>I decided to use the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal’ skill on the old axe.</p><p>“Appraisal.”</p><p></p><p>[The blacksmith who becomes a legend that appraises items with an excellent discerning eye.

Indeed, it would be funny if a legendary blacksmith looked at a normal axe and couldn’t understand its production method.</p><p>“There are no conditions of use, so I don’t think an increased understanding is useful. The advantage is that the axe production method is gained.”</p><p>A penalty would occur if I equipped an item that I didn’t meet the conditions of. The ‘understanding’ of an item was just a skill that played a role in reducing the penalty. Smith’s Old Axe was an item that didn’t have a usage penalty, so there were no advantages to the 100% understanding, except for the addition of the production method.</p><p>I didn’t feel much inspiration, but I placed the axe to one side and set up a log. I thought about spitting into my hands and rubbing them together, like the old man in historical dramas.</p><p>‘There is no need for physical power when chopping firewood. I just need to go along the grain.’</p><p>It was knowledge I picked up from somewhere, but I didn’t know exactly what it meant by following the grain. It was simply knowledge that couldn’t be applied. However, there was no need to worry. Couldn’t I just cut the piece of wood like I would cut a monster with my greatsword? </p><p>‘It is like using swordsmanship on a tree.’</p><p>I picked up the axe I had put aside. The moment I was about to chop the log… A solid black line was drawn near the center of the log.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Strange. I watched it for a moment before putting the axe down, watching the black line disappear like it was a lie. I picked up the axe again. The black line soon reappeared. It felt like the axe was telling me to hit the black line.</p><p>“This is the effect of 100% understanding.”</p><p>It was a possible interpretation, but I couldn’t be sure. I avoided the black line and hit the middle of the log with the axe.</p><p>Beeok!</p><p>Although I struck down with all my might, the axe failed and stopped halfway through the log. Chopping it in one go had failed. A notification window popped up stating that the durability of the axe had decreased by one.</p><p>“T-This humiliation…”</p><p>I couldn’t even chop firewood… I was useless here as well! I felt frustrated as I barely managed to pull out the axe stuck in the log. Then I threw the half split piece of wood to the side and picked up a new log.</p><p>“This time…”</p><p>I gazed at the black line and swung the axe.</p><p>Ttaak!</p><p>The moment the axe touched the solid line, a light sound was made and an exhilarating feeling  could be felt. The log was split in half without any resistance.</p><p>“Ohh!!”</p><p>I was forced to admire the effect of understanding the item, finally realizing the importance of understanding.</p><p>‘This is what it meant by handling the item perfectly. The benefit of increasing item understanding isn’t just reducing the penalties or learning how to make the item.’</p><p>There was an expression about treating items as another limb. If I raised a sword’s understanding to 100%, I could use that sword like it was my own limb. Item understanding could be thought to have the same type of concept as Weapons Mastery.</p><p>‘If I raise the understanding of items I created to 100%…’</p><p>Invincible!

However, the reason I was able to build amicable relationships in high school was through my persistence.</p><p>I wasn’t very smart.

I wasn’t good at exercising. During PE, I was able to play soccer with others because I tried diligently.</p><p>I knew this about myself, so I tried. I did my best to not give up. Thanks to my persistence, I was able to go to university and make it safely through the army. I might be debt-ridden because of Satisfy, but I barely managed to maintain an ordinary life.</p><p>Anyway, persistence was my strong point.</p><p>“Level… money…”</p><p>I was caught by this obsession and didn’t stop moving my axe. I had just chopped the 460th piece of firewood when suddenly, a notification window popped up.</p><p></p><p>[Persistence stat has been opened.]</p><p></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Surprisingly, it was a new stat.

Ttaak!</p><p>As the number of firewood increased, I developed the knack of hitting the firewood. </p><p>Despite hitting along the grain, the durability of the axe decreased by one point every 200 pieces of firewood.

Despite the compensation from the persistence stat, my -3 level stamina was still poor.</p><p>I had chopped firewood for only six hours, but I was exhausted. I ate the bread and water that I took out of my inventory and looked towards the east where the Grey Forest was located.</p><p>‘The raid party should’ve arrived at the Guardian of the Forest by now. It is good that I didn’t join the party… I would’ve been disgraced if I joined.’ </p><p>With my -3 level stamina, I wouldn’t even have been able to follow the movement speed of the other party members. How embarrassing would it have been if I died from exhaustion, not by a monster? I shook my head as I recalled my premature attempt to join the party.</p><p>‘When I think about it, I don’t even know the drop rate of blue orichalcum. My thinking was too simple when I tried to join the party. I should think and act more carefully.’</p><p>It felt like I had a small amount of mental growth. </p><p>After a while, I barely recovered and returned to Smith’s smithy.</p><p>“I finished chopping the firewood. I did as much as possible and managed to obtain 1,000 pieces.”</p><p>“What?” Smith burst out, “Puhahahahat! A newbie like you chopped 1,000 pieces of firewood in six hours? You aren’t just a newbie, but a liar as well! Are you trying to deceive me?”</p><p>He laughed like it was funny and glared at me.</p><p>‘Is this person bipolar?’</p><p>I pointed towards Smith’s backyard. “Isn’t it too much to lie that I chopped 1,000 firewood in six hours? If you don’t believe me, why don’t you go and check it directly?”</p><p>“You don’t have to tell me that. If you cheat me, I’ll kick you out of here straight away.”</p><p>I followed Smith towards the backyard. After a few moments… Smith’s mouth dropped open as he saw the 1,000 firewood piled up on one side.</p><p>“H-How is this possible…? How can someone like you cut 1,000 pieces of firewood so quickly? They’re also perfect…! No, the amount of time isn’t the problem. You don’t have the stamina to chop 1,000 pieces of firewood! Tell me honestly! Where did all this firewood come from? Did it come from Vans carpenter store? Or did you buy it from the woodcutter who lives in the mountains? Foolish guy! I asked you to chop the firewood yourself!”</p><p>“What? Why are you framing someone? These are my own logs of firewood!”</p><p>“Ridiculous! It can’t be!”</p><p>Was this person senile? Why didn’t he believe me? I picked up the axe. Smith flinched and stepped back as he saw it in my hands. I set up a log.</p><p>Ttaack!</p><p>My woodcutting technique had reached the peak after chopping 1,000 logs of firewood. As soon as the axe met the wood, a clear sound was heard. It was a thrilling sound that rang through the smithy.</p><p>Smith marveled at the sound and then looked surprised when he saw the log split neatly in two. After staring blankly, he nodded and opened his mouth, “I thought you were an ordinary newbie, but you’ve actually worked for a long time in woodworking.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Then, you’re a woodcutter.”</p><p>“No.” I reached out a hand towards Smith, who was talking nonsense. “First, give me the compensation.”</p><p>“Umm… Yes. The work is better than I expected, so I will give you more compensation than I promised…”</p><p>Doubt could still be seen in Smith’s eyes, but he pulled out 40 coins. At that moment, the quest completion notification window stated that I received 15 experience points. The way that Smith gazed at me also changed considerably. Before, he had looked at me like a cockroach, and now I was like a mutt on the streets?</p><p>I was proud. I had felt helpless in the successive S and SS-grade quests, so completing a normal quest after a long time gave me a sense of accomplishment. As I was bathing in the afterglow, Smith gave me a pickaxe.</p><p>“If you climb the mountain, there will be a mine.

I had a huge passive skill that was understanding items. If I took advantage of this, the mining job would be done without difficulty. I left the smithy without delay. As I headed to a small mountain in the back of the village, I asked a child passing by.</p><p>“Kid, do any monsters emerge on that mountain?”</p><p>Was he eight years old? The kid with the runny nose shrugged and replied, “Are you really asking that question? How can there be monsters on a mountain attached to the village? My dad says that the lord’s soldiers patrol this area for our safety. So you don’t have to be a shivering coward, Traveler.”</p><p>“C-Coward? Me?”</p><p>The spiteful expression and nasty tone! A nasty kid who provoked the urge to punish him. As I prepared to rub my fist on the child’s head, I saw a big man, probably the child’s father, approaching. The man looked between me and the boy with a disapproving expression.</p><p>“Boy, why are you hanging around that traveler? He looks stupid, so don’t associate with him!”</p><p>“Yes. I only replied to him because he looked so pathetic and frustrated.”</p><p>“Huhu, my son had to go through a lot of trouble. By the way, how did a traveler like that come to our village? Our village isn’t a place that lazy people can enter.”</p><p>“That’s right. But he asked me a question and I didn’t want to be rude.”</p><p>“Hahahat! Yes yes. Then let’s go to eat. Your mother is waiting.”</p><p>“Yes Father!”</p><p>The father and kid walked away. Dammit, now I was being ignored by a kid.</p><p>“It is too much.”</p><p>The NPCs’ attitude towards me was disturbing.  During the level 1-10 beginner days, the NPCs didn’t show a favourable opinion towards users, but they still taught us and helped us grow.  However, they unconditionally ignored me now that I was a minus level. They felt irritated just making eye contact with me.</p><p>My reputation might’ve increased by 500 in exchange for discovering Pagma’s Rare Book, as well as the dignity stat after changing classes, but the minus level itself seemed to have the worst affinity with NPCs.</p><p>‘Then Doran was a really nice person.’</p><p>I preferred a NPC like Doran, who mistook me for a high level. He forced me to accept the quest, but at least he didn’t ignore me.</p><p>‘When I think of Doran, I’m reminded of Doran’s ring.’</p><p>I still mourned the thought of the loss of Doran’s ring. </p><p>I gazed at the sky for a moment and soothed my mind.

It took me one hour to arrive at the base of the mountain.</p><p>“Phew.”</p><p>I was tired, despite walking even more slowly than others. It was amazing how creatures like turtles and slugs could live with their slow movement speed. After three hours,</p><p>“Pant pant…”</p><p>I was barely able to climb to the middle of the mountain.

There was no time limit. Yes, it would take a few days to gather the 80 iron ores needed to complete the quest. But I couldn’t relax after finding out that Smith obtained 120 iron ores in one day.</p><p>‘I am going to obtain 200 pieces in one day and then make that old man recognize me!’</p><p>I looked around the mine with the pickaxe in my hand. Red dots glittered all over the walls.</p><p>‘I am supposed to hit those spots.’</p><p>As I moved to one red dot, the miners resting on the side discovered me.</p><p>“Hey Newbie, why are you holding a pickaxe in your hand? Surely you aren’t trying to mine?”</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>“What? Puhahahat!!”</p><p>The miners laughed. Some of them rolled across the floor with tears in their eyes. Another person frowned and said. “Cut it out. A newbie like you can swing all day and not even obtain a single iron ore.”</p><p>The others agreed.</p><p>“You should be glad if you don’t break your wrist.”</p><p>“We are saying this because we are worried, so just go home. New. Bie.”  </p><p>‘Yes, laugh now.’</p><p>I didn’t respond to them. I would show them with my actions!</p><p>Kaaang! Kaaang!</p><p></p><p>[Iron ore has been acquired.]</p><p></p><p>The iron ore emerged after I hit the red dot three or four times. The miners were amazed at the sight.</p><p>“Ah, no? How can he do it so easily…?”</p><p>“Hey, it’s just a coincidence.”</p><p>Kaaang! Kaaang!</p><p></p><p>[Iron ore has been acquired.]</p><p></p><p>“Wow…”</p><p>“What, that guy? Why is he so good when he looks so incompetent?”</p><p>“Fools. That isn’t his skill. The pickaxe is special.”</p><p>One of the whispering miners approached me before reaching out and saying,.</p><p>“That pickaxe, can I try it?”</p><p>Did they think I was mining using the power of an item because they couldn’t recognize my skills? I wanted to see the expressions of the miners change when they realize that my pickaxe was ordinary. So I handed the pickaxe to the miner.</p><p>“Look carefully. I’ll prove that this pickaxe isn’t an ordinary one.” The miner declared and wielded the pickaxe with confidence.</p><p>Kakang! Kakakang! Kang! Kaaang! Kang!</p><p>“Pant pant… it’s just an ordinary pickaxe…”</p><p>The minor said awkwardly after repeating the swing of the pickaxe many times and only obtaining one iron ore. The miners who saw it were agitated.</p><p>“Then he is good at mining…”</p><p>“We shouldn’t judge people by their appearance. Anyway, it’s time for us to leave. Let’s head down.”</p><p>The miners ignored me and left the mine. They didn’t apologize for their mistake and or acknowledge my skills. </p><p>Anyway, I started the full-scale mining work.</p><p></p><p>[Iron ore has been acquired.]</p><p></p><p>“It’s really easy.”</p><p>The 100% understanding corrected my pickaxe swinging posture and accurately pinpointed the position I needed to hit. It felt like I could gather 200~300 iron ores. But that confidence only lasted a short moment. I became exhausted after a while. The act of hitting a wall in a semi-enclosed space consumed more stamina than chopping firewood.</p><p>“Pant pant… this damned…”</p><p>My breathing worsened when I obtained the 26th iron ore. My waist and arms started twitching. My level -3 body was screaming at me to take a break.  But I couldn’t rest. It was because my desire to raise my level quickly was greater than my desire to rest.</p><p>After adjusting my breathing, I straightened my posture and swung the pickaxe again.</p><p>Kaaang! Kakang!</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>By the time I extracted the 41st iron ore, the sensations from my wrist and waist started to disappear. Sweat poured like rain down my body. My legs weakened by I persisted in swinging the pickaxe. I couldn’t see the sky when I raised my head, only the stifling ceiling.</p><p>I wanted to rest. But I wanted to earn money by learning how to make items quickly. My hands trembled as I moved my pickaxe.</p><p>Kakang! Kajajak!</p><p>“Pant… pant… ah, I’m dying.”</p><p>Once it was the 59th piece of iron ore, my vision became blurry from fatigue. My muscles screamed. My shaking hands couldn’t hold the pickaxe tightly. I soothed my hunger with bread and water and persisted.</p><p>This was my limit. Right now, I wanted to throw the pickaxe in my hand away. But I actually gripped the pickaxe tighter.</p><p>“I won’t give up because of this. My job is labour! Uraaaaat!”</p><p>Kakang! Kakang! Kakakang!</p><p>I was debt-ridden because of the game; I was a loser in reality. One day, I heard from a friend that my high school alumni ignored me and ridiculed me.  It was bitter because I knew that the friend who delivered the news had acted the same as the alumni. </p><p>My friends from the army and university? I hadn’t been in touch with them for a long time. Ah, I was contacted four months ago by an army buddy. He was working for a multi-level (pyramid scheme) company and was willing to offer me a job. It was easy to see who disregarded me. </p><p>I didn’t bother speaking to them to change their opinion.</p><p>If I told them that I was crazy about a game, they would just look at me like I was pathetic.</p><p>I was so embarrassed about my pathetic self that I couldn’t go to the second reunion. However, it was the only way to meet my first love, Ahyoung, so I attended an alumni meeting when I was on vacation from the army…</p><p>There was nothing pleasing about what happened. I was only able to forget about reality and find stability when I logged into Satisfy.</p><p>But that was a while ago. Now, Satisfy was no different from the real world. Even the NPCs were ignoring me! This wasn’t the real world. I needed to grow as quickly as possible. I would raise my level, earn money and escape my debt. Then I would become a ranker. Then like Katz not long ago, I would be interviewed on TV.</p><p>I was Pagma’s Descendant! The epic classes that made two billion users astonished? They were nothing in front of the legendary class!</p><p>“I will show the worldddd!!!”</p><p>Kaaang!</p><p></p><p>[Iron ore has been acquired.]</p><p></p><p>“I must succeed.” </p><p>Due to the debt, I was doing labor work every day. Then I would tell all those who ignored me. I wouldn’t ignore the abuse again. In fact, you lot weren’t that great either!</p><p>My pickaxe moved again. My persistence stat steadily grew. As I became more and more familiar with the mining technique, the speed that the durability decreased slowed. Before I knew it, the bright morning sun shone. The miners who came to work were amazed to see me.</p><p>“Did that guy work all night?”</p><p>“Unlike how he looks, he has enormous stamina. No, how is his mental state still fine? What an amazing guy.” </p><p>“Heok! Look at the amount of iron ore! Has he broken Smith’s record?”</p><p>“Aish, how can he break Smith’s record? I honestly admit that he is doing well but… eh? Hey, hasn’t his mining skill improved overnight?”</p><p>During that day, I fell into a critical state several times and minimized the amount of time spent mining. I experienced dangerous situations and almost died several times while mining, but was able to pass the crisis and got 170 iron ore by lunch time.</p><p>Despite it being less than my target of 200 iron ores, I couldn’t continue any longer because my water ran out.</p><p>Stagger. Stagger stagger.</p><p>The miners watched as I left the mine with barely any strength left.</p><p>“This person, great… I have to admit it. I apologize for what I said yesterday and for ignoring you. Please forgive me for my rudeness.”</p><p>“You will surely be a great miner! No, with this great spirit, you will succeed in whatever you want to do!”</p><p>The miners who ignored me yesterday now acknowledged me. Being acknowledged by someone, it was a valuable experience that I only had a few times in my life. I was proud, even if the other people were NPCs.</p><p>I descended the mountain with lighter steps. Overnight, my persistence stat had risen to 16 points. My stamina also rose, so I was able to descend the mountain without becoming tired.</p><p>I dragged the heavy sack of iron ores towards the smithy. It felt like the gazes of the villages had significantly changed. The miners had spread my story through the village.</p><p>“Uh, I’m sorry for yesterday, Miner.”</p><p>The kid from yesterday had a complete 180-degree change in attitude as he apologized to me. His father also smiled at me.</p><p>My level was still minus. However, the attitude of the minors and people who ignored me suddenly changed in a day. It seemed that the ‘easily acknowledged’ characteristic of my title was applied.</p><p>‘I feel good…’</p><p>The world of Satisfy, which had grown similar to reality after I became a minus level, now felt like a haven again. I smiled and gave the boy a light pat. Shortly afterwards, I arrived at the smithy.</p><p>He already heard. Smith had a stunned expression as I handed him the bag containing 170 iron ore.</p><p>“How is it? Can you still call me a newbie?”</p><p>“Haha…” Smith checked the number and condition of the iron ores, then shook his head with a thrilled expression. “No, you’re a great person, not a newbie. You have great talent and will grow to be a great person by overcoming any hardships.”</p><p>Smith asked me for a handshake.</p><p>“Someone like you dreaming of becoming a blacksmith, all blacksmiths on the continent will rejoice. Thank you for giving me the glory of teaching you.”</p><p>I willingly shook hands with Smith.</p><p>Smith smiled warmly and continued, “You were very good. You also broke my mining record, which no one else has done. I will give you twice the promised reward.”</p><p>There was a notification information me of the quest’s success, then the rewards started coming in.</p><p></p><p>[Reputation in Bairan Village has increased by 200.]</p><p>[1 silver has been acquired.]</p><p>[Affinity with Smith has risen to 60.]</p><p>[Your level has risen.]</p><p>[Your level has risen.]</p><p>[Your level has risen.]</p><p>[Your level has risen.]</p><p>[You are now level 1.

I didn’t panic. If I were in reality, I would’ve pinched myself. However, I just calmly logged out of the game. I lay in the capsule in my room and stared for a few moments.</p><p>“I was sleeping without knowing it.”</p><p>This was a good possibility because I didn’t have the capsule switched to sleep mode. I went to the bathroom to resolve my bodily needs, poured cold water over my head, and returned to the capsule. I logged in again.</p><p>Just like in my dream, I was standing in the smithy.</p><p>“Was it not a dream…? No, I shouldn’t anticipate anything.”</p><p>If an unlucky person like me started expecting things, the wounds on my heart would also grow. I opened the status window without any inspiration and literally froze.</p><p>“…An amazing jackpot.”</p><p>There were no changes to the contents of the status window. It wasn’t a dream. My heart started beating quickly again.</p><p>“Wow…”</p><p>The basic stats of a level 1 character were 6 strength, 7 stamina, 4 agility, and 5 intelligence. In other words, the total number of stats for a level 1 character was 22 points.</p><p>However, the basic stats of Pagma’s Descendant added up to 165 points in total. In addition, there were the 16 points in persistence that I grew as well as 1 point in indomitable, making a huge total of 182 points.</p><p>Using simple calculations, my stats were higher than level 15 users, which meant that I had an overwhelming advantage. I realized the greatness of a legendary profession.</p><p>Besides…</p><p>‘These are just the basic stats but…’</p><p>I paid attention to the extra 40 stat points I had.</p><p>‘Why was I given stat points?’</p><p>Stat points were increased by 10 points every time someone gained a level, so I should have 0 points at level 1. Therefore, I pondered upon the reason why I was given 40 points. There were many theories, but there was only one hypothesis that was persuasive.</p><p>‘Perhaps… are stat points obtained every time you level up, even at the minus level?’</p><p>I was level -3 and leveled up four times in order to reach level 1. This was the only reason I could think of for the 40 stat points. I rubbed my eyes but the 40 stat points didn’t disappear. I was so thrilled that I starting shaking.</p><p>‘My experience in the minus level wasn’t in vain!’</p><p>All of my struggles were meaningful. Maybe I wasn’t as unlucky as I thought was.</p><p>“Kuk! Kukuk…!”</p><p>Was there a language in this world that could express this joy? I could only laugh.</p><p>“Puhahahahahat ~ ~ ~ ~!!!”</p><p>The sound of my laughter was proportional to my joy. The people in the smithy left as I laughed so loudly that my belly hurt. However, I just couldn’t stop. After a while, “He! Keke! Puha…! Urghh…”</p><p>Smith stared at me as I laughed through the pain and raised his thumb. “This is a hero’s excited laugh! You are such an outstanding figure that I don’t know how I mistook your identity yesterday. My vision was lacking. I am ashamed and embarrassed.”</p><p>I laughed like a madman but he still saw me as a hero? This meant that Smith’s affinity with me was at the maximum. While it was true that I had escaped from the minus level, raised my affinity with two quests, and earned a reputation in Bairan Village of over 200, Smith’s attitude towards me was still overly flattering.</p><p>‘Even if my title has the attribute of being easily acknowledged…’</p><p>I met Smith’s eyes, causing him to lower his gaze. This was the attitude of a student in the presence of his master!</p><p>‘Is this the effect of the dignity stat? It’s only at 10 points at the moment, but is it already having an effect?’ </p><p>It was possible, considering that Smith’s level wasn’t very high.</p><p>‘It might be different with high ranking NPCs. However, dignity seems to have an effect on normal NPCs, even with the number of points in it isn’t high.’</p><p>I never imagined that his attitude would change so much in a day. It was an excitement beyond my current excitement.</p><p>‘…First, let’s calm down. Let’s calm down and try to figure out how the stat points work.’</p><p>I worried about it for a moment. Over the past few days, hadn’t I acted in an impromptu manner without thinking deeply? Now that the situation was getting better, I needed to be more cautious. It felt like numerous threads were tangled in front of me that could be ruined with my rash behavior.</p><p>‘I already have a lot of stats at level 1, so there is absolutely no reason to distribute my stat points hastily.’</p><p>I thought about the most important thing to me right now. It was…</p><p>“Money!”</p><p>Yes, money. I needed to make enough money in order to pay for the carriage to move between villages. Smith flinched as I suddenly shouted. I cut straight to the point,</p><p>“Didn’t I say it when I first visited your smithy? I want to make and sell high-demand items that will make me as much profit as possible. What is the most appropriate item?”</p><p>Smith pointed to a place where arrows were displayed.</p><p>“This one.”</p><p>An arrow?</p><p>Unlike other equipment, arrows were consumables, so the price of it was naturally cheaper. No matter how profitable it was, if the sale price was low, it meant that I had to sell a lot of volume. My spirit deflated.</p><p>Smith read my expression and explained,</p><p>“This isn’t an ordinary arrow. It is a special arrow made by mixing a small amount of jaffa with steel, allowing it to ignore some of the enemy’s defense and cause damage.”</p><p>Ignore defense!</p><p>For archers who participated in the Guardian of the Forest raise, these arrows were essential. No, even if it were for players not participating in the raid, the demand would be high considering there were many golems living in the Grey Forest.</p><p>“Jaffa…”</p><p>Smith saw that I was interested and brought out a light purple mineral from the warehouse.</p><p>“Jaffa is a mineral with a low oxygen content, making it easy to smelt, and is remarkably superior to iron. Its weakness is its durability and strength, making it unsuitable to create weapons with jaffa. However, when mixed with steel, the durability increases and the penetration power is maximized. It is normal for cavalry troops to be armed with jaffa-tipped spears. </p><p>“It must be expensive.”</p><p>“It is two gold per kilogram. Even top-tier iron ore is just cheap stone in front of jaffa.”</p><p>“Expensive… Then, how can you produce dozens of jaffa arrows?”</p><p>“No, it isn’t expensive. Only a small amount of jaffa is needed to create the arrow. The production cost of a single jaffa arrow is three silver, but the sales price is fixed at six silver. It is double the profit. In addition, this village has a high demand for jaffa arrows. How about it, do you want to learn how to make it?”</p><p>If this were yesterday, I would’ve nodded since I could gain a quick understanding through the appraisal skill. But I wasn’t the same. After receiving a recommendation for a suitable item, I needed to learn how to make it myself.</p><p>“Show me the arrow for a moment.”</p><p>Smith handed me the arrow and I used the appraisal skill.</p><p></p><p>[Jaffa Arrow] </p><p>Rating: Normal</p><p>Attack Power: 20~26</p><p>An arrow made by mixing a small amount of jaffa with steel. </p><p>Due to the effect of combining jaffa with steel, it has extremely high penetration and ignores some of the enemy’s defense. </p><p>Weight: 0.1 </p><p></p><p>[A hidden function doesn’t exist.]</p><p>[You have grasped the Jaffa Arrow’s material composition, production method, and intentions of its creator.]</p><p>[Your understanding of the Jaffa Arrow is now at 89%. You will be able to use the Jaffa Arrow skillfully.]</p><p></p><p>“……”</p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t reach 100% understanding after using appraisal on the Jaffa Arrow. Therefore, the production method wasn’t added.</p><p>‘This arrow…’</p><p>Smith looked at me staring at the arrow and asked again,</p><p>“Do you want to learn how to make the Jaffa Arrow?”</p><p>‘If I use the item disassembly skill, I might be able to raise the remaining 11%… But one arrow is six silver?’</p><p>I would need to pay six silver if I wanted to disassemble it. I couldn’t afford that type of luxury. </p><p>‘It isn’t too bad to learn how to make it on my own.’</p><p>I nodded in agreement. “I will learn how to make it.”</p><p>Smith was happy. “I thought so. First, shall we learn how to smelt the mineral?”</p><p>Smith began with the structure of the old furnace commonly used by all blacksmiths in Satisfy, explaining in detail the elements necessary for the smelting process and the principles behind the process.</p><p>Blacksmith jargon and chemical terms sometimes popped up, but I didn’t feel confused. While Satisfy pursued realism, it was still a game so the barrier wasn’t set high in order to allow more people to enjoy it.  The blacksmith knowledge required by Satisfy was as easy to understand as the other classes.</p><p>In addition, I came prepared. I had been unable to connect after receiving a penalty for dying twice in one day, so I used the spare time to research blacksmithing. Smith’s lecture wasn’t much different from the smelting method I read about. Thus, it was easier to understand.</p><p>I realized the effect of preparation and review. It was fortunate that one of my friends from middle school had taught me the ‘preparation and review’ method.</p><p>‘But that guy wasn’t able to escape the second place ranking all through high school.’</p><p>He was a pitiful guy who maintained his second rank in high school, never being able to cross the wall of a classmate who claimed to ‘only study in class.’</p><p>On the day the results of the second semester final examinations were released, I was able to understand the feelings of my friend who stood on the rooftop and yelled ‘Why did a genius have to be born in the same year as me?’</p><p>There were many talented people that I could never catch up to, no matter how hard I tried.</p><p>‘But now things are different.’</p><p>I got a legendary class. This time, I would be the outstanding person. I would achieve as much as possible.  				</p>'),(276,12,'Chapter 17',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 17</p><p>I smiled as Smith finished the lecture.</p><p>“Is it difficult to understand with just words? If so, then I will demonstrate it for you.”</p><p>Smith poured in a certain ratio of iron, coke, and limestone before starting the blast furnace. (The fuel Coke, not the drink/drug) </p><p>As Smith’s face and upper body became soaked with sweat, he controlled the hot wind coming from the bottom of the furnace and started burning the coke. At this point, the iron ore was gradually turned into molten iron due to Smith’s reduction interactions. </p><p>The limestone reacted by separating the iron and into impurities to form slag. Smith alternated between filtering out the slag and maintaining the heat. The black debris gradually disappeared through holes at the bottom of the furnace, while the molten iron became increasingly orange.</p><p>When the iron solidified, it would become pig iron. Pig iron was very hard and brittle because it contained a lot of carbon. It wasn’t suitable for the crafting of weapons. In order to make it suitable for weaponsmithing, it was necessary to reduce the carbon content through a process called steelmaking.</p><p>Smith, who was quietly immersed in his task, asked, “Do you understand what smelting is now?”</p><p>I nodded and Smith sent me a satisfied expression.</p><p>“Now that you’ve seen it, jaffa is easy to smelt. The jaffa ores have fewer impurities and a lower melting point, making it easier to refine than iron ore. The ratio of jaffa to coke to limestone is 12:2:4.”</p><p></p><p>[Mineral Smelting] </p><p>Difficulty: E</p><p>Mineral smelting is the basis of production. Smith gives this job to you, who is dreaming of becoming a blacksmith.</p><p>Quest Clear Conditions: Succeed in smelting the jaffa ore.</p><p>Quest Reward: Affinity with Smith +30, experience +80, 300g of smelted jaffa.</p><p>Quest Failure: It isn’t easy to perfectly smelt minerals in the beginning. </p><p>Smith will understand if you fail. </p><p></p><p>There was no reason to refuse. I accepted the quest. </p><p>Smith prepared the furnace for me and added, “Don’t be bothered if you fail. It might’ve looked easy as you watched me smelt it, but in reality, it’s actually quite hard.”</p><p>I placed the ingredients in the furnace and put my feet on the bellows. At that moment, a translucent arrow appeared and pointed to one side of the bellows.</p><p>‘Is this the class compensation effect?’</p><p>I placed my foot exactly where the arrow pointed. The arrow pointed in another direction, where I aimed the bellows at. The arrow repeatedly blinked, giving me the appropriate tempo. In the end, I managed to heat up the furnace in five minutes, unlike Smith who barely managed it in 10 minutes.</p><p>Then a notification window popped up.</p><p></p><p>[You can sense the temperature due to the rapid changes in ambient temperature. 30 degrees. 31 degrees. 31.5 degrees. 32…]</p><p></p><p>The strange, yet unwelcome voice was heard in my mind.</p><p></p><p>[Pagma’s descendant is sensitive to changes in temperature. If there is a furnace in the vicinity, you can accurately measure the temperature inside the furnace.</p><p></p><p>I placed my hand over the furnace.</p><p></p><p>[700 degrees. 720 degrees. 740…]</p><p></p><p>The constantly rising temperature was displayed in the continuously updating notification window.</p><p>‘1,000 degrees.’</p><p>Iron ore was said to be suitable for smelting between temperatures of 1,150~1,250 degrees Celsius, but jaffa was suitable at around 950~1,000 degrees. As soon as the notification window read 1,000 degrees, I no longer needed to put effort into increasing the temperature.</p><p>The jaffa slowly melted down. Compared to iron ore, jaffa had a lower concentration of impurities, so its orange glow was strong from the beginning. I immersed myself in filtering out the impurities. The translucent arrow told me the direction to move the metal pipes, so I was able to do it more quickly and accurately than Smith.</p><p>Smith, who was concerned about whether I was doing well or not, became shocked as he checked my work.</p><p>“H-Heok! Cough! Cough cough!”</p><p>Smith was so surprised that he had trouble breathing. After a while, Smith barely regained stability and asked me in a trembling voice, “How are you so skilled at smelting?”</p><p>His complexion was so pale that I was worried the old man might fall down.</p><p>“Do you have experience smelting? This wasn’t your first time?”</p><p>“…It is my first time smelting…”</p><p>Smith looked like he saw a ghost.</p><p>“Huh… it is really ridiculous… This is a talent that can’t be represented. A person with no experience is better than his teacher. It’s like I’m dreaming. Are you the reincarnation of Pagma?”</p><p>The term ‘reincarnation of Pagma’ was the common term of praise for especially talented blacksmiths. It was usually the best praise! Any blacksmith would explode with joy if they heard that they were Pagma’s reincarnation.</p><p>However, I was different.</p><p>‘I’m not a reincarnation, but a descendant.’</p><p>In the meantime, the high purity molten jaffa was completed. </p><p></p><p>[Quest success!]</p><p></p><p>Smith smiled warmly and said,</p><p>“Absolutely wonderful! You are a great friend.”</p><p></p><p>[Affinity with Smith has risen by 30.]</p><p>[Experience has risen by 80.]</p><p>[Your level has risen.]</p><p></p><p>‘Good! Level 2!’</p><p>There was no greater joy than an easy level up. At one time, I was level 80. Now I was delighted at just reaching level 2. I was very worried about what would happen when my level reached the double digits. </p><p>“Bring it here.”</p><p>Smith poured the molten jaffa into the molten iron, mixing the two metals at a ratio of 1:12. Of course, this meant that for every single part of jaffa, there were 12 parts of iron. Smith placed the mixture in the furnace and started to heat it up again. He didn’t forget to mix it together. He mixed it a total of six times before finishing the process by pouring the molten solution into a mold that he had prepared. </p><p>We would have to wait 40 minutes for the molten solution to harden inside the mold. Meanwhile, Smith handed me some jaffa that had already been completed.</p><p>“This is the first time you’ve smelted metal, so I will give this to you as a memento.”</p><p></p><p>[3 pieces of jaffa have been acquired.]</p><p></p><p>One piece of jaffa weighed around 700 grams to 1 kilogram. 300 grams of jaffa were worth one gold, so it was a considerable reward for an E-grade quest.</p><p>‘Smith, this person is really great.’</p><p>I was liking this blacksmith more and more. Smith approached with a big hammer and started hitting the mold that the molten solution was poured into. In the mold, the hardened molten iron appeared in the shape of a thick wire.</p><p>Smith picked up the wire and placed it to one side, where there was another, smaller mold. He placed the wire on the mold and started hammering. After that was done, he used a grindstone to sharpen the edge.</p><p>After some careful work, a typical arrowhead with a sharp end was completed. Although it was thick and heavy, the end was very sharp and could penetrate armor with no difficulty. The completed jaffa arrowhead was then secured to a pre-created arrow shaft.</p><p>I watched the whole process from beginning to end, then a new notification window popped up.</p><p></p><p>[Your understanding of the Jaffa Arrow is now at 100%.

Can you make it?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Smith laughed heartily.</p><p>“Answering without hesitation… What great confidence. Like any weapon, particularly in arrows, balance is important. You need to balance the feathers, the arrowhead, and the shaft… If the arrows are even a little bit out of balance, they won’t be able to fly as far as they can possibly go. It is very delicate work. Even so, can you really make it? Despite only watching the production process once?”</p><p>“I can do it.”</p><p>“Hoh… then I will trust you again.”</p><p></p><p>[Create a Jaffa Arrow] </p><p>Difficulty: D</p><p>The process of mixing two metals is never easy. It requires delicacy to make an arrow.

I could also freely use the iron ore. This was all thanks to my incredibly high affinity with the blacksmith. If it were the previous me, I would’ve just accepted these materials.</p><p>“I appreciate the courtesy, but I will make the shafts myself.”</p><p>I returned the 100 arrow shafts, but Smith couldn’t understand my actions.</p><p>“Why bother? If it is because you feel burdened, there is no need to worry.”</p><p>Tsk tsk, so this was why he was just a beginner blacksmith.</p><p>“Are you going to support me with the shafts every time I make an arrow?”</p><p>“No, I can’t… Oh, so you will use this opportunity to learn how to make the shafts properly?”</p><p>“That’s right. If possible, please support me with the materials required to make the shaft.”</p><p>Smith shrugged and gave me some sturdy branches and good quality feathers. “I was so focused on the smelting and making of the arrowhead that I didn’t tell you how to make the shaft. I’ll teach you how to make the shaft now.”</p><p>There were limits to how much a beginner blacksmith could teach me. I told him I would take care of it and pulled out a thick booklet from my inventory. The title was ‘List of Items Production Methods.’</p><p>When I opened the book, I saw that four things were listed in the table of contents. They were the production methods of an axe, a pickaxe, the Jaffa Arrow, and ‘Failure’. It might be empty and simple now, but there will a day when this ‘List of Items Production Methods’ book will be filled up.</p><p>I opened the page on how to make a Jaffa arrow and read it. The method of making the shaft was described in detail, complete with pictures and text. I read it and read it again for a while before closing the book.</p><p>‘Okay, I can do it.’</p><p>I was a little tense since it was my first time making an item. No, I was more excited than tense. I started making the arrow shaft. First of all,  I straightened the branches into a straight line. The badly bent branches were lightly seared and then straightened.  I cut the branches to a regular length and cut the top (a U shaped groove where the arrow would be placed against the bowstring) of the shaft. Then I finished by pasting on feathers.</p><p>One, two, three.</p><p>As the number of completed shafts increased, my proficiency steadily grew. It was a great effect as it combined my high dexterity that enabled delicate work with the correction effect of my class.</p><p>Smith once again felt admiration as he watched.</p><p>“This isn’t the workmanship of a novice… You figured out the production method just by looking at the finished shaft? You truly have the eyes of a craftsman. The dexterity and accuracy are also excellent.”</p><p>I was able to finish 100 shafts without difficulty before I started making the arrowheads.  				</p>'),(277,12,'Chapter 18',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 18</p><p>I melted iron ore and jaffa together, mixing them in the right proportions. Then, I poured the molten iron into the mold. Then, after 40 minutes, I pounded it into the shape of a wire.  I poured a bucket of water on the wire.</p><p>Chiiiik!</p><p>A loud sound was heard as the scorching wire cooled rapidly. Quenching. This process increased the hardness and strength of the metal.</p><p>Smith seemed disappointed for the first time.</p><p>“You even know about quenching?”</p><p>“Yes. I have studied various production methods. I am a person who is always prepared.”</p><p>“Uhh, I don’t know what you studied, but is this the limit of self-study? Why are you using quenching when making the arrowhead? I’m not sure if you know, but if you quench the metal, it becomes harder and less durable. The moment the arrow strikes the enemy, instead of piercing the enemy, the arrowhead might break in the enemy’s armor.”</p><p>That was right, but I had a special plan.</p><p>“I’ll also use tempering.”</p><p>Tempering involved reheating the quenched metal and then gradually lowering it in order to decrease the metal’s brittleness. It was adding a flourish to the production method, which could strengthen the metal in the end. </p><p>However, it would take a lot of time to do all of this. It was labor that I didn’t like!</p><p>Smith frowned as he felt the same way.</p><p>“Do you intend to make the arrows all night? I don’t know why you would spend so much time making the arrows. Those who buy arrows consider them as a one-off consumable, so why are you so devoted to making the consumable item?”</p><p>Why?  The reason for increasing the amount of labor was simple. I replied while reheating the quenched wire and hammering at it,</p><p>“If I make it a bit better, I can sell it for a more expensive price.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Smith understood once he heard my words and no longer interfered. I made the arrowheads by repeatedly quenching, forging, and tempering.  How much time passed by?  I was tired and sore, but the heat from the smithy was even more painful. My awkward hammering skills steadily improved over time.</p><p></p><p>[Your persistence has risen.]</p><p>[Your dexterity has risen.]</p><p></p><p>My growing stats really made everything feel worthwhile. I was willing to do anything to raise my stats. </p><p>“…This.”</p><p>Dammit! It was labor in the game! But it was also fun!</p><p>“I will become addicted to labor one day!”</p><p>Would a day come when I enjoyed labor in reality as well? It was a big deal. I might end up with osteoporosis in my later years of life.</p><p>Ttang! Ttang!</p><p>I complained but still immersed myself in the actions. The wire was slowly converted into an arrowhead as my hammering and my skills became more sophisticated.</p><p>“Hoo. Hoo.”</p><p>I took short breaths. My arms were numb and my skin was hot, but I endured it. My concentration increased as my stamina fell.</p><p></p><p>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience skill has been activated. Concentration, stamina, and defense will rise to the extremes for one hour.]</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the weariness in my body disappeared and I felt refreshed. This was similar to the vigor I felt whenever I ate cereal with milk.</p><p>“Ohhhhhh!”</p><p>I alternated between the hammer and metals, producing the arrowheads. The effect of my increased concentration was noticeable in the arrowheads. It might’ve been because I made it myself, but the arrowheads were really beautiful. </p><p>I was happy. Sweating in front of the fire gave me a sense of fulfillment.</p><p>‘This isn’t mere labor. Rather, it is akin to art.’</p><p>In reality, I had no talent so I felt no pleasure no matter what I did. I had to work my guts off just to fall behind. But now I had talent. It was a talent that could only be shown in Satisfy, but it was enough. </p><p>Ttang! Ttang!</p><p>A harmony with the hammer!

But arrows were cheap and considered consumables, so the profit of an epic rated arrow was limited. I was overcome with bad emotions.</p><p>‘Dammit! He should’ve told me to make either sword or armor!’</p><p>I started to hate Smith, who recommended the Jaffa Arrow. When I looked at the arrow I made, the short feeling of admiration turned into anger.</p><p>“You haven’t gone through an apprenticeship yet you are already making something so great! Ideal arrows! This is the first time that I’ve considered an arrow to be beautiful! You are definitely Pagma’s reincarnation! Ahh! You must be tired of my surprise by now! You are great! Amazing! Wonderful!”</p><p>I regained my spirit at Smith’s words.</p><p>Yes, the first item I made had an epic rating. I didn’t even fail. This fact was enough for me to rejoice and be thankful. As a result of making the epic rated items, all of my stats increased by 4 and my reputation increased. </p><p>In addition, the performance of the arrows was amazing. Were there any existing arrows whose attack power exceeded 40? Plus, there was a special option.</p><p>‘One arrow is better than a level 20 hand weapon.’</p><p>Arrows were less profitable than other equipment items due to their nature, but this great performance meant that I would definitely get some money.</p><p>‘I was a little confused because something bigger than I planned emerged.’</p><p>I had the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship skill. Due to the effect, the abilities of all my items increased by 10%. In others words, the basic attack power of a Jaffa Arrow was 20~26, but the ones I created would be 22~28. From a buyer’s point of view, they would rather buy the Jaffa Arrows from me rather than the general Jaffa Arrows. </p><p>But they would be reluctant to pay more. Why? It didn’t make sense to pay more money just for a slight increase in attack power. So I used quenching, forging, and tempering as a way to maximize the effects of my skill. I expected that a fairly good arrow would emerge from a 10% increase in performance plus a more elaborate production process.</p><p>Then the finished arrows had a better performance than my expectations due to the breath skill. I made Jaffa Arrows that had 15 more attack power than existing Jaffa Arrows, and it also had the option of completely ignoring the enemy’s defense. A high-level user would purchase the Jaffa Arrows I made, no matter how expensive they were. It was well worth it.</p><p>“Pu~~~~~~ hahahahat!!”</p><p>The superior stats and skills possessed by Pagma’s Descendant. The 40 stat points obtained through the minus levels! My stats also increased from making epic rated items. Finally, the arrows that could be sold at an expensive price. I could be certain that today was the best day of my life.</p><p>“It is better than my birthday.”</p><p>Besides, there was only my little sister who remembered my birthday. It was annoying to hear on my birthday things like ‘Are you sitting alone at home again?’ or ‘Don’t you have any friends?’ This year, I should say those words on my sister’s birthday.</p><p>Therefore, it was natural to be one hundred times happier today compared to my embarrassing and lonely birthdays.</p><p>Smith watched me laughing like a madman and handed over the 100 completed Jaffa Arrows.</p><p>“I originally promised you half of this… but I can’t take such wonderful things. I want you to take all of them.”</p><p>The effect of maximum affinity! Wasn’t this a beautiful favor? </p><p>My heart thumped. Smith seemed just like my grandfather so I couldn’t help embracing him.</p><p>“You have shown me great kindness! It was a short meeting but I will never forget you.”</p><p>Tears dripped from Smith’s eyes as he hugged me. “Are you leaving already? That’s too bad.”</p><p>“We might meet again someday if we’re lucky.”</p><p>“I don’t want you to leave…” Smith glanced at me with a flushed face. </p><p>Like a male peacock opening its colorful tail feathers to seduce a female, he tried to attract me using hammers, tongs, and the solid muscles of his upper body. This man, he had the smell of a widower so he must’ve been alone for a long time. Maybe he was so lonely that he became gay after his affinity towards me reached the maximum…?  No, he might’ve been gay from the beginning.</p><p>His dignity decreased in front of his affection. I straightened and let go.</p><p>“Then I’m going now.”</p><p>I grabbed the 100 epic arrows and hurriedly moved away. However, due to the 100% reduction in movement speed, I couldn’t leave the blacksmith quickly. Smith approached me and hugged me from behind.</p><p>“I can see that you also don’t want to separate from me! You are thinking of me in that passionate heart of yours. I’m reluctant to give up this affection. I won’t forget you until the day I lay in my coffin! No, I will think of you, even in my coffin!”</p><p>“This damn person.

The face of Jishuka, the leader of the party, didn’t look good as she searched through the remains of the Guardian of the Forest.</p><p>“Idiots, what were you paying attention to?”</p><p>Jishuka had already thoroughly lectured the party members about the precautions and strategies before confronting the Guardian of the Forest. But that hard work was for nothing, as nobody followed it save for a few of her guild members. Therefore, it was frustrating for her.</p><p>“I’d rather die than live with the judgment and learning ability of a monkey.”</p><p>The guild’s reputation would become worse because of the party members’ deaths.</p><p>“Che.”</p><p>Despite her disapproval, she was the genius who saved the lives of her party members with every pull of her bowstring.

Jishuka checked the items dropped by the Guardian of the Forest and was unable to hide her disappointment. The other party members also sighed.</p><p>They had fought against the Guardian of the Forest and the golems for two days, and when the guardian was finally defeated, they were disturbed by new golems.</p><p>The loot was tacky compared to such suffering. 30 iron ores, 7 orichalcum ores, and 1 blue orichalcum ore.</p><p>Regas shrugged. “The Amethyst Shield didn’t emerge again this time.”</p><p>The Tzedakah Guild constantly challenged the Guardian of the Forest raid once every two weeks in order to get the Amethyst Shield.

They barely avoided a deficit. There were no complaints from the guild members, but the general users complained about the small compensation.</p><p>But what could they do? This was the result.</p><p>Jishuka disbanded the party and gathered the guild members. Then she spoke with a serious expression.</p><p>“This is already the fourth raid without any success.

But that wouldn’t continue to work.</p><p>Toban, the level 172 paladin and the guild’s chief of staff, nodded.</p><p>“I need the Amethyst Shield for a linked quest, but it can’t be helped. For the time being, we have to give up on the Guardian of the Forest raid and try to strengthen the guild’s power.”</p><p>Vantner, the 2nd ranked person on the guardian knight rankings, wasn’t armed with a shield despite choosing a defensive class.

In the meantime, we will improve our level and equipment. If we gain 15 levels in the next three months, can’t we kill that guy? Regas, you should gain 20 levels.”</p><p>Jishuka laughed brightly. Her half-moon eyes were sexy; however, they were considered horrifying to the guild members. Their leader was scary. If they didn’t fulfill the goal, they really would experience hell. The guild members, who knew better than anyone how fierce Jishuka was, gulped and Regas cried out in a trembling voice.</p><p>“Let’s go train!”</p><p>Thus, the Tzedakah Guild discretely dispersed.  </p><p>Jishuka headed to the guild warehouse alone.

Jishuka swept up all the arrows on the list. She didn’t care about money.  She invested the money obtained from being a top ranker and pinpointed exactly where she should use it. </p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Jishuka confirmed the bid price for the Jaffa Arrows at the bottom of the list and frowned. It was the only one without an immediate purchase price set. There was also a total of 99 bids, with the top bid at 18 silver.</p><p>Jishuka wondered why some madman would bid three times the price of a Jaffa Arrow, but then she noticed that the name of the arrows was purple, not white.</p><p>‘Did I see it incorrectly?’ </p><p>She blinked but it was still purple.

It was annoying to carry the tiles if I met a bad tiler and I had to be careful not to break the tiles, but it was decent work.</p><p>I raised my hand. “Here! I have carried tiles more than 10 times… Ugh!”</p><p>I was once again pushed back into a corner by the older men and lost the chance to be hired because there were three people more experienced than me.</p><p>“Anyone else?”</p><p>“Here! I do… Ack!”</p><p>There were several companies looking for laborers, but I wasn’t hired due to the continuous interference.</p><p>“Ah, you! You will regret not seeing my value!”</p><p>The older men in the workforce were hindering me. It seemed that they didn’t like me snatching away their spots.</p><p>“Who could come here because they like it? Don’t you think I want to work part-time like other young people? I’m making a living just like you! Let me get something as well!”</p><p>The mere sight of them was enough to make me angry, like seeing a barking dog. However, my opponents were adults. So, I couldn’t say anything bad and sat down again. </p><p>“Kukuk.” The chief, who had been reading his newspaper on his desk, looked at me.</p><p>Was he around his early 30s? He was a person who inherited this office from his father. For every 10 times I came here looking for a job, I’d gone home three times in vain. The chief was watching me when another person arrived.</p><p>“Who can do electric pulling work? No experience is needed. I will pay 110,000 won a day, so come quickly.”</p><p>It was 20,000 won more than the usual pay. However, I didn’t move. Of course, there was a reason for offering more money. </p><p>‘I can’t forget how awful it was.’</p><p>I’d tried electrical cable pulling only once. </p><p>It was just pulling a huge electrical cable, so it was a very simple task. However, it consumed a tremendous amount of stamina. I couldn’t let the cable hit my wrist. Moreover, the cables were very thick and the weight was heavy. </p><p>It was just pulling, but… I would get blisters on my hands even while wearing gloves, and I would suffer from muscle aches for at least two days. </p><p>‘It was an oasis in winter…’</p><p>I still remembered the nightmare from last winter. The other men present looked into the distance, whistled or went out to smoke.</p><p>“No one?” The man asked again with an awkward expression.</p><p>Then one of the middle-aged men pointed towards me. “This young man can do it very well.”</p><p>“Really. He is very active and has amazing stamina.”</p><p>“Hasn’t he done a lot of electrical cable pulling? An expert, expert.”</p><p>‘These insane humans!’</p><p>I glared at them to stop, but the other men continued to recommend me. Then the person offering the job pointed to me. “Excuse me, young man. Shall we go together? You look very good.”</p><p>If I followed the atmosphere, today I would enter hell. I glanced towards the chief, but he just smiled. In the end, I raise my phone to my ear, like I had received an incoming call.</p><p>“Yes, this is Shin Youngwoo. Ah, there was a spot? Yes, right away…”</p><p>Ddiririring ~ ddiririring~</p><p>“……”</p><p>The default S Corporation’s ringtone was heard from the phone at my ear. In the end, the other workers there laughed until tears emerged from their eyes. The employer also laughed. “Then let’s go.”</p><p>Who would call me this early in the morning? Moreover, I barely ever received phone calls. So, how did I receive a call at this exact timing? Then I belatedly saw the caller ID and hurriedly picked up the phone. It was an unforgettable voice.</p><p>(Hello~ This is Mother’s Heart is Happy Financial Services. Customer Shin Youngwoo, you do know that the deadline is tomorrow right?)</p><p>“…Already?”</p><p>(If you have forgotten, does that mean there is no money?)</p><p>“O-Of course not. Yes, I understand. I will have the amount ready for tomorrow.”</p><p>(Thank you, Debt… no, Customer. Have a happy day. Mother’s Heart is Happy hopes you will smile today~)</p><p>The call ended.</p><p>“This damn…”</p><p>I’d played games and ignored reality, forgetting that I was a debtor. I had to work hard to pay off the interest. It would be hard work, not easy work, that would get me out of this position.</p><p>“Excuse me… Will you really pay 110,000 won?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Is it really true?”</p><p>“Of course! You will never go hungry when working for me!”</p><p>I eventually left towards hell. That evening…</p><p>“O-Oppa?” Se-hee stammered when she saw my exhausted self return home. I couldn’t even take my shoes off before collapsing.</p><p>“Shit… The words were true, but… doing all that labor only to receive cream bread…? There wasn’t even milk…! What type of people would give cream bread and no milkkkkkk?!!! U-Ughhh… I have to play the game… Arrows… sold…”</p><p>I couldn’t remember anything after that. It was because I fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>* * *</p><p>When I woke up, I felt like I had been crushed by steel. My body was throbbing all over, and I barely managed to check the time. It was 5.20 a.m.</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>This was serious. It was late when I took into consideration the distance between my house and the labor office. I hurried to change into my work clothes while worrying about getting a good job. If I arrived late, then something like yesterday might happen again.</p><p>“Ack~! I’m going.”</p><p>After I paid the interest for the loan, I would only have 9,220 won in my hands. I needed to make money to pay the fee for the game in a week. As I put on my shoes without washing up, my mother approached and patted my shoulder. “Come eat breakfast.”</p><p>“I can’t. I’m already late,” I replied hurriedly.</p><p>“Youngwoo,” my mother suddenly said my name in a serious voice. I cowered reflexively. It was obvious that her nagging would begin. My mother knew about my debts. She wondered why I was addicted to games and was saddened by my absence from school. She mourned that I had debts and was living in this situation.</p><p>However, when I looked back, my mother’s eyes were calm and welcoming.</p><p>“Come eat,” she said.</p><p>“W-why? I have to go to the office quickly.”</p><p>At that moment, the door opened, and my father appeared. My father sat at the table, opened the newspaper and said quietly, “Take a break today.”</p><p>“A break? What are you saying.”</p><p>“Cough, cough.” My father just coughed and looked at the newspapers. </p><p>My mother whispered in my ears, “You came back really exhausted yesterday. Your father was worried since he carried you to your bedroom~”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“We are your mother and father. We don’t want to see our son suffer. Didn’t you suffer yesterday? You should rest for today.”</p><p>“M-Mother…” I was touched by the fact that my parents were still looking after me, despite all the disappointment I’d caused them in the past year.</p><p>At that time, Sehee exited her room with a yawn and handed me something. It was a pain relief patch.</p><p>“Paste it on. Didn’t you go through a lot of trouble yesterday?”</p><p>“S-Sehee…”</p><p>‘Ahh! What a beautiful family!’</p><p>I cried out as I embraced my mother and Sehee. </p><p>I’d thought I was alone in this difficult world, but I had such warm family beside me. My family members were like angels to their disappointing son and brother. I was truly grateful to have this family.</p><p>“W-What? Who are you hugging? O-Oppa’s hug is good… Ah, no. Isn’t it bad?” Sehee grumbled quietly as she hugged me back, while my mother quietly stroked my head. After that, I took off my work clothes and sat at the table, feeling the taste of beef rib soup for the first time in months.</p><p>“Father, then can you pay off my debt?”</p><p>Beeok! My father, who was eating quietly, gazed at me and threw his spoon. I shrieked as it hit me in the forehead, while my mother clicked her tongue and handed my father a new spoon.</p><p>“Haven’t I already told you? We want you to be self-reliant. You are already 26 years old. You should be responsible for your own actions.”</p><p>The atmosphere had been so full of harmony that I never imagined a spoon would fly over. As I rubbed my forehead, my father handed me an envelope.</p><p>He said, “I will give you an allowance for today. You are resting today because of us, so I can’t let you make a loss.” </p><p>“Father…” I was touched. My usually blunt father was taking care of me today. I would gladly accept the allowance. </p><p>‘Then…’</p><p>I grasped the number of bills in the envelope with my sharp fingertips, but the number seemed a little small? When I looked inside the envelope, I saw seven bills. Feeling disappointed, I spoke carefully, “Father, the minimum payment for labor these days is at least 9…”</p><p>My father looked at me regretfully. “Huh, really? I’m sorry, but that is all the cash I have on me right now. Be satisfied with that.”</p><p>He was telling me not to ask for the missing amount later. I had forgotten, but my father was quite restrained when it came to spending money. If he bought a chicken, he thought that the family should eat it over three meals.</p><p>I was forced to surrender at receiving an allowance of 70,000 won. </p><p>‘At least he gave it in the first place.’  				</p>'),(280,12,'Chapter 21',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 21</p><p>After breakfast, my parents immediately headed towards the vegetable store that they ran. The two of them normally left at 5 a.m, so they were quite late today.</p><p>‘They are late because of breakfast with their son.’</p><p>I suddenly felt that tsunami of emotions again as tears filled my eyes. It was the first time my stomach felt so full in a while. </p><p>I sat on the couch and dozed off, before waking up because of Sehee. Sehee had changed into her school uniform and looked like a neat schoolgirl. She was my sister, but I had to admit that she was beautiful.</p><p>“What? Why are you looking at me like that?”</p><p>“I’m glad to see you. You grew up well.”</p><p>“W-What are you saying all of a sudden!?” Sehee flushed red before hitting my forearm.</p><p>‘What? Did I do something wrong? But what is this cool feeling?’</p><p>I felt some relief in the area that Sehee had hit. It was like a massage!</p><p>“Ahh, good! Hit me more! More! Keep hitting.”</p><p>“Kyaaak! Pervert!”</p><p>Slap!</p><p>…Why did she slap me all of a sudden? I placed a hand on my tingling cheek as Sehee shouted, “I’ve filled up the tub with hot water. Then your body will feel better. This perverted Oppa!”</p><p>“Ah, eh, yes…”</p><p>She was someone who got angry at me but always took care of me.</p><p>‘But why am I a pervert?’</p><p>Sehee headed to school while I soaked in the hot water.</p><p>“My fatigue is going away.”</p><p>Then after a few moments…</p><p>I exited the bathroom and paid the loan interest through a direct account transfer. It was hard to bear seeing the money from my blood and sweat disappear before my eyes.</p><p>“Ugh… This world is hell…”</p><p>I needed stability. So, I hurriedly entered the capsule and connected to Satisfy.</p><p>‘How much have the arrows sold for?’</p><p>“Login.”</p><p>Jiing.</p><p>The capsule’s door closed, and my field of view slowly turned black. Then the familiar system voice and music entered my eyes, then my vision brightened again.</p><p>“The air is good.”</p><p>I appeared in a place which reminded me of a charming village in medieval Europe and immediately stated a command, “Status window.”</p><p></p><p>Name: Grid </p><p>Level: 3 (75/500)</p><p>Class: Pagma’s Descendant</p><p>* The probability of adding additional options when making items will increase.</p><p>* The probably of item enhancement will increase. </p><p>* All equipment items can be worn unconditionally. </p><p> However, there is a penalty depending on the rating of the item. </p><p>Title: One who Became a Legend</p><p>* Abnormal conditions don’t work well for you.</p><p>* You won’t die when health is at the minimum.</p><p>* Easily acknowledged.</p><p>Health: 336/336    Mana: 87/87</p><p>Strength: 24 + 5   Stamina: 22   Agility: 16  Intelligence: 29 </p><p>Dexterity: 55  Persistence: 21</p><p>Composure: 14  Indomitable: 16   Dignity: 14   Insight: 14</p><p>Stat Points: 60</p><p>Weight: 3,095/1,000</p><p>* The weight limit exceeds 200%, so movement speed is reduced by 100%. </p><p>The body is heavy and cannot exert any power properly. </p><p>The probability of receiving the ‘weakened’ state has become really high.</p><p></p><p>“Level 3… Huhu, is that really the case?” </p><p>My stats had increased by making an epic rated item. Considering the 60 stat points which I hadn’t used yet, I was actually around level 26. If I equipped Mamon’s Greatsword and Mengel’s Plate Armor, I could demonstrate the combat power of a level 50.</p><p>“Is this the feeling of superiority that only a special person can feel? Huhuhut…”</p><p>In a square filled with people, I forgot the harshness of reality as I talked excitedly to myself. Then with one hand on my hip, I laughed like the protagonist of a movie. The women passing by sent me dirty looks and gossiped with each other.</p><p>“What is with that person? Striking such a strange pose and laughing while talking to himself.”</p><p>“Is he on an ego trip? Perhaps he has the prince disease?”</p><p>“He is ugly. He probably doesn’t have a lover.”</p><p>Normally, I would be unhappy, but right now, I was so thrilled that I didn’t care about the gazes of others. I ignored what they were saying and checked the experience of my various skills.</p><p></p><p>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill] Lv 1 (3.7%)</p><p>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath] Lv 1 (2.0%) </p><p></p><p>I’d thought it would take longer for the experience of these skills to rise. </p><p>‘Is it thanks to making an epic item?’</p><p>I headed to the auction house with a light heart. As usual, the auction house was bustling with people.</p><p>“I wonder what the winning bid is…”</p><p>The price for one Jaffa Arrow was six silver. However, the Jaffa Arrows I’d made had an epic rating! I expected the price to be 3~4 times higher. </p><p>In the case of general equipment items, it was reasonable to calculate that rare-rated items would be three times more expensive than normal items, while epic items would be seven times more expensive than normal items.</p><p>However, I soon became worried. Would even a rich user want to spend so much money buying arrows? In the first place, consumables were cheap compared to equipment items.</p><p>‘Yes, don’t expect too much.’</p><p>I opened the auction window while thinking that I would be satisfied if they sold for double the price. Then…</p><p>“K-Keok…!”</p><p>After confirming the bidding price of the Jaffa Arrows, I couldn’t shut my mouth. Meanwhile, I could hear the voices of the women looking at me.</p><p>“Isn’t he that person laughing to himself in the square? Oh. my. What is he doing now? His mouth has fallen open.”</p><p>“Kyaaak~! His saliva is dripping! Nasty!”</p><p>“Ugly… He must have no lover.”</p><p>“Argh… Uhhh…”</p><p>I tried to shut my mouth, but it wasn’t easy.</p><p></p><p>[Special Jaffa Arrow] (99 Pieces)</p><p>[Bid Price: 72 silver per piece.] </p><p></p><p>It sold for 12 times the price of ordinary Jaffa Arrows!</p><p>“Eh…uh…aack…”</p><p>I touched the inventory with trembling hands, then I took out the calculator which was a default item provided to all users. 99×72=?</p><p>“…7,128…”</p><p>100 silver was 1 gold. 7,128 silver meant 71 gold and 28 silver. For reference, 100 gold was worth around 120,000 won in cash.</p><p>‘Didn’t I create 100 arrows in around a day?’</p><p>It was approximately a day in game time. If I calculated it in real time, I’d earned around 84,000 won in less than six hours.</p><p>“Ha…hahaha…”</p><p>I was thrilled. Uncontrollable laughter emerged from my mouth, “Puhahahahat!”</p><p>“T-That person has finally gone mad!”</p><p>“Ugly! He definitely doesn’t have a lover! His mother must be the only female contact in his phone.”</p><p>‘Cough, do their words have to be so sharp?’</p><p>No, I wouldn’t be shaken by these females.</p><p>‘Talk in your hearts.’ </p><p>At this moment, I could still smile even while hearing such shameful words.</p><p>‘I can see a definite way.’</p><p>Debt?</p><p>“I will pay it back in the game!”</p><p>There was no need to go find labor jobs. It was more profitable to make money from the items I create in the game. Indeed, Pagma’s Descendant was definitely a goose that lay golden eggs.</p><p>I formed a fist and shivered, while the auctioneer at the counter handed me gold and silver coins. However, why was the amount of money lacking?</p><p>“Why are you only giving me 60 gold and 59 silver?”</p><p>The auction house manager smiled at my question.</p><p>“The amount is limited to 10 gold and 69 silver because of the sales commission. There is a 15% sales commission for epic rated items. Thank you for using our service.”</p><p>The commission fee was 8% for normal rated items and 10% for rare rated items. Compared to that, the sales commission for epic rated items was too expensive.</p><p>‘How much is the commission fee for unique or legendary rated items?’ </p><p>Suddenly, the auction house and Mother’s Heart is Happy seemed to overlap. Exploitation was the same in reality and in Satisfy.</p><p>“Shit… I will become a successful person who exploits the weak…”</p><p>I would produce legendary items which weren’t possible for anyone else except Pagma’s Descendant! The two billion users in Satisfy would be overwhelmed!</p><p>“But that is a story for the distant future. Ugh!”</p><p>Tears flowed as I thought about the 15% commission. This was because the day before, I hadn’t been able to open a stall because I’d needed to go work, so I had decided to use the auction house. </p><p>Once I got the money, I thought about whether I should take the carriage to Winston Village or not.</p><p>‘I can stay here and make a lot of money with the Jaffa Arrows, so do I really need to move villages?’</p><p>I was trying to move villages because I wanted to find a suitable hunting ground. However, I didn’t need to cling to hunting and leveling up, when I could make a profit by making items.</p><p>‘It would be good to just stay here and make items all the time…’</p><p>However, there was one thing I had to consider. It was the fact that Smith was gay!</p><p>‘If I stay here alone with him… Just imagining it was terrible.’</p><p>I wasn’t in a hurry to hunt now, but I would be more comfortable living in a village suitable for my level. In the end, I decided to move to Winston as planned and headed towards the carriages. Just like last time, I started negotiating the price while armed with the saddest stories.</p><p>“My ailing sister is waiting for me in Winston Village…”</p><p>“Oh, no! Then I will leave one hour early. Climb into my carriage!” </p><p>“But right now, I only have seven gold…”</p><p>“Oh, I thought you were a customer with a reservation. I’m sorry.”</p><p>My first bargaining attempt failed!</p><p>“My grandmother died the day before I was born, and her death anniversary is today. I needed to go to Winston Village right now, but I only have 7 gold and 50 silver…”</p><p>“Um, I want to help you because of your high reputation and your situation, but it is too much of a loss to visit Winston VIllage for 7 gold and 50 silver. I’m sorry.”</p><p>My second bargaining attempt failed. It was the same as humans constantly stepping on other humans. </p><p>“You should give me a choco pie, ah, these people. You should realize that we are all the same!”</p><p>In the end, I failed to negotiate the price I wanted, but I got on the carriage that was the cheapest.</p><p>“Let’s depart for Winston. It should be a quick and safe trip, considering the money I paid. And be friendly! You should show full hospitality.”</p><p>“…I will be very grateful if you didn’t talk.”</p><p>Travelling always made people excited. The bumpy carriage ride and the unfriendly attitude of the coachman were bad, but my mood was good.  				</p>'),(281,12,'Chapter 22',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 22</p><p>The carriage departed in the afternoon and arrived at Winston Village on the morning of the next day. Winston Village was unusually large for its name. Four times larger and more active than Bairan Village, Winston Village was comparable to the fortified city of Patrian!</p><p>As I paid the coachman 8 gold and 90 silver, I asked for proper customer service from him.</p><p>“I have one question.”</p><p>“Ask me. I will tell you what I can.”</p><p>“Why isn’t Winston called a city?”</p><p>“Originally, it was a village smaller than Bairan. However, there are many places suitable for beginner and intermediate level travelers nearby. As these places became famous, the number of visitors gradually increased. There is a rumor that it will be upgraded to a city in the near future if this trend continues. I heard that Earl Steim’s heir will be sent as the new lord… It will be called a city by then. But I don’t know exactly when that will be.”</p><p>‘Earl Steim? Where have I heard that name before?’</p><p>I was having a hard time remembering since I’d experienced so many things at all once.</p><p>“Well, it has nothing to do with me anyway.”</p><p>‘Now, shall I begin?’</p><p>I headed to the warehouse administration. After I informed the manager of the registration number and password to my warehouse, the administrator extended his hand. It meant to give him a tip.</p><p>‘Dammit. I have to pay just to use the warehouse?’</p><p>I handed over 30 silver with trembling hands. The administrator checked the amount and started to chant a spell while drawing a small circle with a magic wand. Then a small warehouse was summoned before me using space and teleport magic.</p><p>The warehouse was empty. I’d had sold all my japtem in order to buy potions for Ashur’s three month quest. Since its early days, I had played Satisfy for one year, but there was only dust in my warehouse now.</p><p>“Ugh… in reality and in the game…”</p><p>I opened my inventory with frustration.</p><p></p><p>[Mamon’s Greatsword] </p><p>[Rating: Epic</p><p>Durability: 88/204   Attack Power: 178~301   Attack Speed: -16%</p><p>-Additional water damage will be added to all critical attacks.</p><p>This is the greatsword patronized by the guardian of Lake Pamian, Mamon.

Therefore, I didn’t know something like a repair tool was needed.</p><p>‘It’s no wonder why the repairs were so expensive!’</p><p>I could postpone repairing the items until next time. However, this was a warehouse which I had wasted 30 silver to open. If I closed the warehouse and went to buy the repair tool, 30 silver would fly away!</p><p>Ultimately, I shook off my fury and left Mamon’s Greatsword and Mengel’s Plate Armor in the warehouse anyway. The equipment storage fee was 10 silver per item. This was a terrifying expenditure. </p><p>“The world is a thief…”</p><p>Spending 30 silver to open the warehouse and then 10 silver to place an item inside it…! Mother’s Heart is Happy, the auction house and the warehouse administrators, they were all crooks in my eyes.</p><p>“My 50 silver… My 50 silver…!”</p><p>50 silver was 600 won in cash. That was enough to buy 200 milliliters of milk, which could relieve my thirst and make my bones sturdy at the same time. I stored the two items which weighed a considerable amount.</p><p>“Kuuack…”</p><p>My hands shook.  After glaring at the warehouse administrator who politely said farewell to me, I headed towards the square.</p><p>There was a wide range of people in the square, from newbies who had just created their characters to users wearing level 100 equipment.</p><p>People were moving around in order to adapt to the virtual reality. There were people looking for a party, buying or selling goods, sharing quests, beggars, couples, and people who simply enjoyed the landscape. All types of people were seen.</p><p>I stood still and observed them.</p><p>The beginner users were mainly using East Street, while the average-level users were mainly using South Street. The West and North Streets were favored by everyone, regardless of level.</p><p>East Street contained NPCs who gave beginner quests and led to the most suitable hunting grounds for them. Meanwhile, the south had the suitable quests and hunting grounds for average-level users. The west and north were areas which covered all levels, or basically, the area crowded with stores.</p><p>“The blacksmith is likely to be in the west or north.”</p><p>As I came to this conclusion while observing the people, a notification window popped up.</p><p></p><p>[Insight has increased by 1.]</p><p></p><p>The insight stat could be used to detect objects or predict risks. However, I hadn’t seen its performance yet, so I didn’t know if this stat was really useful.</p><p>“Well, any increase is good.”</p><p>I didn’t feel much inspiration as I explored West Street and East Street. However, I then found a blacksmith on East Street. The exterior of the building was huge. </p><p>It was a two-story building, making it incomparable to the small smithy in Bairan Village. Unlike Smith who worked alone in Bairan Village, this smithy seemed like it would have dozens of blacksmiths working together.</p><p>‘The leader of dozens of blacksmiths should be at least an intermediate level blacksmith?’</p><p>If so, he would recognize me and treat me favorably. Unlike Bairan Village, I would learn how to make items in a good environment. I entered the smithy excitedly while imagining the energetic sound of hammering and the hot heat.</p><p>However, the smithy I entered seemed bleak. I couldn’t hear any hammering sounds, and there were no indications of any people about.</p><p>“W-What?” I looked around in a confused manner and saw a pot-bellied man sleeping in a corner with an empty alcohol bottle beside him. I didn’t know if he was sleeping or dead, so I approached him quietly and shook him awake.</p><p>“Hey. Hey!”</p><p>“…Eh? What?”</p><p>Fortunately, he wasn’t dead.  The pot-bellied man made an expression of annoyance and opened his eyes.  Then he turned towards me and asked, “What did you come here for?”</p><p>“I want to learn how to make the best selling item in this village. Can I get your help?”</p><p>The elderly man looked at me with a ridiculing expression. “This place ended a long time ago. After the Mero Company bought the blacksmith stores and commercial areas, they bulk sell items at a low price so the customers turned away from this place. Yet you came here to learn how to make items? Are you sure you want to perish with me?”</p><p>Right at that moment…</p><p>The smithy door opened, and a group of rough looking people rushed in.</p><p>“Hey, Old Man! You still haven’t decided? Will you hand this building over to us? Won’t you be able to buy alcohol every day until you die then?”</p><p>…What was it this time? I felt like I was caught up in another troublesome incident.  				</p>'),(282,12,'Chapter 23',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 23</p><p>“Hey, Old Man! You still haven’t decided? Will you hand this building over to us? Then won’t you be able to buy alcohol every day until you die?”</p><p>The men who entered the smithy were rough looking and their physique was good. They reminded me of the employees from Mother’s Heart is Happy. They took a heavy-handed attitude as they handed a sheet of paper to the elderly blacksmith.</p><p>‘What’s this?’</p><p>It was a contract to sell this building and the land to the Mero Company. I instinctively realized it.</p><p>‘If I analyze this based on my recent successes and troubles, it’s likely that I’ll get involved in a stupid quest as I stand here.’</p><p>That absolutely couldn’t be allowed to happen. The urgent thing right now was to earn money by making items.</p><p>‘There’s no time to waste on unwanted quests.’</p><p>I admired my brain’s quick thinking and moved to avoid this situation. But how many things ever went according to my will? I only managed to move a few steps before I was caught by the gangsters.</p><p>“Hey, where did this newbie come from? You trying to sneak into our business like a rat?”</p><p>They started to question me in an intimidating manner.</p><p>“Did you come to steal the contents of our contract? You, are you a spy? Did the Skaner Company send you?”</p><p>Why did I get caught up in the contents of that piece of paper? This was really some useless curiosity. </p><p>‘I should’ve just stayed in the rear and avoided looking at them.’</p><p>I shrugged as if to say ‘Spy, me? What are you talking about? It isn’t like that, so don’t worry about me. I just want to go my own way.’ </p><p>But they continued to act tough.</p><p>Gulp.</p><p>‘Damn.’</p><p>My saliva dried up and sweat beaded up on my forehead. I remembered my low-level days in Satisfy.</p><p>Was it due to the fearful memories of being a bread shuttle, or being threatened by teenage gangster NPCs in the back alleys? Or maybe it was because they resembled the employees from Mother’s Heart is Happy Financial Services.</p><p>I reflexively shrank back from the group; I couldn’t cope with this.</p><p>‘I should behave.’</p><p>Violent NPCs didn’t fear the law. It was entirely possible to be severely injured or killed if I even so much as touched these guys. Of course, I could report the NPCs to the guards, but their fists were closer than the law was.  It might be possible if I was stronger or quick enough to flee from this building. However, that wasn’t the case so it was better to avoid irritating them.</p><p>‘Judging by their appearance and atmosphere, they aren’t back alley bullies. They don’t just smoke cigarettes and use bread shuttles.’</p><p>The Mero Company was the second largest business company in the Eternal Kingdom. They wouldn’t give jobs to losers. These assholes were all gangsters.</p><p>‘Based on their equipment, they’re at least level 35.’</p><p>Gangsters over level 35! How many people have they hurt and frightened in order to level up? I couldn’t imagine all the sins that these people had committed. </p><p>‘There are five of them… In contrast, I am only level 3. While my stats are superior compared to those of my level, they’re all still around level 20. Not only that I am alone as well.’</p><p>To make matters worse, I was unarmed. I would only lose if I got into a fight with them. </p><p>‘Yes, let’s act prudently and discard my pride.’</p><p>As soon as I organized my thoughts, I smiled as brightly as possible and explained, “I’m not here to spy on you. I am just a customer passing by. So you don’t have to be so vigilant. Heheh.”</p><p>Acting subservient to NPCs! I felt no shame. The hand of the man holding my shoulder loosened slightly.</p><p>“Customer? At this smithy?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Hoh? A customer of this smithy…”</p><p>The grip of the man’s hand on my shoulder strengthened again.</p><p>‘Ouch, it hurts.’</p><p>I frowned due to the pain. Curse words almost popped out of my mouth, but I remained patient. Instead of scolding him, I tried my best to maintain my smile. Why? Otherwise, I might get hit! There was an old saying that you couldn’t spit when there was a smile on the other person’s face.</p><p>The gangsters eyed me with suspicion.</p><p>“The street operated by the Mero Company has a large number of weapons stores, so why would you come to a smithy like this? Isn’t this strange?”</p><p>“There might be many weapons stores, but this is the only smithy. I don’t want to buy a weapon, but instead find a blacksmith for production-related work. Therefore, it was inevitable that I came here. Hehe, I had no idea this smithy was troubled since I am new to Winston.”</p><p>I could debut as a lead actor right away and would be the perfect candidate for the New Actor Award at the end of year ceremonies. My appearance and tone were subservient. I continued to smile and the suspicious gangster released me.</p><p>“I somehow feel like hitting you, but you’re a blacksmith as well? Umm, indeed. You’re so weak that you can’t be a spy… Okay, get out of here. Don’t think about coming here again.”</p><p>Did he want to hit me? Did I look poor and weak? These scum thought they could make fun of me just because of how I looked? The fury in my heart boiled over. However, be patient.</p><p>“Hehe, thank you for believing in me. I’ll be going now.”</p><p>I was able to keep the smile until the last minute as I quickly headed out of the smithy. Then the old blacksmith’s angry voice was heard behind me, “Yes… there’s nothing to be gained from dragging this dirty work out too long. It is better to avoid such things. I’m too tired now.”</p><p>As I paused for a moment, the old man blinked his bloodshot eyes. It was to stop the tears from falling down.</p><p>“Give me that contract. I’ll sign it as you wish.”</p><p>“Eh? R-Really?”</p><p>“Ohh! Good thinking Old Man!”</p><p>“It took a long time, but you have finally made a wise decision.”</p><p>The gangsters cheered at the old man’s words. It was like a festival. The one who seemed to be the leader handed the contract to the old man.</p><p>“All you have to do is sign. Then you can take it easy.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>The old man gazed at the contract and hesitated for a moment before reaching towards the contract with trembling hands. At that moment, tears fell from the old man’s eyes. “Ahh! This is the end of my seven generation family business! I won’t be able to face my ancestors after death!” </p><p>The sight of the sad and depressed old man was unbearable. But the gangsters mocked him instead of comforting him,</p><p>“You abruptly stopped blacksmithing, so isn’t it natural for the customers to turn away? And Old Man, didn’t you have a child? Your only son died, so you turned to the bottles? You don’t have a successor, so once you die, your family line will naturally be cut off. You were defending something that had no value. Didn’t your debts just increase? Pathetic, truly pathetic.”</p><p>“You! Don’t mention my son with that vulgar mouth!”</p><p>“Why the hell are you so loud? Do you want to be scolded like last time?”</p><p>The gangster called ‘Johnson’ threatened to hit the old man. I was angry when I saw Johnson. </p><p>‘Isn’t that an old man? Not only did he speak rudely to the old man, but threatening to beat him up…’</p><p>At that moment, a gangster called ‘Um’ spoke, “Look, the contract should be completed today.”</p><p>Then the one called ‘Praga’ jumped in like an excited foal, “No, I’m mad. Didn’t we have to wait a few months for the old man to acceptwhile that old man refused? Think about how much we suffered because of him!”</p><p>The gangster called ‘Neil’ continued, “I agree… Fuck, we couldn’t even properly handle an old man. We received less pay on the scheduled date because of this.”</p><p>Then the silent leader, ‘Veil’ smiled coldly and said, “That’s right, you must compensate us for the damages we received.”</p><p>Veil slapped the old man’s cheek and said, “Hey Old Man, once you receive the money for selling this smithy, half of it will be used to pay off your debt, while the other half will be handed to us. Isn’t it obvious to compensate us for the damages you caused?”</p><p>“You dog bastards!” The old man, Khan, angrily replied to Veil.</p><p>“Hey, you don’t have a wife or son to feed, so why do you need a large amount of money? You should help the poor, young people like me.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>My insides were boiling with anger. </p><p>‘I don’t respect senior citizens much, but…’</p><p>When I used public transportation such as the bus or subway, I never yielded my seat to the elderly. I paid the same taxes, so I also had the right to enjoy the seat! No matter how burdensome their gazes were, I never gave way.</p><p>‘But…’</p><p>I didn’t insult or tease the elderly, unlike these gangsters. I was really angry.</p><p>‘Young pups treating grandmothers and grandfathers like this… it is terrible.’</p><p>So? Should I help the old man, despite my low level?</p><p>NO~ NO~ I don’t have a sense of justice. Why should I help others? I couldn’t think of any benefits. In my childhood, I was disgusted by superheroes instead of admiring them like everyone else.</p><p>‘Why are they getting hurt trying to save others? Are they crazy?’</p><p>I couldn’t understand the heroes who sacrificed themselves to defeat the villain. My young self cringed as I watched their unconditional sacrifice. So when the neighborhood kids played as heroes, I acted as the villain. Once I became the villain, I enjoyed the pleasure I got from harassing my friends who played the role of heroes. I showed sense by pretending to die at the end of the game, meaning the other children didn’t feel any resentment. </p><p>‘When I think about it, I have been like this since childhood. Yes, from the beginning, I closed my eyes whenever I saw injustice.’</p><p>So I turned away from the old man who was being humiliated and about to lose the business that had been in his family for seven generations. Sure, some regrets remained.</p><p>‘The situation has become like this, so it is impossible to make items in this smithy. If I want to move villages, I have to pay for that scamming expensive carriage again? Do I really have to move villages once more? No, there is no need to. I will just hunt and raise my level until the new owner of this smithy starts work.’</p><p>Wait?</p><p>‘Don’t I need equipment to hunt? This damn thing! I stored my sword and armor in the warehouse. My 50 silver!’ </p><p>My stress levels weren’t a joke. My stomach hurt when I thought about all the money that was flying away. Why was my life so twisted? Uhh… I’m getting a stomach ache. I should leave here as soon as possible.’</p><p>But strangely, my feet didn’t move.</p><p>‘That old man… is this okay?’</p><p>Ah! Really! Fuck!</p><p>Maybe it was because I witnessed the dirty work. No matter how much I dreamed about a life that was far from good, I still had the basic fundamentals of a human. It was too much for my conscience to ignore the old man surrounded by gangsters.</p><p>‘No, why risk myself for someone else? Am I stupid?’</p><p>I was fully aware that I should turn a blind eye to this. So why was I hesitating?</p><p>‘When did I become nosy? This behavior isn’t like me. I’ve always closed my eyes to injustice.’</p><p>The moment I braced myself to leave the smithy.</p><p></p><p>[Your anger levels are at their peak after witnessing gangsters commit wrongdoings towards a blacksmith.]</p><p>[The quest ‘Blacksmith’s Rage’ has been created.]  				</p>'),(283,12,'Chapter 24',_binary '<p></p><p>  				Chapter 24</p><p>[Blacksmith’s Rage]</p><p>Difficulty: B</p><p>As Pagma’s descendant, you have inherited Pagma’s will as well as his techniques.

A ruined smithy and blacksmith. The sudden appearance of gangsters was the precursor to the beginning of a new quest.</p><p></p><p>[Would you like to accept the quest?)</p><p></p><p>There were five enemies. Their level was estimated to be 35 or higher. On the other hand, I was alone and only level 3. I was also unharmed because I left my sword and armor in the warehouse.</p><p>Should I refuse the quest? No.</p><p>“I accept.”</p><p>There was no reason for me to refuse this quest.</p><p>Even though I was level 3, my stats made me equivalent to a level 20. I also had the skill ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience.’ It was a tremendous skill that increased my concentration, stamina, and defense to the peak for an hour. But was that all? I had the passive skill that allowed me to become invincible for five seconds if my health was at the minimum.</p><p>“In fact, I’m not without a weapon.”</p><p>I opened my inventory. I took out one arrow that I had left behind as a souvenir.</p><p></p><p>[Special Jaffa Arrow] </p><p>Rating: Epic</p><p>Attack Power: 35~42</p><p>An arrow made by a craftsman with great skill and potential but lacking in experience and reputation. </p><p>Due to the effect of combining jaffa with steel, it has extremely high penetration and ignores some of the enemy’s defense.</p><p>* Has a certain chance of ignoring the enemy’s defense.</p><p>Weight: 0.1 </p><p></p><p>Arrows were consumables. But that was only when fired by a bow.</p><p>“If I hold it and use it as a dagger, it won’t be a consumable.”</p><p>In fact, there were many cases when arrows were retrieved and reused. It was said that most arrows could be reused except when it was too damaged by the target, but I didn’t know because I had no experience shooting the bow.</p><p>‘I thought it was strange that arrows were so expensive so I grabbed a passerby. Thanks to that, I realized that arrows weren’t always consumables. Huhut, information was power! I shouldn’t neglect the impact of  gathering information in the future.’</p><p>I smiled with satisfaction and examined the gangsters closely. They were holding threatening weapons like axes, swords, and maces while wearing leather armor.</p><p>‘The heavens are helping me.’</p><p>It might be different if they were wearing iron armor. However, I could cause serious damage if I stabbed the leather armor several times with the Jaffa Arrow.</p><p>‘This arrow is something I made with my heart. Its value couldn’t be compared with normal arrows. I might have the attack power of a level 20 but I trust this arrow. Due to the option to ignore defense, I will be able to fill up the offensive gap. There is also the countless combat experiences I have accumulated in my days as a warrior.’</p><p>My stats that were higher than my level, a suitable weapon, a fraudulent skill and combat senses acquired from past experience. I believed that these four elements were enough to clear the quest.</p><p>‘It is a very low possibility.’</p><p>Would I willingly accept a quest that was more likely to fail than succeed? It was obvious. </p><p>First, there was no penalty if the quest failed. The NPC Khan would die and all quests associated with him permanently destroyed, but it wasn’t something I should be afraid of since I didn’t know what the quests were.</p><p>Secondly, I was rewarded just by accepting the quest.</p><p></p><p>[The quest has been accepted.]</p><p>[Due to the quest acceptance, the skill ‘Blacksmith’s Rage’ has been acquired.]</p><p></p><p>The quest acceptance reward was different from the quest clear reward.

But the buff I just learn increased by attack power and attack speed, and the cooldown time was one minute.</p><p>‘Isn’t this a windfall? Kukuk… Oh, is this the hidden quest that I’ve heard about? However, isn’t the quest difficulty too low for a hidden quest? Maybe this… it is likely to be a linked quest. The quests owned by Blacksmith Khan are probably linked quests. This is a real hit.’</p><p>As soon as I realized the importance of Blacksmith Khan, I had an obligation to do my best to clear the quest.</p><p>‘Thanks to the new skill, the possibility of clearing the quest is even higher… Good.’</p><p>I decided to approach the gangsters.</p><p>“What the, this guy?” The gangsters tilted their heads as I came back instead of leaving.</p><p>I pointed the arrow towards them. Then I explained to them the biggest reason why I accepted this quest.</p><p>“You crossed the line. I am also indifferent to elderly people, but not as much as you. You don’t have to feel respect towards elderly people, but shouldn’t you maintain the minimum of courtesies? You should take care of your education, you bastards. I can’t forgive you.”</p><p>I wasn’t trying to imitate the apostle of justice. I just didn’t like people like these!</p><p>“Blame the fact that you look like Mother’s Heart is Happy employees.”</p><p>As I stepped closer, the gangsters started to grab their weapons.</p><p>“You bastard! This brat dares say such things to us? Eh? No, did something suddenly happen to this brat? Hey you! Do you want to go to hell? Huh?”</p><p>“This bastard didn’t appreciate the fact that we let you go…”</p><p>Indeed, lawless NPCs were fearsome. They instantly showed an intention to kill me. They were truly people who had committed numerous evils.</p><p>‘They are too formidable.’</p><p>But there was no reason to avoid them due to fear. Right now, these people weren’t the objects of fear. They are targets that must be defeated to clear the quest. The ambition of a warrior was boiling inside of me.</p><p>I snorted with derision towards the gangsters and raised my hand. “Stop your useless talking and come on.”</p><p>The gangsters reacted immediately.</p><p>“This crazy bastard!”</p><p>“Get him! Hold on to him for me! No, kill him! Just kill him.”</p><p>The red-faced gangsters rushed towards me. There were a total of five opponents. In a wide open space, I would be surrounded and die instantly. I had identified the terrain of the smithy ahead of time and headed for the stairs leading towards the second floor. The staircase was wide enough for two adult men to stand side by side.</p><p>I stood in the middle of it with the arrow.</p><p>“Anyone who wants to be stung should come up here.”</p><p>The gangsters flinched when I took the geographical advantage, then belatedly confirmed the identity of the weapon in my hand.</p><p>“What is that? An arrow?”</p><p>“Puhahaha. Do you want to deal with us with that arrow? Where is your bow? Eh? Did you drop it on your mother’s skirt, Newbie?”</p><p>“Anyway, a blacksmith can’t use a bow. They don’t handle weapons very well. So it is no wonder he needs to swing an arrow. He is seriously young.”</p><p>These guys were belittling me! Among them, Johnson had the most vicious nature so he rushed forward first. “I will cut this blacksmith up like a bear.”</p><p>I faced Johnson, who had charged forward ignorantly like a wild boar, and used the skill I had just learned.</p><p>“Blacksmith’s Rage.”</p><p></p><p>[Blacksmith’s Rage has been activated.

It was a notification window that showed the duration of the skill. I confirmed that the skill was successfully cast and quickly thrust out my arm.</p><p>Papat!</p><p>It was quicker than Johnson could swing his axe. My arrow pierced his chest twice. Large weapons had the advantage of high damage and durability, but they had a fatal disadvantage of slow attack speed. On the other hand, my attack was quick due to the weightless arrow. In addition, I used Blacksmith’s Rage and was able to overwhelm Johnson with speed.</p><p></p><p>[Critical!]</p><p>[The effect of the Special Jaffa arrow is activated, meaning the enemy’s defense is completely ignored.]</p><p></p><p>“Ke…heok!”</p><p>It was only two attacks, but the full power was unleashed.

I never imagined that an arrow could deal damage like this.</p><p>“H-how…?”</p><p>Johnson had a disbelieving expression on his face as the arrow pierced the leather armor. Then he coughed up blood and rolled down the stairs. He turned into a grey light and several messages popped up before my eyes.</p><p></p><p>[You have defeated Winston’s outlaw, Johnson.]</p><p>[Reputation in Winston Village has increased by 60.]</p><p>[Your relationship with the Winston outlaws has become hostile.]</p><p>[The Winston outlaws will try to kill you when they find you.]</p><p>[4,300 experience has been acquired.]</p><p>[Your level has risen.]</p><p>[Your level has risen.]</p><p>[Your level has risen.]</p><p>[Your level has risen.]</p><p>[Your level has risen.]</p><p></p><p>“Wow.”</p><p>I expected the gangster to be at least level 35.

Even if it was a critical hit and the enemy’s defense was ignored, I never expected to do it in only two hits.</p><p>‘These guys, do they have less health compared to their appearance?’</p><p>It was a good explanation.

Is this correct?]</p><p></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The warning statements popped up and my strength and agility greatly increased. The other gangsters were surprised to see their companion suddenly die and couldn’t climb the stairs.</p><p>“W-W-What is that guy? How did he handle Johnson so easily?”</p><p>“Johnson wasn’t vigilant and allowed himself to be stabbed in the heart twice.”</p><p>“Still, isn’t that bastard’s weapon just an arrow? It wasn’t shot from a bow, but a hand wielded arrow broke through leather armor and did such damage? Nonsense. It is impossible.”</p><p>“…This blacksmith must be so strong that he doesn’t depend on weapons. Maybe he isn’t a blacksmith in the first place. He is a warrior. I’m sure of this.”</p><p>“What does that… Maybe he just looks weak.”</p><p>“Don’t just pay attention to the outward appearance.”</p><p>The gangsters watched me carefully. Blacksmith’s Rage only lasted 10 more seconds so I provoked them.</p><p>“What are you doing? Aren’t you attacking? Isn’t it four of you against one of me? You third-rate, hulking gangster scum.”</p><p>“Third-rate? What is this jerk seeing?”</p><p>“Praga, wait!”</p><p>Despite the calls from his companions, the gangster called Praga fell for the taunt and rushed. This time, the weapon was a huge mace. The attack speed was very slow, just like Johnson who used the axe.</p><p>Kwajajak!</p><p>He ran up the staircase and the mace aimed for my face. I avoided it as much as possible and pushed the arrow forward.</p><p>Papapat!</p><p>My increased agility was immediately effective. This time, I was able to strike the arrow three times before the enemy could attack once.</p><p>“Ahhhhhh!”</p><p>Praga was stabbed three times in the chest and retreated.</p><p>‘Dammit.’</p><p>This time, there wasn’t a critical hit. In addition, the optional effect of the Special Jaffa Arrow wasn’t activated. Was that why? My attack power had increased thanks to the 50 points invested in strength, but Praga didn’t die.</p><p>“Hey, are you okay?”</p><p>“Kuoock… it isn’t enough to kill me.” </p><p>“Hmm… I guess it was just a coincidence that he took care of Johnson in two hits. The attack power seems weaker than I expected.”</p><p>Little by little, the gangsters started to identify my strength. Then Veil explained to his men, “The thing we need to watch out for now is his attack speed. He is overwhelmingly faster than us because we use large weapons, so fighting one-on-one is definitely a disadvantage.”</p><p>“Then what?”</p><p>“What should we do? It is simple.”</p><p>Veil winked and they stood as a group in front of the staircase. Then he spoke to me, who was standing alone on the staircase. “I won’t go up to grab you. You can’t stay up there forever. Won’t you eventually have to come down? Then I will kill you.”</p><p>Heok… they were quite smart.</p><p>‘If they were monsters, they would move without thinking.’</p><p>My plan to take advantage of the terrain was all in vain.</p><p>‘There are four people remaining. One of them is seriously injured, but he can still fight. Damn… no matter what method I think of, it is too dangerous to deal with them all at once. How can I clear this quest?’</p><p>I could be satisfied with the fact that I acquired a new skill through this quest. I was curious about the linked quests and rewards that would be received from Blacksmith Khan, but should I take the risk?</p><p>‘It is wiser to forcibly quit the quest by running away, instead of dying. But…’</p><p>My eyes looked somewhere else. I flinched the moment I met the eyes of the old man standing in the corner, Khan. Was it due to the expectations, hope, and gratitude in the eyes of the old man looking at me?</p><p>It was like he was looking at a hero.</p><p>‘Don’t gaze at me with such eyes. I’m not a hero.’</p><p>I tried to ignore the old man’s gaze. Then I stopped just before logging out.</p><p>‘Just accepting the quest gave me a new skill. I am 100% certain that this is a hidden quest. The rewards of the linked quests received from that old man must be beyond imagination. Isn’t it stupid to give up on a rare quest that I might not encounter again?’</p><p>Yes, I should try it. I headed down the stairs. I was immediately besieged by the gangsters waiting for me.</p><p>‘My defense is close to zero. My health is also small. If I allow these guys to attack, I will be killed in two or three hits, even if they aren’t fatal wounds. The important thing isn’t to fight as quickly as possible. Carefully, carefully.’</p><p>I concentrated as much as possible, confirmed the cooldown time of Blacksmith’s Rage was over and used the skill again.</p><p>“Blacksmith’s Rage.”</p><p></p><p>[Blacksmith’s Rage has been activated.

Next.</p><p>“Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience.”</p><p></p><p>[Nothing happens.]</p><p></p><p>“Eh…?”</p><p>The skill didn’t activate? I was confused and hurriedly opened the skill window.

The price for one was 10 gold. 10 gold was 12,000 won!</p><p>\'I’m sorry but it can’t be helped.’</p><p>I closed my eyes and poured 20 gold, in other words, 24,000 won, down my throat.</p><p><em>Gulp gulp.</em></p><p>I shed tears as the buff potion was swallowed.</p><p>‘Ahh! This potion is more expensive than the sweet and sour pork set!’</p><p>I prepared the buff potions for moments of crisis during Earl Ashur’s quest, but I felt such regret that I never used them.

I turned away from the gangsters and sneakily drank the potion. At the same time, my health and the wound on my leg recovered. </p><p>‘Now.’</p><p>The gangsters thought I was still seriously injured. I used that to sneak attack one of them.</p><p>“N-No?”</p><p>They couldn’t respond properly because they thought my leg was still injured.

However, the other two gangsters  didn’t care and struck. I turned around and ran away from them.</p><p>\"Kuhahahaha! Stupid person! You threw away your weapon.”</p><p>The gangsters saw me running away unarmed and chased after me. Praga overcame the crisis of the flying arrow and sighed with relief. I never looked back at them.

Cold sweat dripped on her back as she shot a nervous look at her mother who had just arrived to check in on her. </p><p> \"Mother, I…\" Evie subconsciously grabbed her mother\'s skirt. She couldn\'t help it. She thought she had prepared herself enough in the last few days but it seemed the fear and uncertainty still threatened to crash her resolve now that the moment had arrived. </p><p> \"Hush, dear,\" her mother said as she gave her daughter a reassuring hug, but the concern in her eyes gave her away. \"Don\'t worry, you can do this my dear,\" she whispered as she gently rubbed Evie\'s back. \"Don\'t forget the reason you have to do this, Evie…\" </p><p> Her mother kissed her head and though she didn\'t look shaken, Evie could sense the anxiousness and distress within her mother. </p><p> Evie took a deep breath. \"Yes, mother,\" she replied, as she flashed a forced smile toward her mother. \"I can do this.\" </p><p> \"Good girl...\" Her mother\'s arms wrapped around her again for one last hug and after a second, her mother nodded at her maid. </p><p> \"I am going to meet the guests now while you get ready,\" she told Evie and after giving her daughter one last encouraging smile, Evie\'s mother finally left the room. </p><p> Evie closed her eyes and her maid immediately hovered around her. She tried her best to calm her pounding heart, talking to herself inwardly and telling herself it would be alright, that everything would be alright. She was so focused in hardening her resolve that she was a little startled when the maid finally spoke. </p><p> \"You look stunning, milady.\" Evie\'s eyes flew towards the mirror and she studied her reflection. Her hair was so beautifully arranged; her face painted just enough to emphasize her natural, innocent, maiden features. </p><p> Evie stared at herself quietly. It had finally arrived, the day of her wedding. She used to fantasize about this day when she was younger, daydreaming about how magical and wonderful it would be to marry the man of her dreams. She had seen herself smiling with so much happiness and excitement and delight as she marched down the aisle towards her dream groom. </p><p> But none of these fantasies of hers were going to happen. Instead of excitement and delight, her heart was filled with dread and unease. Well, nobody could blame her because like most of the ladies in the highest echelon of power, Evie couldn\'t choose whom to marry. She had mistakenly, stupidly thought she was safe from all these things because she wasn\'t a princess. However, she was the daughter of the most powerful noble family in the entire Empire. In the end, she couldn\'t escape this fate. In fact, she couldn\'t believe she actually had it worse than anyone else she knew, probably even more than the princesses of any Empire in existence. At least those princesses were married off to emperors and high ranking military generals from their neighboring human empires. </p><p> Yes, she too, was about to marry a prince but… unlike those princesses, her husband-to-be wasn\'t human… he was a vampire. And vampires were their enemy, the human\'s mortal enemies. </p><p> \"It\'s time, milady.\" The handmaid\'s voice almost made her jump from her seat again. She let out another long and deep sigh - noble ladies like her did not express their dissatisfaction audibly - before she stood up with her head held high, and walked towards the door. </p><p> The door at the entrance was opened for her and she stepped gracefully over the sill before proceeding calmly along the corridor. She couldn\'t count how many times she had taken a deep breath as she walked towards those doors, doors which looked more daunting with each step she took. With one last step, she finally stood just before the large double doors leading towards the wedding hall. </p><p> \'Be strong, Evie. For the sake of your family and the entire empire,\' she whispered to herself again and again. She squared her shoulders and looked up once again as she waited for the doors to open. The moon and the stars were brightly shining down on her. </p><p> In her daydreams, her wedding day always took place on a fine sunny day where she would be surrounded by falling petals dancing in the wind. Who would\'ve thought she was going to get married in the middle of the night and to a creature of the night? </p><p> The sky was clear and calm and peaceful. The stars blinked at her but even the calmness of the sky couldn\'t ease the turmoil that was bubbling inside her. Her pulse was racing and all she could do was take deep breaths, again and again. Her hands were shaking and it took all her strength to keep them still again. </p><p> Her presence was then announced and at long last, the procession began. </p><p> The hall she walked into screamed of luxury and was a feast to the eyes, but contrary to all the beautiful grandeur that filled the room, the atmosphere was, as expected, tense and heavy. It was extremely rare for vampires and humans to be present under one roof. There were occasions, of course, where the two races stood under the same roof but the difference this time was that they weren\'t intent on killing each other. Because of this wedding, the vampires and humans agreed to a ceasefire, the first one in history. </p><p> As she walked closer to the altar, her long, tapered fingers clutched her dress hard - an action that went unnoticed by the guests because her hands were swallowed by the voluminous folds of her gown - but Evie\'s eyes remained fixated on the floor. Her face was still facing forward but her eyes were trained on that single spot, always 5 feet away in front of her on the floor. She couldn\'t relax. She felt like she was walking on a small, thin stretch of road between vampire and human armies on the battlefield right before they collided and killed each other. Above all, she felt like a small, innocent little lamb voluntarily walking to the butcher\'s house to be sacrificed, despite being promised that her soon-to-be husband and the vampires would never hurt her. </p><p> The tension was so thick in the air that all she wanted to do was turn around and run away, but she didn\'t. She couldn\'t. </p><p> Evie couldn\'t hear anything but the loud pounding of her own heartbeat. She couldn\'t even raise her eyes to take a peek at her husband-to-be because she was terrified! All her encounters with vampires terrified her to the core. Granted, she hadn\'t seen that many of them, but five years ago, she had come across a captured vampire. The vampire had had his sharp teeth bared, snarling with disgust and rage at his captors, and his eyes had glowed blood red which was a stark contrast to his overly pale skin. This vampire\'s appearance had horrified Evie. The same was true of the vampires who attacked her carriage a year ago. </p><p> She was scared of all vampires. All humans feared vampires. Vampires were the villainous monsters that mothers always used to scare their children. And yet, here she was, about to marry one of them. </p><p> Lost in her own fears, Evie didn\'t realize that she had reached the altar and she was instantly pulled back to the present when a hand appeared in her view. She almost stumbled in shock. Staring at the hand, Evie swallowed. She just knew this was the hand of the vampire prince she was going to marry. </p><p> Slowly, she lifted her eyes, her gaze moving from his hand, up to his elbow, across to his abdomen before stopping on his chest. She breathed in silently before she continued upwards, finally stopping on his face. </p><p> And the moment their eyes met… Evie\'s heart momentarily stopped. </p>'),(286,13,'Chapter 2 - The Vampire Prince',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> The man before her looked nothing like she had been expecting. His eyes weren\'t red like blood. His fangs weren\'t showing. In fact, he seemed to have no fangs at all. And… he wasn\'t as pale as the vampires she had encountered before. He was pale compared to humans, but he wasn\'t that sickly shade of white like all the other vampires she had previously seen. And the most striking thing of all was that… he was just… breathtaking. </p><p> Evie was lost in a trance but was immediately jolted back to the present when she heard someone clear their throat. </p><p> She couldn\'t tear her eyes off his as she slowly lifted her hand to place it in his outstretched one. His eyes were silvery gray, akin to the bright moon, and they were full of life, as if there were many stars swirling within them. Then there were his lashes… they were so indecently long and thick for a man. His lips, his jaw, his nose… every single part of him rendered her speechless. She had never seen another human who had been fashioned with such beauty and perfection. But then again, she remembered that he wasn\'t human to begin with. </p><p> She told herself to look away but for some reason, she couldn\'t. She felt like he somehow did something to her as soon as their eyes met. </p><p> When her hand touched his, she almost flinched as her heartbeat thudded even louder. He led her to stand right next to him before he let go of her hand. When he released her hand, she felt the cool air replace where his hand had been and it was then that she realized his skin wasn\'t cold. She had heard from human soldiers that vampires were cold blooded creatures and that they were as cold as corpses to the touch. </p><p> But his hands weren\'t cold at all. Why was that? How come his hand was warm? It couldn\'t just be her imagination! </p><p> Evie didn\'t have the chance to even begin to ponder this puzzle any further because the ceremony started without delay. Anyone from the outside looking in would easily be able to tell that everyone couldn\'t wait for this wedding to end. The humans present were eager for the vampires to finally leave this place and their empire while the visiting vampires were certainly also looking forward to granting the humans\' wishes to leave this place and go back to their own empire. For once, humans and vampires agreed on the same thing. </p><p> And thus, just as everyone hoped, the wedding hastily ended. </p><p> Evie had attended other princesses\' and nobles\' weddings before and she almost wanted to smirk at the speed at which they carried out and ended what was meant to be a most special occasion; her wedding. But then again, she couldn\'t blame anyone. No one wanted this wedding in the first place. Every one of them, even the bride and the groom, was forced into this union. </p><p> A deep, quiet sigh escaped Evie\'s lips when everyone started to quickly move and disperse. She couldn\'t believe how quickly the hall became empty. </p><p> Her husband offered his hand to her again. Of course, Evie already prepared herself for this. She was going to the Northern Empire, the vampire\'s land, right after the wedding so she already said her goodbyes to her family before the vampires even arrived. </p><p> A little shaky, Evie placed her hand in his. Her eyes were hot but she swore not to tear up. She looked at her mother as the vampire prince led her towards the door. </p><p> Her mother was crying, sobbing quietly where she stood, and it took all of Evie to stop herself from following her lead. Evie looked away, focusing on the path before her instead. As the newlyweds reached the door, Evie halted and looked back one last time. She subconsciously gripped her husband\'s hand before she turned to him and finally stepped forward. This was all she could do from here on out; to bravely walk into her future, one step at a time, to find out what destiny had in store for her. </p>'),(287,13,'Chapter 3 - Truce',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> \"Scared?\" His deep and masculine voice echoed inside the carriage causing the already tensed Evie to flinch. She realized that she was clutching her dress so hard that her knuckles had turned white. She kept her face looking outside the window, blankly staring at the palace that they were just married in, as it slowly disappeared from her view. </p><p> With a deliberate slowness, Evie turned to face him. When she lifted her face, his perfect face graced her eyes. Only one thought ran through her mind as she looked at him. If only… If only, he was human. </p><p> She answered him with a shake of her head. Of course, that was a lie. She was scared to death. It didn\'t help that her husband… yes, her husband was such a gorgeous creature, because she knew what was really hidden behind all that beauty and perfection. </p><p> \"I… I thought v-vampires didn\'t ride in carriages,\" she stammered, saying the first thing her mind could think of that had nothing to do with how perfect he looked, in her desperation to break the awkward and deafening silence. And perhaps, also to try and subdue her rising fear. She needed to relax. There was nothing else she could do anymore. There was no turning back so it was no use being scared now. If she wanted to survive this, she needed to conquer her fear and face her new life head on. That was the only choice left to her, to willingly lay in the bed that others made for her or suffer the consequences. </p><p> When she saw a small smile curve on her husband\'s face, Evie almost forgot to breathe. \"That\'s right. We usually don\'t need to,\" he replied. </p><p> \"T-then why…\" she trailed off realizing that it was definitely because of her. Her fear somewhat lessened, knowing that this vampire prince, her husband, was at least being considerate. But then she remembered this was part of the deal. The vampires, especially her husband, were now responsible for her. They were to watch over her and keep her safe whether they liked it or not. Still, Evie was glad that at least her husband, the prince, decided to be the one to accompany her on this journey. \"T-thank you, y-your highness.\" </p><p> His immediate response was a soft sigh. </p><p> \"Evielyn,\" he called out and Evie didn\'t know why but she caught her breath. The sound of her name spoken by him suddenly sent a strange and weird feeling through her. \"Do you know my name?\" he asked. </p><p> \"O-of course I do.\" </p><p> \"Then use it when we\'re alone.\" </p><p> \"Yes, your…uh, I mean, Prince Gavriel.\" </p><p> His brows creased, causing Evie to subconsciously flinch. \"Remove the title, Evielyn.\" </p><p> \"G-gavriel,\" she uttered obediently as her eyes wandered around. Surprisingly, this somehow wasn\'t as hard as she imagined. Evie never once thought she would one day find herself married to a vampire, a creature she, and every human, grew up believing to be a savage monster. She had expected she might not be able to speak at all to her husband without trembling but somehow, conversing with him wasn\'t as dreadful as she thought. She was tense and stammering but she was glad, she wasn\'t muted because of fear and she wasn\'t trembling before him as she had thought she would be. </p><p> Gavriel leaned his head back against the wall and closed his eyes. \"The vampires promised that no one, I, your husband, included, could lay a finger on you without your consent. Your father and those human emperors made us take that vow. I\'m certain you know that vows are sacred to us. We rarely make vows because we don\'t break vows. We can\'t,\" he said suddenly without looking at her. His eyes remained closed. \"That should be enough to ease your fears.\" </p><p> Evie bit her lip but before she could say anything, he continued. </p><p> \"I\'m your husband now, Evielyn.\" His voice became a little firm. But then, he opened his eyes and leaned closer to her. He stared so deeply into her eyes that Evie couldn\'t turn her gaze away even if she wanted to. Why? Why did he have to look this gorgeous? </p><p> \"Let me remind you again that as your husband, I personally vowed to protect you. So stop flinching every time I speak to you…\" he trailed off and he lifted his hand as if to pinch her chin but stopped midway. \"I don\'t like it when my wife keeps flinching as if I\'m going to attack her every time I speak.\" </p><p> Since Evie was a young girl, she was taught that vampires were monsters who viewed humans as nothing but food or slaves. She grew up believing they were humanity\'s notorious enemy. </p><p> Vampires and humans had been mortal enemies since Evie could remember. She heard that Vampires saw themselves as the superior creature and wanted to rule over the humans, treating them like they were their slaves and food. </p><p> The world they lived in was divided. The northern part of the Land of Lirea was occupied by vampires while the south, east, and western parts were occupied by humans. </p><p> There were endless wars between vampires and humans and despite the fact that humans dominated most of the Land, they couldn\'t defeat the vampires solely because vampires were powerful creatures. For countless years, the battle never ceased to end and vampires never once lost a war. But even so, these vampires never tried to annihilate any of the human empires because to them, humans were livestock that should exist forever for their enjoyment. Evie even heard a story from one soldier that the vampires never took the wars seriously, treating them like mere child\'s play. </p><p> Evie heard that humans have been under the vampires\' mercy for countless years until one day, humans learned to use the dragons to fight for them. </p><p> Since then, humans were no longer inferior and vampires began to lose some battles. The tides were slowly turning and even to the present day, the wars continued. Humans wanted to eradicate the vampires with the help of the dragons but the vampires were still powerful enough to withstand a fight even against the dragons. They were powerful, tricky monsters as the humans called them. </p><p> So when Evie first heard about her being married off to a vampire, she broke down. She was so angry and terrified that she had planned to run away. But on the night that she planned to escape, her father foiled her plans and stopped her before she could even leave her room. Evie adored her father and looked up to him not only because he was the current Guardian of the dragons and humanity\'s hero, but because he was her beloved father. Lord Lucius Ylvia, Evie\'s father was also the head of the house of Ylvia, the most powerful human noble family in the entire Land of Lirea. </p><p> The so-called guardians were the only ones who could tame and control the dragons and all of the guardians came from the house of Ylvia. Once the former guardian died, the guardian\'s son stepped up to take his place. It had been like that since the beginning of the house of Ylvia and this was why Evie\'s family was considered humanity\'s most protected treasure - for without the guardians, the humans\' only hope to stand against the vampires would crumble to ashes. </p><p> That night, Lucius spoke to Evie and told her everything. He told Evie that he and the three human emperors had proposed a truce with the vampires. They made it appear that Lucius refused to fight for the humans because he didn\'t want to die young like all the other guardians before him, saying that it was finally time for both vampires and humans to cease fire. But of course, that was a lie to cover the real problem. Lucius explained to Evie that humans were on the brink of doom because Lucius still couldn\'t produce a son, an heir, the next guardian. If Lucius died in battle, there wouldn\'t be anyone to succeed his power - since it was only the direct male son of the current guardian who could inherit the power to tame and control the dragons. </p><p> Evie had asked her father why the vampires would agree with the truce and her father also explained to her that the vampires will definitely take the bait because the vampires were also in a dire situation. Unlike humans, vampires\' birth rates were incredibly low. The vampires had been losing the more recent wars so they badly wanted years of ceasefire because if the war continued with the dragons helping the humans, the vampires would eventually go extinct because they had more deaths than births. </p><p> And then, Lucius hesitantly revealed to Evie that the vampires asked for something to solidify the truce between the two races and the human emperors suggested a marriage between human and vampire. The emperors suggested the most beautiful princess in all the three human empires but the vampires wanted her, the sole and beloved daughter of the current guardian, to marry their prince and then be taken to the North. Of course, even if her father didn\'t elaborate this, Evie knew why the vampires wanted her. She\'d be a more powerful hostage compared to any other princess. As long as she was in the hands of the vampires, the humans would not attack the Northern empire, especially because everyone knew how Lucius adored his daughter. </p><p> Evie refused to accept it but eventually, the emperors soon convinced her that she had no choice. They told her that if she didn\'t agree and the vampires attacked them, her father might die and she and her family and all the other empires would be destroyed. She would end up as food or a sex slave for the vampires, too. And thus, Evie was forced to accept her fate and become the sacrificial lamb to save everyone. </p><p> That night, her father had hugged her, apologized to her, and promised her that once an heir was born, he would definitely come to rescue her. This was why Evie made herself believe that she was just a hostage under the guise of the prince\'s wife. She never even thought about anything else but to survive in the vampire\'s land until her father came to rescue her. </p>'),(288,13,'Chapter 4 - Come Here',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> The inside of the carriage was enveloped with silence. The prince simply remained still, closing his eyes as if he had shut himself down. </p><p> The night was getting deeper and Evie could now feel the fatigue and dizziness from the rollercoaster of emotions from the day that even though she wanted to ponder her situation more, her mind began to float like clouds drifting aimlessly. She had been unable to sleep the few days before her wedding because of thoughts about her wedding and the vampire she was going to marry so she felt a little like a zombie. She felt lightheaded and dizzy and she tried to find the right position for her to sleep, but to her dismay, whenever she did manage to nod off, the carriage bounced on the rough patches on the road and she was awakened again. At times, it was so bad that she nearly bumped her head against the wall. </p><p> This was the first time she had travelled by night, but Evie knew she had to endure this. Her wedding was a secret and only the royals and her family knew about it. Common people didn\'t even know that vampires silently set foot in their midst. That was why their wedding happened at midnight. Now they needed to cross the border before daylight to avoid alarming the citizens who might spot the vampires who were with her. </p><p> So, she couldn\'t complain. This, too, was part of her duty, a duty she needed to endure. </p><p> The carriage rolled on and on, until suddenly, the carriage bounced and Evie nearly fell on the floor. She was instantly startled and she lifted her face, just to find out that strong large hands held her shoulders, steadying her. Gavriel had kept her from tumbling to the floor. </p><p> Still, she flinched and stiffened the moment their eyes met. His face darkened and he immediately let go of her. \"You\'re not going to tell me I broke the deal because I touched you without permission, are you?\" he asked in a cold but deep and mesmerizing voice. She couldn\'t believe that even his voice was too perfect. Why did nature bestow all these perfections to a creature like him? It wasn\'t fair! </p><p> Evie shook her head like a rattle. \"No, of course not. You saved me. T-there\'s no need to ask for permission in such circumstances.\" </p><p> His expression somewhat mellowed as he surveyed her. </p><p> \"I think we should look for an inn –\" </p><p> \"No!\" Evie cut him off and when she realized how she answered him, she lowered her gaze. \"I-t\'s okay. I… I\'m fine. I am used to this. Besides, we need to cross the border before daylight.\" </p><p> The man fell silent but Evie felt he was staring hard at her. </p><p> \"Are you sure?\" </p><p> \"Yes. I would prefer a sleepless night rather than be the cause of a fight breaking out.\" </p><p> She heard his quiet sigh. They again both sat in silence. Evie couldn\'t help but peek at him and she noticed the deep lines on his forehead getting deeper the more the carriage bounced. It occurred to her that he must hate riding a carriage. Vampires, she heard, were faster than any creatures, even faster than birds. They were able to reach their destination many times quicker than humans. She hadn\'t witnessed any vampires in action so curiosity suddenly hit her. </p><p> \"Is… is this your first time? Riding a carriage?\" she asked. </p><p> His gaze fell on her and stared at her. \"No, but this is the longest I have stayed inside one.\" </p><p> \"Oh.\" She noticed that there seemed to be no one left of the numbers of vampires who were with them in the palace. They must have left them long ago. \"How many hours would it take you to reach the imperial palace if I wasn\'t with you?\" </p><p> \"Just a couple of hours.\" </p><p> Evie\'s eyes widened. She heard that it would take two days to reach the vampire empire. For a moment, her eyes flickered with amazement. She thought that to be able to travel like that would be amazing! She would not need to endure the uncomfortable and tedious carriage rides. Looking at him, she wondered if he was dying with impatience because he was forced to endure travelling at such a slow pace because of her. He would have been in the imperial palace right now, resting. </p><p> \"You really don\'t need to accompany me –\" </p><p> \"Do I disgust you so much that you don\'t even want me inside the same carriage as you?\" His eyes narrowed. Though his expression remained calm, Evie felt chills as soon as she looked into his eyes. </p><p> Shaking her head, Evie spoke. \"No. That\'s not what I meant. I just thought it must be very uncomfortable for you to… stay in a carriage because you\'re not used to it.\" </p><p> The displeasure in his eyes was quick to disappear causing Evie to sigh in relief. Gavriel looked so calm and still, literally like a harmless, perfect statue. His appearance, Evie thought, must be the sole reason why she can speak to him like this without trembling in fear. </p><p> But she had also heard that vampires could become savage when angered so she was being very careful not to anger him. She didn\'t want to see this man with his eyes red and his fangs bared. Evie didn\'t know if she would still be able to speak calmly to him like this once she saw him in that state. </p><p> \"Are you saying you\'re used to this?\" he asked. \"You don\'t look any less comfortable, Evielyn. I would rather carry you and get this trip over and done with, but I doubt you could withstand the cold outside this vehicle.\" </p><p> \"C-carry me?\" </p><p> \"Yes. The others must have reached the capital by now if they travelled at full speed. I\'d have to go slower if I was carrying you but even so, we would probably get there before daylight, but…\" he surveyed her. \"It\'s way too risky for you,\" he concluded. </p><p> Silence reigned between them once more because Evie\'s eyes began to become heavy again. The rain that Evie was dreading had also come. It was already cold as it was and now it was raining too! She drew her cloak closer against her chest as she began to feel the dropping temperature when... </p><p> \"Come here,\" the vampire prince said suddenly, causing Evie\'s head to whip towards him. \"Lean on me and sleep.\" </p><p> Evie blinked. She didn\'t expect his offer at all. And her shocked expression sold her out. </p><p> Gavriel\'s face became a few shades darker again at the sight of her reaction and she saw his jaw clench slightly. \"What\'s with that look?\" He narrowed his eyes but in the next moment, he leaned in so close to her that Evie almost gasped. \"Even if you think vampires are cold-blooded monsters, I am not just some vampire to you now. Let me remind you once again,\" his voice hardened, \"that I am also your husband. So stop expecting me to treat you like you\'re my enemy. Are we clear? Evielyn?\" </p><p> His words made her swallow and her heart pounded, but she eventually nodded, and he moved away and ran his fingers through his hair. </p><p> He looked at her again and spoke. This time, his voice was gentler and there was a welcoming expression in his eyes. \"Come, wife. Don\'t worry, I don\'t have any plans to eat you.\" </p>'),(289,13,'Chapter 5 - Journey',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> \"No one\'s allowed to hurt you, not even me. You have nothing to be scared about,\" he added gently and before Evie realized it, as though he had cast a bewitching spell on her, she obeyed. </p><p> He shifted and made room for her and then she found herself half lying on him with her back to his chest and his arm wrapped around her, holding her, keeping her tucked against him as the carriage lurched forward. It seemed her fatigue and dizziness had given her away because of how little resistance she had against his irresistible offer of comfort. The back of her head settled on his solid and hard chest, which suddenly felt like a cushion, as she relaxed comfortably. </p><p> This was the first time she had experienced anything like this. She had never let any man hold her this way before. She found it overwhelming because, even in her lightheaded state, her body reacted in a strange way as he held her. And the most surprising thing was she didn\'t hate it. She had thought she would despise any physical closeness with a vampire so this was surprising. </p><p> However, she brushed it off. She thought that she was feeling this way because of the strange situation she was in. She was perhaps just really exhausted. </p><p> \"You are… warm…\" she muttered in a sleepy voice, her eyes already closed. \"I thought… vampires are cold.\" </p><p> \"I am the only exception,\" he answered and she forced her heavy eyelids to open. </p><p> An amused smile curved on his lips as he watched her forcing herself to open her eyes, struggling to fight her dizziness. \"What do you –\" </p><p> \"Hush…\" His finger almost landed on her lips. \"Sleep. One day, I might tell you,\" he whispered and Evie could no longer fight the call of the god of sleep and finally succumbed to its irresistible invitation. </p><p> … </p><p> When Evie opened her eyes again, daylight was already peeking through the horizon. She blinked groggily and then a second later, realized that she was lying in someone\'s embrace. </p><p> Twisting, she glanced up and a gorgeous face greeted her good morning. Her eyes circled at the sight of the man and almost immediately, she pushed herself away from him so hard that her back hit the wall on the other side of the carriage. </p><p> Deep lines formed on the man\'s smooth forehead, but, \"Good morning, Evielyn,\" he greeted still. He seemed displeased by her reaction. Despite his expression, Evie couldn\'t help but just stare at him. His legs were still parted, one resting on top of the seat and the other hanging down to the floor. Evie knew that he was in that position because he had cradled her in her sleep. And more importantly, he was… oh god… Gavriel, her vampire husband, in daylight was a sight to behold - not that he wasn\'t already - but unlike his angel of the darkness appearance last night, he now looked approachable and almost harmless. It was as if the daylight had turned him into the angel of light or something. Evie could even stare at him longer now without flinching. </p><p> She shut her eyes and then blinked quickly, as if she was trying to wake herself up from having a hallucination, but when she looked at him again, her shoulders dropped, disappointed that she wasn\'t hallucinating at all. Evie couldn\'t help but feel this uneasy feeling in the pit of her stomach. This was not supposed to happen. She was not supposed to be admiring any vampire\'s beauty. She was supposed to despise them all. </p><p> \"Good morning, Your… I mean… G-gavriel,\" Evie struggled to respond calmly. </p><p> \"We\'ll stay in this inn until you\'re ready to continue the journey,\" he said as he opened the carriage door and then he jumped down and stretched out his hand towards her. </p><p> Hesitantly, Evie put her hand on his and he gently helped her down. Since the moment he had held her hand at the altar, this man, she noticed, always held onto her with an almost exaggerated gentleness - something she never, ever expected from her vampire husband. </p><p> \"Make sure to take your time and rest properly,\" he said, causing Evie to look up at the inn in front of them before she looked around. </p><p> \"Have we already crossed the border?\" she asked. She was glad that the rain had stopped and the weather was looking fine again. </p><p> \"Yes. This inn is the last place where you can take a comfortable rest. It\'ll be a long stretch of traveling after this. It will take longer for us to cross the Dark Valley and reach the next village than the journey so far, so make sure to have a proper rest. We should be able to stay here for at least three hours, longer if needed,\" he said as he led her inside the inn. </p><p> The innkeepers welcomed them. They were both gray-haired and wrinkly with old age but what Evie noticed, with mild surprise, was that they were humans. They smiled at her but then, they also smiled at her husband! They were polite towards Gavriel and it seemed to her that they knew he was a vampire prince. It was completely unexpected. Evie had never seen any human not cower in fear in the presence of a vampire, let alone greet them politely. Shaking her head at the unbelievable scene that just played out before her, she walked in almost a tranced state towards her room. </p><p> Evie had eaten her meal inside her private room alone. Her husband didn\'t come back to check on her - or maybe he did but she just missed it because she might have already been fast asleep on the bed. </p><p> Before the wedding day, Evie had actually travelled for many days to reach Rennox Castle where their wedding had taken place. </p><p> The house of Ylvia was in the Southern Empire and the human emperors couldn\'t allow the vampires to set foot down South so they brought Evie to the Eastern empire, to a citadel closest to the northern border. It had been a long journey. Although she rested for a couple of days before the vampires arrived, Evie\'s fatigue from the last uncomfortable journeys had still not fully recovered. And now, she was going on a new journey again. A journey that she would never, ever forget. </p><p> ... </p><p> After napping for about two hours, Evie woke up and readied herself for the long journey ahead. She had a small chat with the old innkeeper when the old lady had brought her meal in and she had told her that they needed to cross the Dark Valley before the day ended because that place was very dangerous. She said that the Dark Valley was a peculiar dark forest through and through. Evie had also heard before from one of their soldiers that the Dark Valley was the place where the vampires loved to ambush the human soldiers in every war. It was said to be the first and hardest hurdle for humans to cross every time they invaded the vampire\'s land. The innkeeper also told her that at night, the place would be filled with the notorious beasts coming from the Middle Land. </p><p> Evie didn\'t want to encounter any beasts. Vampires were already killing her with fear so she didn\'t want to see one of those creatures too! She already had enough \'excitement\' in the last twenty-four hours to last her a lifetime without adding that to the list! If that did happen, she didn\'t know if she would reach the vampire\'s imperial palace without fainting from fright! Worse yet, she might not even reach the vampire\'s land alive if those beasts attacked them! The vampires that were present at their wedding were all gone. The only ones left in their party was herself, the vampire prince and the vampire coachman. Why on Earth did everyone else leave them? Wasn\'t her husband a prince? </p><p> Human princesses and princes, even she, a noble\'s daughter, had knights or guards that were appointed to stay by their side whenever they travelled anywhere. Even though she didn\'t like it sometimes, she knew it was a safety precaution. But with this vampire prince - they all just abandoned him! Was it because they thought he didn\'t need protection? </p><p> Evie couldn\'t come up with a reasonable conclusion. But then, she thought that the vampires might have a different system or maybe the prince she had married was probably so powerless that his emperor didn\'t even bother to give him any guards. Evie had heard about powerless princes like that, especially ones who were born from concubines and maids. This thought worried Evie even more. They really needed to cross the border before daylight faded to avoid those dangerous beasts! </p><p> \"Are you sure you don\'t want to stay longer? We can continue the journey this afternoon or even at night,\" a deep, pleasing voice echoed inside the room and when Evie looked over her shoulder, she saw the alluringly gorgeous creature, her vampire husband, looking at her as he leaned against the door frame. She didn\'t notice his arrival or his presence at all. </p><p> \"I-it\'s fine. I prefer travelling during the day,\" she said, averting her gaze from him. \"I\'m ready.\" </p><p> Her firm answer made his right eyebrow twitch slightly as he watched her but eventually, he let out a quiet sigh before he finally relented. </p><p> As they both left the inn, Evie looked back and saw the old human couple step out as well to send them off. Evie waved at the human couple before she entered the carriage, wondering if they would be the last humans she would see on this journey. But then she remembered that the vampires agreed to give her human servants because the vampires had many human slaves in their land. That thought somehow made her feel less apprehensive. </p><p> But her ease and the little energy she gathered from her rest abruptly evaporated. The road through the Dark valley was brutal. It was obvious that this road wasn\'t used often. In fact, it must\'ve been a long while since the last carriage passed through it. The vehicle jolted and swayed until Evie began to feel nauseous. All the uncomfortable traveling she had endured in the last few days until that dawn was nothing compared to this. </p><p> Although the vampire prince wasn\'t as miserable as Evie, he, too, had acquired a little rumpled appearance. The deep lines on his forehead seemed to have been permanently carved on his gorgeous forehead since the carriage started to bounce on and on. It was obvious he badly wanted to leave the carriage and walk or leap or run instead. </p><p> But he couldn\'t, knowing that his wife would surely fall on the floor and bump her head on every wall of the carriage like a pinball, without him there. Since the carriage had entered the Dark Valley, Gavriel had caught her from nearly falling on the carriage\'s floor twice before he decided to sit next to her and hold her waist. </p><p> \"Shall we take a break?\" he asked her after an hour, but Evie shook her head. </p><p> \"No, let\'s keep going.\" She remained willful despite the look on her face. </p><p> But after another hour, the vampire prince asked again. </p><p> When Evie still shook her head and told him to keep going, a slight smirk curved on Gavriel\'s face. </p><p> \"I didn\'t know human females could be this stubborn. You\'re clearly having a hard time yet you\'re not even complaining,\" he said with a hint of amusement and wonder in his tone. </p><p> But Evie couldn\'t even form a response. The two hours of the nonstop brutal ride had already exhausted her and her nausea had not subsided since it started. She had never experienced anything like this. Back in the South, as well as when she travelled to Rennox Castle, there were times when the road was bad because of bad weather but they always took a break or made camp and postponed the journey to the next day. But Evie knew she couldn\'t do that this time. They needed to make haste or the beasts might catch them. </p><p> However, after half an hour, Gavriel spoke again. And this time, he didn\'t ask anymore. </p><p> \"Let\'s stop for a while,\" he declared and surprisingly, Evie was very quick to nod. It seemed she had finally reached her limit. The carriage stopped and he quickly helped her out. But as soon as she stepped on the ground and looked around, goosebumps crawled under her skin and she instinctively stepped back. </p>'),(290,13,'Chapter 6 - Unbelievably',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> The sight of her surroundings made her swallow and goosebumps crawled on her skin. It wasn\'t just because of the biting cold, it was mostly because the valley felt absolutely eerie. In fact, eerie might still be an understatement to describe the place. All the countless trees were coal black and leafless as if they were all scorched to death. Black ravens were settled on the tree branches and they all looked like they were staring straight at them. Evie couldn\'t see any plant that seemed to still be alive. </p><p> A thick layer of snow had iced the ground. The fog was also thick that even though it was still morning, it already felt like twilight. It felt like the darkness would soon settle in and she imagined those notorious beasts suddenly appearing from the thick mist surrounding them. </p><p> \"I- I think we should go on,\" she stammered. </p><p> Gavriel\'s head whipped around to face her. </p><p> \"But you\'re clearly –\" </p><p> \"I\'m fine.\" </p><p> \"You\'re not.\" </p><p> Evie met his gaze and was surprised at what she saw in his moon-like eyes. She saw worry in them, a very intense one that Evie froze for a moment. But then she quickly reasoned to herself that this prince must have been worried that she might die or something. She was such a fragile thing in his eyes after all, judging from the overly careful and gentle way he had touched her. </p><p> \"It\'s… cold here… outside,\" she murmured and without waiting for her husband\'s approval, she turned around and climbed back inside the carriage by herself. She would rather endure being uncomfortable inside a moving carriage than stay in a place like this. All she wanted that moment was to finally cross this valley and reach the village, where it was safe. And besides, she had told him the truth; it was freezing. She already felt the biting cold that made her shiver from just stepping out for a moment. </p><p> As she sat in the carriage, she looked at Gavriel and she saw him run his fingers through his hair before he told the coachman to keep going. </p><p> And thus, the journey continued as they rode together in stoic silence. The brutal journey stopped her from thinking and the temperature kept on getting colder and colder as they wound their way deeper and deeper into the Dark Valley. </p><p> Gavriel had wordlessly wrapped her up in a quilted blanket somewhere along the way upon realizing she was starting to shiver. But it wasn\'t enough. Evie was from the Southern Empire, where it was normally warm and sunny. She was not used to being in extreme cold temperatures. She had actually never experienced this level of coldness. The blanket definitely wasn\'t enough to warm her up. </p><p> The extreme cold swallowed Evie\'s fears and reservations and she burrowed even further into the depths of her husband\'s coat. </p><p> \"I\'m relieved,\" he said. </p><p> \"Hm?\" </p><p> \"It seems you\'re not that scared of me anymore.\" </p><p> Evie froze in his arms. He was right… along the way, her heart had stopped hammering with nervousness and fear and she was actually snuggling herself closer to him without reservation now. She was shocked. </p><p> \"It seems you have also shocked yourself.\" </p><p> She felt his chest move beneath her ear in what seemed to be a huff of amusement which made her glance up at his face. </p><p> \"Let me warm your hand,\" he offered as soon as their eyes met. Evie felt her cold ears heat up and averted her gaze but she eventually lifted her hand slowly. </p><p> Without a word, Gavriel took her hand in his and began to rub her palm and cold fingers. His hand was strong, velvety and… warm. </p><p> \"You are… really warm. A-are you really a vampire?\" She snapped her lips shut upon realizing what she just said. </p><p> Gavriel\'s hand also stilled and Evie bit her lip, nervously. \"I\'m sorry. I… it\'s just… I\'m just –\" </p><p> \"I am, Evielyn. There\'s a reason why my body is warm. But I am undoubtedly a vampire.\" </p><p> Evie didn\'t know what to say. She wanted to speak more but she was afraid to offend him or upset him. She didn\'t want to anger him. She didn\'t want to see his eyes turn red or for him to bare his fangs. She thought she might not be able to survive this journey if that happened. She might die from both fear and the freezing cold. </p><p> Feeling Evie\'s body stiffen, possibly more from her comment than the cold, Gavriel resumed toying with her hand, surprising her once again. It seemed he was not offended and she couldn\'t hold herself from letting out a sigh of great relief. He started to lace their fingers together and then he pressed his thumb lightly on her palm with a deliberate gentleness. It was unbelievably soothing that Evie couldn\'t help but enjoy it. She never thought she would find herself in this situation and she never, ever thought she would like it and would feel secure in his arms, in a vampire\'s arms. She had prepared herself to live in a nightmare but why did this feel like a dream? She couldn\'t help but think she must be dreaming. </p><p> The feeling was so good that Evie managed to doze off just before he ceased his playing. Still, he kept her fingers folded in his. </p><p> However, after enjoying the blissful nap, she was jolted awake because of the sudden and violent pause of the carriage. Even though Gavriel had held her firmly to stop her from getting hurt by the violent movement, Evie still yelped in shock. </p><p> And then, there was an eerie silence. She looked at her husband with wide eyes but the man remained calm. He held her shoulders and whispered, \"don\'t be afraid. Just stay inside. I\'ll get rid of them. Don\'t even try to peek because you might not like what you will see.\" </p><p> Before she could even make a sound, Gavriel had already opened the door and swiftly jumped down, closing the door firmly behind his back. </p>'),(291,13,'Chapter 7 - Over',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> Bone-chilling growls filled Evie\'s ears as soon as the carriage door was closed. Her eyes were still wide and her hand was left hanging in midair in a failed attempt to stop her husband from leaving. She knew by the monstrous sounds alone that the beasts had come. Why? It was not even nighttime yet! </p><p> Evie\'s throat ran dry. Her face became even paler as she noticed the sounds becoming louder and louder. The beasts were approaching closer and it seemed that there weren\'t just two or three of them. It sounded like a whole tribe had come for them. Her hands flew to her heart as the fear spread throughout her entire body. What was going to happen? Was she going to die here? </p><p> Dull sounds of what seemed like a sword slashing into flesh filled the air and the growls became more violent. She felt the earth-shaking thuds which caused the carriage to shake. She wanted to hear Gavriel\'s voice but all she could hear was the overwhelming sounds of battle that she never wanted to hear. \"Please, don\'t get hurt! You can\'t leave me here alone! Let me know you\'re still there!\" Evie murmured as she trembled on the carriage floor. </p><p> Crouching on the floor, Evie crawled towards the door with what little strength she could muster. Her mind and body were becoming numb from both fear and the cold. All she wanted in that moment was to know that her husband was still alive. The loud, barbaric noises faded into the background in her hazy mind as she concentrated on getting to the door to look for her husband. </p><p> With trembling hands, Evie reached for the door but before she could touch it, the carriage shook again from a large something - hopefully a dead beast - crashing against it, causing her to be thrown back to the opposite wall. </p><p> Evie yelped as her body crashed against the wall. It seemed that her nightmare had come to life again - the most terrifying nightmare she had ever had. Years ago, Evie was attacked by vampires while she was traveling and after that experience, she had re-lived that moment many times in her nightmares. But at that time, her mother was with her and many guards traveled with them for protection. The fight back then was fierce and Evie was terrified but her mother had held her in her embrace the entire time, reassuring her that their guards were amazing soldiers and that they would be okay, until the fight was over. </p><p> This time was completely different. She had no one to hold onto. No one was with her in this horrifying situation telling her that she was going to be okay, that they would defeat their enemies and even more terrifying was that she knew they had no guards. Even if her husband was a vampire prince, could he really go against that many beasts and survive? What if… what if her husband was already… </p><p> The fear in her heart was too much and it was getting harder for her to breathe. Still, she crawled towards the door again but the moment she touched the door, she noticed that her world became eerily quiet. Tremors shook Evie\'s body and she swallowed. What happened? Was it over? Was he all right? </p><p> Evie bit her trembling lips and she pushed the door open. The freezing wind welcomed her but she didn\'t freeze because of the cold, she froze upon seeing what lay before her. </p><p> Huge, furry, bloody, ash-colored beasts were scattered on the ground. They looked like gigantic wolves. Body parts of the beasts were scattered all along the white snow painting the ground red where they lay. Evie also spotted a leg of a man which she assumed, even prayed to be the coachman\'s and not her husband\'s, next to one of the beast\'s heads. The sight made the already pale Evie turn almost as white as a sheet of paper. The gore that was spread before her eyes made her body feel completely numb that she didn\'t know if she was still breathing. </p><p> And then, there he was, the vampire prince she had wanted to see. He was standing in the middle of three huge beasts that had fallen around him. He stood as still as a painting, chest heaving from the exertion as he scanned his surroundings, holding his sword upright before him. His sword was painted scarlet and his black coat was dancing in the wind behind him. </p><p> When he turned and looked at her, the world screeched into a halt. His eyes that used to look like a calming pair of silver moons were gone. They were replaced by an intense and bloody-red pair of eyes. Those were the eyes of the monsters in both her reality and nightmares. She felt like the god of death was staring at her and her body fell backwards onto the carriage floor. </p><p> When he moved towards her, Evie\'s body instinctively retreated until her back hit the opposite wall of the carriage. She was like a little bunny trembling in fear because a savage wolf had spotted her and was now approaching her to tear her down and make her his meal. </p><p> The man halted for a few seconds at the sight of her reaction but then he continued approaching the carriage, stopping by the door. Evie had her face buried against her knees, as if not seeing him would lessen her fear. She hugged herself in a fetal position, trembling uncontrollably. </p><p> Gavriel stared at her and the sight of her made him think that she was like a little white bunny cowering in fear because a hungry wolf had cornered her to her demise. His jaws clenched but he remained calm as he quietly cleaned and sheathed his sword. </p><p> He remained standing by the door. \"Evielyn,\" he called out. His voice was gentle. \"It\'s over. There\'s no need to be scared now. I\'m here, don\'t be scared.\" </p>'),(292,13,'Chapter 8 - Youre Late',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> The poor little bunny moved and peeked at him through her silver-blond locks but the moment their eyes met, she flinched and buried her face again. </p><p> Gavriel\'s eyebrows twitched from the realization that the bunny was scared of him, not at the dead beasts that were scattered around him. He shut his eyes and when he opened them again, his eyes were no longer red. He ran his fingers through his hair and patiently, he tried to coax the bunny once more. </p><p> Slowly, he climbed inside the carriage, moving very carefully as he approached and squatted before her. </p><p> \"The beasts are dead. You\'re safe now. No one can hurt you,\" he said, but the girl still didn\'t move. Gavriel knew that there was no way it would be easy for this little terrified bunny to crawl back to him again after what she saw. However, he could see that she was on the verge of freezing herself to death. Glancing at the crumpled blanket on the carriage floor, Gavriel picked it up. \"At least take this blanket, Evielyn.\" </p><p> \"Come, let\'s warm you up before you freeze to death. I am at least warmer than the carriage floor,\" his voice was low and gentle and almost hypnotic that his voice managed to penetrate Evie\'s still numbed body and mind. </p><p> \"Y-y-your eyes,\" she finally uttered between her trembling teeth without looking at him, her voice barely a whisper. </p><p> Gavriel brows momentarily creased but he immediately realized what she was trying to say. \"They are not red anymore. Why don\'t you have a look and see?\" </p><p> Unexpectedly, she lifted her face and looked at him much quicker than he would have thought. </p><p> She stared at him and then suddenly, her body swayed as if she was about to faint. Gavriel caught her shoulder as she began to sway and he held her steady. He settled himself next to where she was sitting and then picked her up and placed her on his lap. He removed his cloak and the blanket before he pressed her against his chest. He realized just how cold her body had become as he wrapped his arms around her and gave her back a quick rub to get some heat into her. She was warm and fine when he had left her. His forehead creased with worry as he quickly wrapped her up with the blanket and then his cloak. He grabbed her hands, which had turned ice cold, and began to rub them in an effort to warm them up. </p><p> He never thought she would easily become this icy in such a short period of time. He knew humans, especially women, were frail creatures but it seemed this bunny was way weaker than he expected; so weak that it seemed even such a short exposure to the cold temperature was enough to beat her up. </p><p> After some time, the girl in his arms finally started to warm up again. She had lost consciousness shortly after he placed her on his lap and he didn\'t know if it was because of the cold or the shock or both. He felt her steady breathing and he let out a sigh of relief but then, his eyes became as sharp as his blade the moment the carriage door was opened. </p><p> A huge, long haired man, wearing a black cloak identical to his, stood by the door. He looked like he was about to speak but was immediately silenced by Gavriel\'s deadly gaze. </p><p> \"You\'re late, Samuel,\" Gavriel said in a low and calm voice that made not just the huge man called Samuel, but the other four men outside the carriage, flinch from obvious fear. </p><p> \"Apologies, Your Highness.\" The huge man bowed in apology when someone butted in from behind Samuel. </p><p> \"Please don\'t blame Samuel, Your Highness. I was the one who insisted that the human lady would still be resting in that inn. But it turned out my prediction was wrong,\" said the lean and brown-haired, intelligent looking man, named Zolan. </p><p> Gavriel sighed. He understood why his men would think that way because even he was surprised when Evielyn insisted on continuing the journey after only a couple of hours\' rest. He thought his wife would delay the journey as much as she could since it was obvious enough that she was scared. But, she did the opposite of what he had expected. </p><p> \"Enough.\" Gavriel lifted his free hand, ignoring the curious and surprised look in his men\'s eyes as they looked at the way he was holding his wife. \"Do you think this carriage can still cross the valley?\" </p><p> Samuel shook his head. \"I\'m afraid our only option now is to carry her.\" </p><p> \"She won\'t withstand the cold,\" Gavriel said. </p><p> Seeing their prince\'s expression as he said those words, the men set a quick glance at each other. </p><p> \"Then, shall I and Levy go to the village to fetch a new carriage?\" suggested Zolan. </p><p> \"No.\" Gavriel rejected his suggestion and then fell silent as he stared at the woman wrapped in his arms. After a while, he lifted his face back to his men and commanded. \"Remove all your cloaks.\" </p>'),(293,13,'Chapter 9 - Slow',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> The men creased their brows, with heads cocked to one side. However, despite the confusion which were visibly portrayed on their faces, everyone immediately obeyed and took off their cloaks. </p><p> \"Give them to me,\" Gavriel ordered and once again, the men glanced at each other, except Samuel who had kept his eyes set on the vampire prince. </p><p> One by one, the men approached the carriage, single file and handed their cloaks which they had flicked off earlier to remove any dust and dirt and all neatly folded, to their prince. The vampire prince\'s face was so serious that no one dared question what he was about to do. The men could only wait to see what he intended to do with all those cloaks. And then, they watched him carefully and slowly wrapped the human girl with their cloaks. </p><p> Their eyes widened in shocked surprise, mouths hanging open speechlessly. Their prince was moving so damned slowly that to them, a turtle might be moving faster than him. Vampires move quick and it was no difference for this prince. In fact, Prince Gavriel\'s speed was actually unmatched so just watching him now moving so excruciatingly slow had them almost gasping as though they would get heart attacks. Why? Why did he need to move so exaggeratedly slow like that? </p><p> No matter how these men try to reason out their prince\'s action, they couldn\'t understand. They knew about female humans being frail but wasn\'t he being a little too much? Or was he afraid to wake her up? But why would he be afraid to wake her up? They couldn\'t think of any answer that was logical enough for them. </p><p> The five able bodied vampires were all scowling as they remained still, watching the oh-so-slow-moving show before them. They never knew something like this would frustrate them to no end. Even though they were only watching. </p><p> After what felt like an eternity, the prince finally managed to put on the last cloak around the human girl. The vampires silently and collectively breathed out their held breaths, it was as if there was an inaudible \'at long last\' that was released simultaneously, in their minds. </p><p> Now completely wrapped up in thick and all-black garments, Gavriel double checked to make sure that the girl was covered properly from head to toe before he finally lifted his face. He moved out of the carriage with the girl in his arms and spoke. </p><p> \"We will travel slowly,\" he ordered and with that, he leapt. His men trailed closely after him, happy to be finally moving again. </p><p> But then, after a few minutes, his men found themselves scowling at their situation once again. They couldn\'t help it. It was because the \'slow\' their prince had mentioned wasn\'t even the kind of slow that they or all vampires knew. This was… bloody, bloomin\' slow… </p><p> \'Man… what\'s going on with His Highness? Was he perhaps thinking that the girl would die if he sped up a little?\' the jolly-looking man named Levy was saying those words to his comrades through his eyes. He wouldn\'t dare whisper because the prince would definitely hear. Vampires could speak with each other through telepathy as long as they looked directly into each other\'s eyes. </p><p> Levy\'s comrades simply shrugged but their expressions all indicated that the same thoughts were running through their minds as well. They were among the best of all the vampire warriors – the elites. They never, ever travelled or moved this slowly in their entire lives! They didn\'t even know that something like this would actually frustrate them so badly until now that they were seeing and experiencing it first-hand. </p><p> \'Bloody hell! Zolan, tell his highness that the girl will definitely not die if we sped up a little! For goodness\' sake. This is too much!\' Levy complained again. </p><p> \'Why don\'t you tell him yourself?\' Zolan responded with a devil-may-care look on his face. </p><p> Frustrated, Levy turned his gaze to his stoic looking comrade named Luc, who gave the same reaction. </p><p> \'Ugh, you do it Reed!\' Levy said to the youngest looking one but the man named Reed, just blinked innocently and averted his gaze away, ignoring Levy. </p><p> \'His Highness is acting strange! What the hell happened to him? Did the humans do something to him? One of us should\'ve at least escorted him when he set foot in the human\'s land!\' Levy continued complaining, leaping or bouncing backwards while facing his comrades. </p><p> \'It\'s not like this is the first time His Highness set foot in the human\'s land. He\'d even reached the Southern empire a few times,\' Zolan replied. </p><p> \'But this is the first time he lingered inside a human\'s castle. What if –\" </p><p> \'Stop it Levy, His Highness is not a fool to let anyone do such a thing to him. And do you really think any human can do anything to His Highness?\' </p><p> \'But…\' Levy pressed his lips together and shook his head in frustration as they continued the most frustrating travel they ever encountered in their lives. </p><p> … </p><p> When Evie opened her eyes, she was in blissful ignorance for a few sweet moments. It felt like she had awakened from a very deep sleep. She blinked owlishly without moving for a while and when she turned around, she immediately stiffened. </p><p> A man was lying next to her, and he was… naked. Evie\'s eyes widened as she rose. She was about to yelp in alarm but as her eyes jumped to the man\'s face, she froze. </p><p> The memories came flooding in. Everything, since the night of her wedding, the blood and gore, up till she passed out inside the carriage. Her chest tightened so hard that she had to desperately drag air into her lungs. </p><p> When breathing slowly became easier, Evie swallowed hard as she gazed at the man, her vampire husband\'s face. His appearance when he had those terrifying bloody-red eyes suddenly flashed in her mind, and a shiver travelled up her spine. The thought of wanting to run away and escape came to her, but her mind quickly dismissed it, reminding her that she had nowhere else to run and there was nothing she could do. </p><p> She took a deep breath, trying to find her control as her eyes remained fixated on her husband\'s face. The longer she stared at his breathtaking face, Evie somehow felt it helped her calm down. She didn\'t know how but it seemed his beauty had miraculously settled the fear in her heart. Was it because he looked so peaceful, innocent and harmless while asleep? </p><p> Evie bit her lips as she forced herself to stop being mesmerized by the vampire prince\'s beauty. But before she could force her eyes off him, she was reminded of his nakedness and her eyes circled once again. Her face burned while her eyes literally inched from his face downwards, to his neck then his muscular and lean chest, and then his perfect abs that were half covered by the blanket. Evie\'s lips subconsciously parted, utterly distracted and mesmerized until something registered in her that drove the blood out of her face. </p><p> Her eyes whipped towards herself and when she saw that she was fully dressed, she finally let out the breath she didn\'t know she was holding in. </p>'),(294,13,'Chapter 10 - Are We Clear',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> Evie frantically surveyed herself. There seemed to be nothing unusual with her body. The vampire prince didn\'t seem to have done anything to her while she was asleep, she just somehow knew it. </p><p> She looked at his sleeping face again and her shoulders relaxed. A long sigh escaped her lips before she looked around the room. It was vast and the windows were covered with thick maroon curtains. The ceiling was also very high. It was a little dark but Evie could tell it was daylight. How long did she sleep? Was she in the village across the Dark Valley? </p><p> But judging from the size of this room, it somehow seemed to be a master room of a huge castle. Was there a huge castle in the very first village across the border? Or could it be that this wasn\'t the village anymore? </p><p> The thought that she was finally in the foreign land, the land she and all her friends used to imagine as a place as good as hell, made her subconsciously hug herself. She didn\'t tremble in fear but there was a peculiar churning in the pit of her stomach – the fear of the known and unknown making her heart convulse with unease again. What was going to happen to her in this land of bloodsuckers? She even chuckled wryly in her mind – they were true and living bloodsuckers, in the literal sense sand not just a figure of speech. </p><p> \"You\'re finally awake,\" a pleasant and husky voice made her shoulders jolt and her spine straighten. Her head whipped towards the glorious man, but his back was already facing her as he rose from the bed. </p><p> Evie couldn\'t help but feel her ears burn hot at the sight of his broad and perfectly chiselled back. She was glad his lower half was fully clothed. She watched him as he gracefully walked towards the large windows and pulled the curtain slightly open, just enough for the light to brighten up the room. </p><p> The light came streaming in and it slightly blinded Evie. But good lord… Evie couldn\'t help but gape because the man was more blinding than the light. And she couldn\'t even scold herself and tell herself that she was being ridiculous. Because she knew she wasn\'t, and it wasn\'t fair! Thank god she managed to maintain a shred of dignity by keeping her mouth from shamelessly hanging open. </p><p> It was all she could do to drag her eyes away from him. She was mortified because she thought she had expected to be unable to look into any vampire\'s face. Who would\'ve thought she would actually find herself struggling to look away instead? This was… ridiculously unbelievable! </p><p> \"Are you alright?\" the face she was trying so hard to look away from suddenly appeared right before her and she almost gasp. \"You\'ve been sleeping since yesterday, Evielyn.\" He added and Evie almost believed the worried look on his face. But she wouldn\'t dare. She wouldn\'t dare believe that he was really concerned about her, even his gentleness and care for her since their wedding until that brutal journey. </p><p> She wouldn\'t dare believe all of those gentlemanly actions were sincere. Because Evie had been warned beforehand by her parents and the emperors to remain vigilant and careful because the vampires would surely try everything to win her trust and then extract information from her. After all, the humans knew that the vampires would remain suspicious about the real reason behind the truce the humans had offered. They weren\'t idiots after all. They were intelligent and sly creatures as the emperors called them. They would go as far as to use their beauty and charm to bewitch the poor humans to their submission. And Evie had vowed not just to her parents and the emperors but also to herself that she would never, ever, let any vampire fool or bewitch her, not even this prince, her very own husband. </p><p> \"I am fine.\" Evie replied and she couldn\'t believe she was staring back at him and with a hard glare too. \"Y-you… why…you,\" she breathed, \"are… sleeping next to me?\" Evie stuttered out the thought that was plaguing her but was so disconcerted that her sentence came out weird. </p><p> The pair of moon-like eyes slightly widened and then narrowed at her. The next moment, he was right before Evie\'s face. His hands already on the bed as he leaned over her. Evie held her breath. The sight of him that day in the Dark Valley flashed in her mind and her body tensed up. </p><p> \"Why?\" he echoed, the corner of his lips twitching in disbelief. \"You are asking me why I\'m sleeping next to you?\" his voice was unexpectedly calm but Evie had heard a note of something like rage or great displeasure buried in his pleasing deep voice. </p><p> Evie gulped, her mouth opened and then shut. She suddenly didn\'t know what to say. It was as if her mind failed her as soon as she looked in his eyes. And all she did was watch him as those silver discs shuttered and let out a quiet breath right before her face. She subconsciously jerked backwards when her mind registered his cool breath fanning across her cheeks. </p><p> His eyes flashed open at her sudden movement and stared at her again, silently but intensely before he bit his lower lip in exasperation. \"Are you still not fully awake? Fine.\" He nodded as if trying to reason with himself. \"I am sleeping next to you because I am your husband and you are my wife.\" He told her in a serious but almost mocking voice. </p><p> Evie was forced to look away because staring back at those pair of silvery moon eyes were too distracting for her. She can\'t let herself be rendered mute by his gaze. She must respond. But before she could open her mouth, the vampire prince\'s spoke again. </p><p> \"Say, Evielyn,\" his eyes brooded. \"The deal was that I am not allowed to touch you without your consent, and I promised to respect that and will never force myself on you or harm you. But it seems as if the meaning of those words to you isn\'t the same as what I understood? The way you are reacting is as though I am not allowed to stay in the same room and lay in the same bed as you, am I right? Evielyn?\" </p><p> He bit his lips again, this time harder. Evie stiffened because she felt the atmosphere turned heavy. Worry began to consume her, scared that his eyes would turn red. But it didn\'t. </p><p> \"Listen,\" his voice became calm, utterly calm. \"If that\'s your understanding, then I apologize, my wife. But I\'ll have you understand that it is totally off the mark and I\'m not going to buy such nonsense. You and I are married, therefore, we shall stay in the same room and lay in the same bed. Are we clear?\" </p>'),(295,13,'Chapter 11 - RIP',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Evie felt her throat dry up. But before she could even form any verbal or physical response, her stomach suddenly growled. Her face turned red, and she immediately looked down in embarrassment while Gavriel blinked and pressed his lips together as his eyes travelled down her stomach.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Evie\'s stomach growled again. Evie couldn\'t see his expression, but she finally felt him pull away and heard him calling for the maids.</p><p>Gavriel grabbed a robe and was putting it on when the door opened. When Evie raised her head towards the door, surprise colored her face at the sight of two women dressed in black and white maid outfits.</p><p>\"H-humans?\" she muttered as she looked at Gavriel with wide eyes.</p><p>\"Don\'t tell me you can\'t recognize your fellow human?\" Gavriel looked at her with a quizzical look. The displeasure on his face was gone.</p><p>\"O-of course I can. It\'s just that… I just…\" Evie was so shocked. She didn\'t know what to say. Everything… the opposites of her expectations kept on happening. She could tell that the two ladies were humans in one glance but Evie couldn\'t help but doubt because the girls were… they were fine, very healthy and even looking bright and cheerful. This was an absolute shock. She was expecting to be served by humans alone because that was included on the deal but she thought her servants would probably look awful because they were supposed to be treated as slaves who were forced to provide blood and sexual pleasures for the vampires. So why? How come? How could they look so fine and healthy as if they were living their lives happily in this land?</p><p>\"Good day my lady,\" said one of the girls. They were both red-haired, but one had long braided hair while the other one had a shorter hair neatly tied-up into a ponytail. \"My name is Fray.\" Introduced the long haired one and \"My name is Gina,\" introduced the short-haired one. \"We are so pleased to finally meet you and serve you my lady.\" They bowed at her.</p><p>Evie momentarily struggled to find her voice. \"Nice to meet you too, Gina, Fray.\" She managed to say. Her mind was still whirling with questions, but even though this was totally unexpected, she was still feeling very glad and relieved. She didn\'t know how would react if these two girls would appear in front of her in the conditions she had been imagining and expecting.</p><p>\"Help my wife get ready and immediately bring her to the dining hall.\" Gavriel\'s pleasant voice echoed and the maids immediately bowed at him. Evie noticed the maids never looked directly into the vampire prince\'s face.</p><p>\"Yes, Your Highness.\" They said, simultaneously before they approached Evie and led her towards a door that appeared to be the bathroom.</p><p>Evie glanced back and when her eyes met Gavriel\'s, she abruptly looked away. She didn\'t like her body\'s reactions towards him. She was confused on how his gaze seemed to be affecting her in some strange but surprisingly not unwelcomed way.</p><p>And she was still stunned at his words right before her stomach growled. The look in his eyes as he said those words stirred something inside her and an emotion close to alarm had hit her.</p><p>Since even her husband couldn\'t touch her without her permission, Evie had never bothered thinking about herself as a wife or her life as a married woman. She never thought about any of that. Because she knew this wasn\'t a normal marriage. In fact, this was the first time in history where a vampire and a human were ever joined in marriage. Everyone, even her parents and herself included, had also expected that her soon to be husband wouldn\'t even want to be with her anyway since he already knew about the deal that he could not touch her as he wished. She had also expected that he would ignore her, send her to a separate or a secluded palace while he continued enjoying his life as usual, as if he wasn\'t married at all. So why? Why did he say those words? Why did he want to stay with her and even sleep in the same bed with her?</p><p>\"My lady, are you okay?\" Fray asked and when Evie saw the worried look on the maid\'s face, she immediately composed herself.</p><p>\"I… I\'m fine. I think I am just hungry,\" she smiled, and the maids relaxed. \"Where did you both come from? Were you from the Eastern empire?\" Evie then asked as the maids hovered around her.</p><p>\"No, my lady. Me and Fray were both born here.\"</p><p>\"R-really?\" Evie was surprised. She was shocked but just barely managed to keep her composure and tried not to be so obvious.</p><p>\"Yes. My grandmother was from the Western Empire,\" said Fray. \"And my father is from the Eastern,\" continued Gina. \"So, we have never ever set foot in any human lands yet, my lady. That\'s why we were so excited to meet you when His Highness told us about you.\"</p><p>Evie wanted to ask more about Fray\'s grandmother and Gina\'s father, but she refrained. Because she remembered her father and the emperors\' stern words that she must not fully trust the human servants that would be assigned to her. Evie thought that made sense, considering that these maids were born in this land. Their loyalty might be completely for the vampires or worse, they might be under the vampires\' spell. \"He told you about me? When?\"</p><p>\"Just a couple of days ago, My lady.\"</p><p>\"Were you both servants of the prince for a long time?\"</p><p>\"Yes. My parents were gardeners here.\"</p><p>\"I see.\" Evie nodded and she focused her gaze on the water. She wanted to probe further but she stopped herself. She still had many opportunities to question them. For now, she would try observing them and behave as normal as she could around them.</p><p>As Evie was led by the maids out of the master\'s room, her eyes didn\'t stop looking around. The corridor outside the room was spacious and there were chandeliers hanging above the high ceiling.</p><p>A door at the end of the corridor seemed to be leading to an open veranda that would surely be the perfect place to enjoy a view. In Evie\'s mind, she imagined it to be a place where one could sit back, relax and enjoy the view of the beautiful garden while having a nice cup of tea. Her family\'s castle back in the Southern Empire had a remarkable garden she always adored and spent whatever free time she could in there.</p><p>\"Where is this place?\" Evie asked her maids as they descended a spiraled stairway. \"We\'re not in the imperial capital yet, right?\"</p><p>Fray and Gina looked at her with confusion and then in surprise. But they eventually smiled. \"You\'re already in the imperial capital my lady. This is the prince\'s palace.\"</p><p>Evie halted for a moment before she continued walking. So that\'s why this place was quite extravagant and huge. Even more beautiful than Castle Ylvia, her home. But how did she arrive in this place so soon? It should not be possible with the speed they were going using the carriage, could it? Did Gavriel ended up carrying her all the way from the Dark Valley to the imperial capital? But he did say it was too dangerous for her. So how did he transport her here so quickly?</p><p>Once they arrived in the dining hall, Evie was awed at the sight that greeted her. Her eyes sparkled by observing how intricately well-designed and magnificent the hall was. She had always imagined vampire castles and palaces were places which are somewhat dark, creepy and unpleasant for human habitation but then again, she was proven again and again to be totally wrong in her assumptions so far. The place was very neat and well maintained. In fact, everything was perfect. She even saw a lot of seemingly luxurious materials that she had never seen inside the grand palace in Southern empire. It seemed vampires loved beautiful residences that screamed with elegance and luxury.</p><p>Gavriel was sitting at the head of a table that was long enough to seat twenty adults. His moon-like eyes locked onto her the moment she entered the hall\'s double doors.</p><p>Quietly and a little nervously, Evie sat next to him. Her movements were stiff and awkward. Never in her wildest dreams – or perhaps nightmare, did she think they would actually sit down and dine together. When she had a meal before crossing the Dark Valley, he didn\'t join her.</p><p>The prince didn\'t speak but Evie could feel his piercing gaze on her face. She could not bring herself to raise her face to look at him.</p><p>\"Evielyn…\"</p><p>\"Yes?!\" Evie instantly exclaimed, flinching at the same time as she was jolted by his deep voice calling her name and ended up looking at him.</p><p>A heavy silence permeated the hall as their eyes locked before the glorious prince caught his lips between his teeth. His pleasant and calm expression had darkened a little.</p><p>Realizing that her reaction displeased him, Evie swallowed and nervously retracted her gaze to the juicy and delicious looking steak in front of her. Her mouth watered and her empty stomach screamed at her, momentarily distracting her from her predicament.</p><p>She was so hungry that the sight of the juicy steak seemed to momentarily overshadow the effects that Gavriel\'s presence wrecked on her. Her hands moved on their own and then landed on the table, her gaze not leaving the inviting steak. When she was about to reach out for the utensils prepared for her, someone took the steak away. Her eyes widened as she followed it until Gavriel placed it before him.</p><p>Evie\'s lips parted as she blinked at him. She was speechless and was in a daze when the prince began to slice the steak silently. He looked serious and graceful. How could he make cutting steak look like it was some kind of honorable task?! Wait! That\'s not the issue here. Why did he take the steak away from her?!</p><p>When he stabbed a piece of the steak with his fork, Evie couldn\'t help but follow it as he moved it. The steak stopped right before his lips and the sight of his thin lips jolted Evie awake. She couldn\'t believe what she was doing! But before she could look away, he had stretched out his hand and the piece of steak was suddenly near her mouth.</p><p>The delicious smell made her mouth water even more.</p><p>Her eyes were wide as she looked at him. What was he doing?</p><p>\"Open your mouth, wife.\" He said, his expression soft and his eyes seemed to be smiling at her. Evie\'s jaw dropped the moment she realized he was trying to feed her.</p><p>He mistook that action as her opening her mouth voluntarily and he moved the steak closer. The tender meat brushed lightly against her lips and before she knew it her lips opened, and red, plump lips greedily took the steak into her mouth. She shocked herself at what she did but before she could even scold herself for giving in so easily to the temptation, the heavenly taste of that single piece of meat in her mouth made her forget about everything else. Oh god! This is the most delicious steak she had ever tasted in her life.</p><p>The prince momentarily stilled at the sight of Evie\'s reaction. And when she closed her eyes as if she was savoring something divine, the corner of his lips curved up into a slight smile. This was the first time she showed him these expressions. He thought she was incredibly… cute…</p><p>\"You love it?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" Even her voice was now sounding like melting honey. This was unexpected. Gavriel thought she would tense up again or flinch whenever he spoke. But she didn\'t and he smiled again as he speared another slice of steak with his fork and put it at her lips.</p><p>Evie ate the steak without hesitation. \"God, this is so delicious!!\" She sighed in obvious pleasure, making Gavriel\'s slight smile widen even further. He stared at her lips as she slowly chewed the meat and worshiping its taste at the same time, when out of the blue… his thought strayed. He began to imagine how delicious would she be once he finally got a taste of those lips his eyes was trained on. Would she be so delectable he would forget every thought at the very taste of her lips? Would she be that divine ambrosia he would find himself worshipping her?</p><p>A slight tension began to build in his muscles and as he became aware of his body\'s reaction, he froze. He even felt the tiny hairs rising on the back of his neck. \'Heavens,\' Gavriel muttered under his breath. He couldn\'t believe he was having these kind of thoughts and reactions in a place and situation like this. This was the first time something like this happened to him. He even had to force his gaze away from her face to clear his thoughts. But as he fed her another piece of steak, her words truly threw him off.</p><p>\"This is so delicious, definitely the best I ever tasted!\"</p><p>Suddenly, Gavriel found himself glaring daggers at the steak in front of him. As they say, if looks could kill…RIP steak.</p>'),(296,13,'Chapter 12 - Temptation',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> Finally, Evie snapped out from the strange but pleasure-filled induced haze the delicious steak had trapped her in for that duration of time she was savouring it. Every. Single. Bite. She couldn\'t believe she allowed something so basic like food, to take her on a flight into the clouds and made her forget about everything else. However, she comforted herself in the knowledge that though food was basic, but in no means was that piece of steak plain. It was far from plain! </p><p> Also she couldn\'t believe she had allowed herself to be fed like she was a child. And even allowed a prince to… heavens, Evie! </p><p> Stunned, Evie sat there, unmoving, while Gavriel\'s hand was stranded mid-air in his attempt to feed Evie another piece of steak. </p><p> He moved the steak closer to her lips, causing Evie to flinch – again. After which, she winced and quickly shut her eyes and took a deep breath, remembering how her newly minted husband had made that statement about not wanting his wife flinching away from him. With that deep steadying breath, she opened her eyes and bravely lifted her hand and held Gavriel\'s wrist so she could gently move the steak away without it seeming rude or discourteous. </p><p> \"I… I can eat on my own, Your Highness.\" She blushed hard as she stammered those few words out and when she finally realized she was still holding onto his wrist – a very strong yet tantalising wrist she might add – Evie yanked her hand back as if scalded before awkwardly averting her gaze away from him. She was a hundred and one percent convinced that smoke was wafting off her red-hot ears as she felt his gaze on her face. What was she doing? Letting her guard down like that just because of a delicious steak! Was she so easily duped like a child? She never thought there would ever come a day that the temptation of a plate of food could easily win her over – hook, line and sinker! </p><p> \'But that was no ordinary plate of food! That steak was so heavenly it was almost sinful!\' she fell into her old habit of arguing with herself whenever something truly threw her off and completely flustered her thoroughly. However, she failed to realise that this only happens when she is totally comfortable with her surroundings. Back then, in her own home, it was understandable. But now she was in so called \'enemy territories\'. </p><p> While Evie was busy berating herself inwardly, Gavriel leaned back. His smile had long faded because the effect of the food was gone, and the little bunny was wary and on guard again. \'Too bad,\' he thought. He was enjoying feeding her and she was so cute when she was relaxed. He wanted to feed her like that every time they eat together. He wished he could continue feeding her more but looking at her tensed shoulders made him silently back off. </p><p> Without a word, he put the steak in his mouth, using the same fork he used to feed her. He didn\'t see her how she secretly threw a glance at him and was observing how he devoured the piece of steak that had just touched her lips. He also missed seeing how her face flamed red before she practically tore her eyes away from his face and refocused her gaze back on her own plate of food. </p><p> After dinner, the couple had just left the dining hall when Gavriel spoke. </p><p> \"I would like to escort you around the castle, but the emperor had requested for your presence in the imperial palace as soon as you woke up.\" He said and as expected, Evie tensed up. </p><p> She halted and looked at him with eyes wide opened. \"You mean… now?!\" </p><p> \"Yes. Once you\'re ready, I\'m taking you there.\" </p><p> \"But it\'s already dark…\" she bit the inside of her lower lip the moment she realized what she just said. How could she forget that to the vampires, the night was their daylight? </p><p> \"I will show you around the capital on our way there.\" He added. \"You\'re asleep when we arrived so you didn\'t see anything. I think you might like it.\" </p><p> Evie opened her lips, intending to say something but then shut it. Why was she struggling so hard just to think of an excuse that would sound valid enough? Honestly, she didn\'t need to try so hard to come up with any excuses and could just straight-up refuse the \'invitation\'. She was told to refuse and she wanted to! But why couldn\'t she heartlessly say \'no\' as was initially planned? She must refuse! </p><p> But before she could open her lips again, Gavriel was already talking to her maids to prepare her for her first appearance to the emperor. </p><p> \"Yes, Your Highness.\" The duo bowed and they excitedly approached Evie, eyes all sparkly. </p><p> \"W-wait… Gavriel, I…\" </p><p> \"Yes?\" he suddenly leaned closer on her. So close that Evie\'s mind was momentarily dumbfounded once again, with her husband\'s beauty and she forgot what she was about to say. \"Don\'t be scared, I am here to protect you. Now go and get ready, I\'ll wait downstairs.\" </p><p> With that, the man left, leaving Evie silently berating herself again for being so weak – so defenceless against his beauty. Oh please, Evie. You can\'t be so easily swayed like that! You can\'t! You can\'t! She was mentally shaking herself up, hoping to get a firmer grip on her on mind. </p><p> As the maids brought her to her dressing room, Evie\'s mind was busy thinking on how to deal with the temptations. She finally realized her greatest weakness – food and her husband\'s beauty. What should she do to raise her immunity against those two things? Food is an essential! How can she even say \"no\"? </p><p> Evie had cloaked herself in her own world, thinking and thinking on how to solve this matter of hers that she didn\'t realized a long time already went by until Fray\'s voice reached her ears. \"My lady? Are you okay?\" </p><p> She was yanked from her thoughts. \"Yes?\" </p><p> The maid smiled at her. \"We\'re done, My Lady. You are looking so amazing!\" the maids were gushing with praises as she turned around to look at herself in the mirror. Her lips parted in surprise and awe. \"I can\'t wait to see His Highness\' reaction when he sees you!\" </p><p> \"Right,\" Gina piped in. \"Now let\'s go, My Lady. We can\'t let His Highness wait any longer.\" She urged gleefully and Evie could only let them lead her out of the room. </p><p> As she descended the grand staircase, Evie didn\'t know why her heart suddenly picked up the pace and started thudding loudly in her ears. Oh my, was she nervous? Why? Because of Gavriel? Certainly not, right? This must be because she was going to meet the vampire emperor – humanity\'s ultimate enemy. She was not ready for this! Can she still back out of this? Certainly! She could back out when she wanted to. No one in this place could force her, not even Gavriel. </p><p> Evie\'s hands were clutching her gown so hard, her knuckles had turned white. She was too engrossed in her own predicament that she was jolted to awareness when a hand appeared in front of her. She realized she had reached the last steps and when she took the hand and looked up dazedly, warning bells echoed inside her brain, being able to make sense of one word being screamed out – TEMPTATION!! </p>'),(297,13,'Chapter 13 - Ready',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> When Evie stepped out of the castle, she was already wearing the same black cloak that Gavriel and his men were wearing. Her fiery dress and silver hair were now hidden under that thick and luxurious black cloak. </p><p> While Gavriel was speaking with a man who was also wearing the same black cloak, Evie was busy looking around. She turned and looked up. She knew it was dark, but she still couldn\'t help but admire how intricately beautiful the castle grounds were. Even in the dark, it was nonetheless obvious to see how massive the castle was and the garden on the front yard was also vast. Her vivid thoughts could already picture the view of this place in broad daylight and she must admit, this place was more beautiful and bigger than the infamous Lily palace in Southern Empire. As she looked around, she thought that there must have been an error in thinking that the emperor doesn\'t favour Gavriel. He must be the emperor\'s most beloved and that\'s why he was given the most beautiful castle in the empire. </p><p> \"Wife,\" Gavriel pulled her attention back to him as he walked closer to her. \"Before we go, I\'d like you to meet my men,\" he said, and five men stood in a line a few steps away before her. The hoods of their cloaks were down. Evie swallowed inaudibly at their overwhelming presence. Three of them were just as tall as Gavriel but the other two were huge. Evie immediately remembered the huge and terrifying generals that used to accompany her father and the human emperors back in the Southern Empire. In fact, despite looking very relaxed, these five men were emitting a powerful aura that surpassed any human generals she had ever met. </p><p> \"Good evening Your Highness, I am Samuel,\" said the biggest one with long brown hair. The first thing Evie noticed was the two big scars running from the middle of his forehead down to his left cheek. Trying her best not to stare at his scars due to her surprise, Evie\'s curiosity was sparked because it was common knowledge that vampires heal themselves and if they do get healed, they would never be left with scars. So how was it that this man had a scar? </p><p> \"My name is Levy. Nice to meet you My Lady.\" The man with a jolly and friendly smile introduced himself next. His hair was brown as well, but he had a neat haircut that complimented his good looks. The first thing Evie noticed about him was his wide, friendly smile. </p><p> \"I\'m Luc, My Lady.\" The third man was almost as tall as the huge Samuel. He looked aloof and expressionless. His tussled golden hair stood out and Evie thought that his bright hair – though gorgeous – gave quite the exact opposite feel of not complimenting his rather grey personality. </p><p> \"I\'m Zolan, My Lady.\" The fourth man had a lively voice and an energetic smile. He had long blond hair tied loosely behind him and Evie\'s eyes immediately caught the lone golden earing in his ear. </p><p> The last one had an innocent look. He was as tall as the others, but he looked young. His blue eyes and curly ash grey hair were standing out. \"Reed, My Lady,\" he said simply. </p><p> \"N-nice to meet you all.\" Evie was a little confused what was the point of the introductions. Back in the human empires, this wasn\'t a norm. There was no need for a soldier to do any introduction like this unless the person they were serving asked for their names. Moreover, they definitely were not Evie\'s men. They were her husband\'s. Why were they introducing themselves to her? </p><p> As though Gavriel had read her thoughts, the prince spoke. \"These five are my most trusted men and they will be the ones guarding you whenever you venture outside our castle. So, it would be good if you memorized their names and faces.\" </p><p> Evie creased her brows. They were guarding her? Why did she need to be guarded? Vampires cannot touch her and harm her, right? </p><p> Before Evie could ask a question, another man approached them. The man doesn\'t feel intimidating and he wasn\'t a towering tree like Gavriel and the other five. He was wearing a kind smile and his demeanour was almost human-like. He even had the same red hair as her two human maids. Yet clearly, he wasn\'t human. He was a vampire. A weak vampire, maybe? </p><p> \"Meet my butler, Evielyn. He\'ll be your butler from now on as well. Don\'t hesitate to ask him if there is anything that you need.\" Gavriel said and the butler smiled at her. </p><p> \"I am pleased to meet you, Your Highness. I am Elias.\" </p><p> Evie slightly nodded in acknowledgement of his greeting and then Gavriel leaned in on her. \"Are you ready?\" he asked. \"We\'re not going to use a carriage as we are already late. I will be carrying you in my arms, wife.\" </p><p> \"O-okay,\" Evie could only nod and her approval made Gavriel\'s lips curved in a slight smile. Evie avoided looking at his face, so she didn\'t see how his gaze mischievously flickered. </p><p> Without wasting a moment, he bent and lifted her so easily it was as if she was made of paper. \"Wrap your hands around my neck, wife.\" He said gently and Evie obeyed. Her eyes carefully avoided looking at his glorious face. This was the solution she had thought of to avoid temptation. She shouldn\'t look at him longer than necessary. </p><p> Her hands around his neck were so loose that she didn\'t even allow her hands to brush against his naked skin. However, the moment he leapt high above the ground; Evie\'s hands instinctively tightened around his neck. </p><p> She was holding her breath and her eyes were squeezed shut. This was the first time she experienced this. Were they flying?! She had always wondered how flying would be like before but now that she was experiencing it in the flesh, it actually felt scary. </p><p> When she felt him land, Evie let out the breath she wasn\'t even aware she was holding in and prepared herself for another leap. But the man holding her didn\'t move again. </p><p> \"Open your eyes, Evielyn.\" His deep voice echoed, and she slowly opened her eyes. \"I told you I will show you the city while we are on the way there.\" </p><p> \"But… you said we\'re already late.\" </p><p> He smiled at her. The moonlight was so bright that night that she could see his other-worldly face clearly. \"Yes, but it\'s fine. No one can scold us for being late.\" She saw a naughty yet seemingly dangerous glint in his eyes. Why was he so carefree? Weren\'t they going to meet the emperor? He is known to be the most powerful and dangerous being in this empire and perhaps even in the entire continent. </p><p> \"Now look, Evielyn. This is the view of the city at night.\" </p><p> Evie could no longer resist. She slowly turned her head away from him and her lips parted at the sight that welcomed her. The vampires\' imperial city was totally different from what she had imagined. It wasn\'t that creepy and lifeless place that she expected it to be. Lights were everywhere, the shadows of countless castles looming over certain sections of the city and the streetlights made it look so magical – as though she was looking at the imperial fairy city. How could a place that supposed to be hell-like end up looking so enchantingly picturesque!? </p><p> \"Do you like it?\" He asked and Evie couldn\'t even stop herself from nodding. \"That\'s great. But we better move on. We can roam around on our way back.\" </p><p> The next second, they were flying through the air again. Evie fought her instincts to shut her eyes and when she looked down while they were in mid-air, she was surprised at the thrill and excitement she felt. She wasn\'t scared anymore, and she actually found herself enjoying it. Oh my, she was flying! </p><p> She was so busy enjoying the incredible experience that she almost asked Gavriel why had he stopped. Thankfully, she heard him speak before she could ask and embarrass herself. \"We\'re here.\" He said as he put Evie down. </p><p> Evie turned and was speechless when she saw that they were already standing in front of a huge double door. This was obviously the palace\'s door. When she looked behind her, an even larger garden came into view. Oh my, just how big is this garden? </p><p> \"Let me help you with your cloak, wife.\" Gavriel, pulled her attention back to him and Evie could only stood still as Gavriel carefully pulled down the hood of her cloak. While he removed the cloak from her, he whispered in her ear. \"Are you ready?\" </p>'),(298,13,'Chapter 14 - Odd One',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> Exhilarating yet melodious Baroque-style music could be heard coming from the huge doors. It was apparent that there seemed to be a ball going on inside and that the event had long started. Did the vampire emperor throw a party to welcome her? Evie quickly shook her head and berated herself for the thought. There\'s no way they would do that. She was their enemy and Evie thought that everyone in this empire knew that. Even if this party was held because of her, she could only think of one reason. The emperor was probably planning to make her feel like she was wanted and welcomed in his empire and then make her drop her guard down. </p><p> \"Scared?\" that glorious voice yanked her from her deep thoughts and the moment Evie lifted her face, she stumbled back in surprise because he had bent so close Evie thought their faces would collide. He caught her waist with his strong arm. </p><p> Once Evie regained her balance, she took a step away from him. \"Please stop surprising me like that.\" She muttered under her breath. Gavriel tilted his head, acting as though he had not heard her. </p><p> \"My wife, we can go back if you\'re not ready yet,\" he said gently and Evie\'s eyes widened. W-what?! Was he really telling her this now? Why didn\'t he tell her this before he took her to this place? </p><p> Evie found herself tongue-tied. But she was more surprised at herself for actually not blurting out a big YES immediately so they could finally go back. She was very nervous and she knew she was never going to be prepared for this, so why was she hesitating? </p><p> After a long, motionless minute of indecision, Evie looked at the opened door. Her hands clenched under her cloak and reluctantly pointed out, \"But we\'re already here,\" she uttered without looking at him. She didn\'t see how the corner of his lips curved up slightly in pure amusement. </p><p> \"Right, the emperor must be getting so impatient now.\" He agreed and he moved in front of her. \"Let me help you take your cloak off, wife.\" </p><p> Evie dropped her gaze after she nodded, determined not to break the rule she had just set for herself. However, she was curious as to why the prince was the one doing all these menial tasks for her. He had obviously introduced and brought the butler along with them on this trip, so why wasn\'t he letting the butler do this job instead? </p><p> She valiantly fought against herself on the temptation of wanting to peek at him and to her delight, she managed not to look until he finally took the cloak off her. Though was it just her imagination that she felt like the process of just removing the cloak seemed way too slow? It must be, she thought. The thought of it being something else just frightened her that she shied away from it. </p><p> After giving Evie\'s cloak to Elias, Gavriel offered his hand to Evie. His gaze not leaving her face. The fiery dress she was wearing created a beautiful contrast with her long silver hair. He thought she was like an exotic red rose under the moonlight. </p><p> When they finally entered and walked through the huge door, Evie could do nothing but look around and appreciate the lavish luxury inside the imperial palace. The place was nothing like she had ever seen. She thought all palaces were almost exactly the same but this one had surpassed every palace she had ever seen. Just how rich were these vampires?! </p><p> Finally, they stopped a few steps before another huge door that appeared to be the entrance towards a massive ballroom. Evie looked at Gavriel, curious as to why they halted. </p><p> \"If anything troubles you or causes you to feel uncomfortable, don\'t hesitate to tell me.\" He whispered, causing Evie to blink. </p><p> She could only nod, biting the inside of her lower lip. When they stepped forward, the music became louder in her ears. The lights of the massive chandeliers were a feast to the eyes. Just as she imagined, the ballroom screamed of nothing but magnificence and elegance. It was a dream place. Ladies in beautiful gowns and sparkling jewels were moving so gracefully while the men moved so gallantly in tandem with their partners. Everything and everyone truly were a breathtaking sight to behold. </p><p> The party was lively, and the atmosphere wasn\'t heavy at all. She could see the vampires enjoying themselves – smiling, talking and dancing. At that moment, one thought came to Evie\'s mind. These vampires\' behaviours and actions truly were like humans. She surprised herself even as that thought arose in her mind. Had she ever thought what kind of life the vampires had aside from killing humans and drinking their blood? Never. Until now. Now that she thought about it and even witnessed it with her own eyes, she never would have thought they could even smile and laugh like her too. </p><p> As a strange emotion began to bloom inside her, she felt Gavriel\'s slight tug. \"Let\'s go.\" He said and Evie nodded. She took a deep breath as she subconsciously tightened her grip on his strong arm. </p><p> The vampires began to notice them and Evie felt as if more and more eyes were being trained on them as they proceeded further into the ballroom. The uplifting and gentle music continued playing and the couples on the dance floor didn\'t stop, so why did it feel like the atmosphere suddenly became heavy? Evie\'s expression slowly changed. She could only think about one thing that moment and the fact that she must be the reason why the atmosphere changed. She was the only outlier there – the only odd one out. The vampires didn\'t welcome her presence. But they knew she was coming, didn\'t they? The vampire emperor himself was the one who invited her. </p><p> An announcement acknowledging the presence of the second prince and his wife reached Evie\'s ears and she further tightened her grip on Gavriel\'s hand. </p><p> The slow march towards the emperor\'s throne was one of the most unnerving march Evie went through ever – perhaps only second to her own wedding march down the aisle! She wondered if Gavriel could hear the loud thumping of her heart against her chest. It seemed as if he did because he was already leaning closer to whisper to her. </p><p> \"Relax, wife. I am here.\" He said and Evie wondered how just his words could so easily made her heartbeat mellow out a little. </p><p> It felt as if that at long last, they were finally standing before the emperor. The moment Evie looked at the emperor, she was surprised. She had expected the vampire emperor to be someone so terrifying she would probably be covered in shivers all over her body just by standing before him. However, to her bewilderment, she felt none of that. Granted, the emperor was a big man, but she actually thought to herself after having a good look at him that he was not terrifying. </p><p> \"I am pleased that you came tonight, Lady Evielyn.\" His voice sounded like deep flowing waters over the riverbed – quite unexpected looking at his big build. </p><p> Flustered, Evie bowed and greeted him. \"The pleasure is all mine, Your Majesty.\" She managed to say it all out without stammering. And after a few exchanged of words of pleasantries, Gavriel led her to their designated seats. </p><p> Evie felt relieved but as soon as they were seated, she could still feel that the atmosphere remained somewhat slightly tense. She finally looked around and when her eyes caught Gavriel\'s men, her brows creased. Something was off. This was a ballroom, why were they all armed and even looking alert? </p><p> She looked at Gavriel, and she finally realized that the man never spoke to the emperor. Why can\'t she remember the emperor throwing even a single glance towards her husband ever since they approached him? Did Gavriel even greet His Royal Father? He didn\'t!! </p><p> That realization shocked Evie. She looked around again and she couldn\'t help but think that perhaps her presence was not the main reason contributing to the change in that weird atmosphere in the ballroom. She didn\'t know why, but she had a gut feeling that the culprit wasn\'t actually her but her vampire prince husband – Gavriel. But why? </p>'),(299,13,'Chapter 15 - Fiancée',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> As the music continued playing in the background, Evie distracted herself by looking around. A princess named Vera had approached her a while ago and just like the emperor, the woman was unexpectedly friendly to her. Though she hurriedly left right after greeting Gavriel in an obviously hasty manner. </p><p> Elias, who was standing behind Evie, told her that Vera was the only vampire princess of the empire. Evie found it surprising because back home, there were at least ten princesses in their empire. The difference was too huge! But maybe, there were more princes? </p><p> \"How about the princes? How many are there?\" Evie asked Elias. Even though Gavriel was sitting next to her, she preferred asking Elias. Apart from the fact that Elias was so easy to speak with, almost giving off the same vibe she got from both Fray and Gina, Evie also thought that this way, she could avoid getting close to Gavriel – especially avoiding those bewitching eyes of his. </p><p> \"There\'s only two, my lady.\" The butler said. \"The Crown Prince and His Highness Gavriel.\" </p><p> Evie\'s eyes widened. Really? Only two?! It seemed it was true that the vampires\' ability to reproduce offspring was indeed very low compared to humans. Now she somewhat has an understanding on why the vampires ended up agreeing with the truce. </p><p> Having her mind preoccupied with her own thoughts, she didn\'t see how Gavriel threw a threatening gaze towards the poor butler. Evie was blissfully unaware that the butler behind her had took a few steps away from her upon receiving the cold glare until she turned back to ask more questions. </p><p> \"Wife, how about we go and dance?\" Gavriel\'s voice was so compelling that before she knew it, she found herself turning to stare at him. </p><p> Evie\'s brain screamed at her to avert her gaze and thankfully she managed to look away before she lost herself in that seemingly hypnotic eyes. Dance? With him? No! She was trying so hard to keep her distance from him so why would she agree to dance with him? She only agreed to come to this ball because he didn\'t give her the chance to refuse. And she thought that this would be a great opportunity to understand this place and even meet the emperor so that when the time comes, she might be able to use the information she gathered over this trip to help the humans – once her father comes to rescue her and bring her back to where she belong. </p><p> \"I… I\'m sorry but I…\" she bit her lips as her shoulders tensed up. \"I\'m still –\" </p><p> \"It\'s fine if you\'re not ready yet.\" His pleasing voice yanked her eyes back to him and then, he smiled at her. It was a slow and gorgeous smile, Evie had to remind herself to breathe. My god! Was this man doing this on purpose? He\'s definitely seducing her, right?! </p><p> Quickly dropping her gaze before she loses control and end up gaping at him, Evie pressed her lips tight as she focused her attention to the couples on the dance floor. She did the right thing. She must do her best to refuse and maintain a distance from him. She must not dig her own grave by agreeing with everything he asks. </p><p> Gavriel fell silent after that and they both just sat there silently when a beautiful and voluptuous woman in a low-cut black gown approached them. The woman had long, and luxurious looking dark brown hair and her eyes were the colour of the forest. Evie could say, she was probably the most beautiful woman at the ball, even prettier than the blond-haired princess. </p><p> \"Good evening, Your Highness.\" She greeted and for the first time that night, someone greeted Gavriel with a genuine smile and not one that was forced and tensed up. Unlike the others, even the emperor and the princess, this woman stared directly into Gavriel\'s eyes. She behaved as if she knew him and were more than close acquaintances. Moreover, unlike the others who had greeted her warmly first before her husband, the woman had yet to spare her a glance. \"I was surprised that you actually attended a ball, Your Highness. And since it\'s very rare for you to attend this kind of occasion, will you dance with me?\" she offered her hand in front of Gavriel, causing Evie\'s eyes to momentarily widen. </p><p> Evie suddenly felt something inexplicable inside her and she failed to stop herself from staring at Gavriel with questions in her eyes. She regretted her impulse because as soon as she looked, Gavriel was also looking at her and just like her, he seemed to be asking as well. Though their questions were completely different, him probably asking for her permission and her asking him who the woman was. </p><p> She bit the inside of her lip. For some reason, her brain was lagging and while she was momentarily dumbfounded, Gavriel looked at the woman and spoke. \"This is my wife,\" Gavriel introduced and finally, the woman turned to face her. </p><p> \"Evielyn,\" Evie managed to say. </p><p> The woman blinked and then smiled at her. \"Nice to meet you, Lady Evielyn. I\'m Thea. I am His Highness\' fiancée.\" </p><p> Evie struggled to keep her serene expression. Fiancée? So that\'s why they were so casual with each other. Before Evie could even respond, Thea spoke again. \"I believe it won\'t be a problem with you if I dance with His Highness, right?\" she asked, and Evie didn\'t know why she had the sudden urge to clench her fists tight. </p><p> \"Of course not, Lady Thea.\" She said without throwing a glance at Gavriel. She didn\'t see how the man\'s face went a few shades darker at her approval. </p><p> Thea smiled and the next moment, Evie watched Gavriel\'s back as he followed Thea out to the dance floor. The couples that were dancing even cleared a wide space for them in the middle of the vast ballroom. </p><p> Evie felt a sharp pinch in her hands and realised she was clenching her fists tight. She not only averted her gaze from them but also turned around from looking at the sight. Something was wrong with her. Why did she suddenly feel so awful? She did the right thing. She rejected his offer to dance with her, so naturally she didn\'t have the right to keep him next to her when a fair woman wanted to dance with him. She was very well educated when dealing with these kinds of situations. Even in the human empire, any lady can ask a prince or an emperor to dance if they\'re brave and noble enough. It was something that was normal, and she assumed it would be the same in this land…was it not? If that woman was the prince\'s fiancée, she must be a noble lady. She had the right to ask Gavriel for a dance so why was she feeling this way? This wasn\'t right. </p><p> Evie gave her head a little shake and then took a silent deep breath. She scolded herself inside her head and somehow, she managed to feel a little better. But the moment her eyes caught them on the dance floor, swaying so gracefully, staring into each other\'s eyes, and looking so perfect as if they were a couple made in heaven, something strange and awful bloomed inside Evie\'s heart. </p><p> Despite her struggles, she couldn\'t seem to contain this undesirable feeling eating her. She tried to push it away, knowing that it was ridiculous for her to suddenly feel something like this but why is it so hard for her to control these overwhelming responses? Why? </p><p> \"Good evening, My Lady.\" A suave voice yanked her attention from the turmoil inside her. When she lifted her face, a tall and lean man was standing before her. He had intense sapphire blue eyes that seem to be able to pierce one\'s soul. His hair as blond and beautiful as the princess and the emperor. \"I think I must introduce myself first.\" His smile was pleasing and lovely. \"I\'m Caius, Gavriel\'s brother.\" </p><p> Evie almost choked in surprise but somehow, she managed to keep her reactions to herself and outwardly remain graceful. \"It\'s a pleasure to meet you, Crown Prince Caius. My name is –\" </p><p> \"Evielyn.\" He took the word out of her mouth with a smile before offering her his hand. \"May I have this dance, My Lady?\" </p><p> Evie didn\'t know what possessed her but before she could stop herself, she found herself accepting the crown prince\'s hand. She did that right after throwing a glance at Gavriel who couldn\'t seem to tear his eyes off the woman\'s face. </p><p> As she followed the crown prince to the dance floor, Evie\'s heart was thudding hard. Her mind was currently in chaos, debating with herself on just what the hell was she doing while the awful feeling still gripped her heart hard. She had rejected her husband and yet accepted the crown prince\'s offer? Just what was going on with her? </p><p> \"Are you nervous?\" The prince\'s deep voice nearly made her flinch. She finally realized his hand was already on her waist and that they were already dancing. </p><p> \"Uhm… a little, Your Highness.\" She said as she looked up at him, momentarily putting her predicament in the background. </p><p> \"Don\'t worry. I\'ve got you,\" he assured her. As Evie looked at him, she couldn\'t help but admire his good looks. He wasn\'t as otherworldly as Gavriel but he still had the appearance that could break many female hearts. But wait… wasn\'t he Gavriel\'s brother? Now that she looked closely at him, Evie realized that Gavriel had nothing in common with this man. Evie then realised that the emperor and the princess had the same sapphire blue eyes and same blond hair as this crown prince. Why is it that only Gavriel looked completely different from the three of them – these three whom he calls family? </p>'),(300,13,'Chapter 16 - Human',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> \"I hope Gavriel is treating you well, Lady Evielyn. I\'m afraid he wouldn\'t know how to be gentle to such a lady as yourself.\" The crown prince said in a low voice. Evie almost frowned but thankfully she managed to keep her face cool and collected. She was thinking perhaps the man wasn\'t saying these words to mock Gavriel as he seemed genuinely concerned about her. But why would he be worried in the first place? </p><p> \"His Highness Gavriel is treating me well. He\'s in fact…\" Evie remembered how gentle Gavriel had been to her ever since she met him at the altar on that night of their wedding. \"He\'s very gentle to me, Your Highness.\" </p><p> \"I see… that\'s a relief then. Nonetheless, I believe I must warn you, my lady. My brother might look harmless but he\'s a dangerous man. I want you to keep that in mind and never try to provoke him.\" </p><p> Evie could no longer keep her face straight. She didn\'t understand why this Prince was telling her something like this. Isn\'t this the first time they are meeting each other, much less speak to either party? She would\'ve slightly understood if he was trying to destroy Gavriel\'s image in her eyes but that did not seem to be his aim. What exactly was he aiming for by bringing these matters up? Was he trying to scare her? </p><p> \"I… I appreciate your concern, Your Highness but please don\'t worry… I am very aware that vampires are dangerous for a mere human like myself. I wouldn\'t dare provoke him or anyone in this land.\" Evie tried to respond as calm as she could. </p><p> The Prince\'s sapphire eyes seemed to have deepened in colour as he moved slightly closer. \"It seemed you still know nothing about your husband Lady Evielyn. I know he vowed never to harm you but there are times when my brother loses control of himself. If in any case, you feel something off about him…\" he paused and he looked as though he was scanning his surroundings before he continued. \"Stay away from him and don\'t ever dream of provoking him.\" </p><p> \"W-why are you telling me these?\" </p><p> \"Because I don\'t want a war suddenly breaking out if something happens to you.\" He calmly responded. Evie tried to look for any sign of lies in his striking blue eyes, but all his face was only showing that he truly was concerned for her well-being. \"My brother had been away for many years. He had just returned from a long… journey.\" Evie sensed as though he had just omitted something from his earlier sentence. \"We thought he\'s long dead, but he came back alive. Many things… changed in him since then. So, I am trying to warn you beforehand because I know my brother will not tell you about this.\" </p><p> \"You mean… about his journey and the changes in him?\" </p><p> \"Yes. He never talks about anything related to his journey. So as the crown prince and his older brother, I believe it\'s better for me to let you know about this. I believe this is important. For your sake, My Lady.\" </p><p> Evie blinked and all she could do was nod. \"I understand. I will keep that in mind, Your Highness.\" </p><p> He gave her a kind smile and Evie could only smile back to him. Curiosity had flooded her mind. She wanted to know more about Gavriel. </p><p> She turned her head to look for her husband and to her shocked surprise, those beautiful but piercing eye were trained on her. Evie subconsciously swallowed because for a moment, she thought he was angry. However, when the woman touched Gavriel\'s face to look at her, the awful feeling in her stomach that had momentarily disappeared returned – and this time, with a vengeance. </p><p> \"I never thought you\'re a possessive woman, Lady Evielyn.\" Prince Caius yanked her attention away from Gavriel. W-what? Her? Possessive? </p><p> Evie was speechless. She felt like her brain was having a hard time functioning. \"I… I…\" </p><p> \"I hope Gavriel had explained to you on the matter about Lady Thea.\" The crown prince ventured a guess and when Evie\'s expression sold her out that Gavriel had never mentioned anything, Caius sighed. \"You already know that vampires are no longer monogamous, right?\" he asked, and Evie nodded. She had heard about this before. At one point, a long time ago, vampires were one-woman creatures. However, since the war against the dragons started, the emperor at that time had changed the law, allowing the vampires to take more than one wife, for the sake of increasing their population. \"Of course, it is not a forced thing. Most vampires still have one wife even to these days but Gavriel\'s case is different so he must not sever his engagement to Lady Thea.\" </p><p> \"G-Gavriel\'s case?\" </p><p> \"He had been engaged to Lady Thea since they were young and you, My Lady, is a human…\" The prince paused as Evie looked at him with eyes filled with question. So, what if she was human? </p><p> Evie was about to ask again when the music ended – having them bow and curtsy to each other as was the custom. As they faced each other again, the crown prince smiled at her as Evie immediately whipped her head towards where Gavriel was standing. </p><p> When she saw his back as he held Thea\'s arm heading towards the balcony, Evie found herself being overwhelmed with intense new emotions. She didn\'t even realize that she was back in her seat until the crown prince spoke to her again. </p><p> \"It was nice talking to you, Lady Evielyn. If you have more questions, we can have a further discussion at the balcony, since it looks as if my brother is still occupied.\" The prince flashed her a friendly smile, but Evie could no longer fake her expression as her face fell. </p><p> She bowed in apology. \"Pardon me, Your Highness but I would like to retire for the night now. As you said, I\'m only a human so I need my rest. It was a pleasure talking to you.\" Evie did not know what was coming over her. Her chest felt tight and seemed to be hurting without actually feeling the pain. Weirdly enough, her eyes felt hot and were stinging something fierce. She moved unconsciously, not noticing how her feet hurried her along in her quest in needing to find a place where she could be alone and try to figure out this mess that is in her head. </p><p> Without giving the crown prince a chance to reply, she curtsied low and walked away in haste. The crown prince watched the beautiful human girl in red as three of Gavriel\'s men immediately followed after her. As soon as the lady in red was gone, the prince\'s sapphire blue eyes sharpened intensely before his gaze fell to the balcony where Gavriel had gone out from just a moment ago. </p>'),(301,13,'Chapter 17 - Whats Wrong',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> \"Let\'s end our engagement, Thea.\" Gavriel\'s tone was hard and firm. The atmosphere in the balcony abruptly turned incredibly chilly. Gavriel was berating himself for actually forgetting about this. He should\'ve dealt with Thea first before bringing his wife in the palace. But the matter of his prior engagement to Thea absolutely slipped his mind. It would be fair to even say it probably didn\'t weigh much in his mind in the first place. He should\'ve spoken to Thea as soon as he arrived in the capital while his wife was still asleep! </p><p> \"No.\" Thea didn\'t even hesitate. Her gaze on Gavriel was serious and unrelenting. Looking as though she would never give in no matter what Gavriel say or do to her. </p><p> Gavriel looked surprised at Thea\'s answer. It never crossed his mind that she would refuse. To the vampires, engagements were as serious as vows. Even if it was an engagement made by politics, it was something that wasn\'t easily severed. The engagement could only be legally severed if both parties are in mutual agreement to break it. If one of them refuse, no one could break the engagement. This was why Gavriel had hated his forced engagement to Thea. He knew that the emperor had arranged this engagement so he would be tied to something, since Thea\'s father was the emperor\'s loyal general. </p><p> Gavriel didn\'t hate Thea because it wasn\'t her fault and since they were young, Thea had never clung onto him like some desperate female. Before he left the empire, the two of them rarely see or even talk to each other. They had never even tried to form any romantic connections with each other before and that was why Gavriel even forget that he had a fiancée sometimes. He knew that the same was true with Thea. Even when they first met, they never enjoyed each other\'s company. And Thea had never tried approaching him before. She only started approaching him and talking to him when he returned just more than a month ago. So why was she refusing the annulment of their engagement now? </p><p> \"I am married now, Thea. I already have a wife.\" Gavriel stressed, his demeanor and expression were calm but the look in his eyes was intense. </p><p> \"I don\'t mind, Gavriel.\" </p><p> Her answer made Gavriel\'s eyes narrow. \"I mind. You know I will never have more than one wife.\" </p><p> \"I know.\" </p><p> \"Then why are you refusing? Did your father threaten you?\" </p><p> Thea played with her dark brown locks as she answered. \"No. My decision has nothing to do with father or anyone else. This is my own decision.\" </p><p> Gavriel\'s jaws tightened. \"Then what exactly do you want to happen for still refusing like this?\" </p><p> There have been many cases of vampire engagements where one party refuses to end the engagement. But because of the vampire\'s law allowing polygamy, the man can always marry someone else even if he was still engaged to another girl. Thus, most of the females who refused to sever the engagement gave up in the end while some just let it until they got married to someone else. </p><p> \"She\'s a human, Your Highness. If she\'s a vampire, I\'d give you up right here, right now. But she\'s a human.\" </p><p> \"What exactly are you trying to say? So what if she\'s human?\" Gavriel didn\'t know why but he was ticked off. He wasn\'t usually like this. He had dealt with so many sensitive and political issues before and nothing could make him lose his cool. So why was he suddenly pissed that Thea was pointing out that his wife was just a human? </p><p> \"Your Highness, I\'m certain you know what I\'m trying to –\" </p><p> \"Just say it, Thea.\" </p><p> Thea was surprised. Was he testing her? She knew just how intelligent this man was. This prince wasn\'t someone who needs explanations about obvious things such as this. And why does he sound irked and angry? Was he so pissed and angry his emotions were getting the better of him? Thea silently gnashed her teeth. She knew what kind of man this prince was. In fact, she had never seen him so emotional and worked up like this before. He was always calm and collected even in battles and even in front of the emperor so why was he acting like some short-tempered and dumb now? There was just no way he didn\'t understand what she had meant! But fine, if he wanted her to spell it out for him, then she\'d be happy to say it. </p><p> \"She\'s a human so she can only be your wife for the next few decades, Gavriel. When she –\" </p><p> \"Enough.\" He cut her off and Thea was once again surprised at the intensity of his voice. </p><p> \"I can wait for you so there\'s no need to end our engagement. A few decades isn\'t that long –\" </p><p> \"I said, enough.\" His voice wasn\'t loud but the harshness and coldness in them skyrocketed. Even his calm demeanor was gone Thea\'s lips parted in shock because of the darkness he had emitted just to make her shut her mouth. Why? Why was this man acting like this now? Her relationship with Gavriel was no different with that human girl. That human was married off to him because of mere politics too. So why was he reacting like he hated the fact that she pointed out blunt facts? </p><p> Thea felt her blood boiling, unaware that her eyes were turning red. \"No matter what you say, I will never let our engagement end. I told you, I don\'t mind waiting for you. And besides, it didn\'t seem like your wife mind it at all, Your Highness.\" </p><p> As though something had snapped inside him, Gavriel froze for a moment. His reaction didn\'t escape Thea\'s eyes and she smirked inwardly. \"I could tell she\'s fine with it. From what I observed she might not even care if you take another wife. Now I can\'t help but wonder… does she even like you at all, Your Highness? She must be seeing you as nothing but a monster like all humans th –\" </p><p> \"Thea.\" </p><p> With just that one word, Thea clamped her mouth tight. The chill that enveloped her body forced her to subconsciously flinch back. No one ever uttered her name that way before. That voice was filled with dangerous warnings that sounded so much like death that came knocking early on her door, terrified her more than the emperor\'s or her father\'s raging voice. W-when did this man change so much? When did he become this scary? </p><p> He stepped closer to her and leaned over. His killing aura was barely kept veiled and eyes dangerously cold, as if something sucked up all the light in his pair of beautiful moon-kissed eyes. \"Listen, and listen very carefully,\" he whispered. \"Evie\'s going to be my one and on-\" </p><p> Before Gavriel could even finish his sentence, Samuel emerged from the door. As soon as Gavriel met Samuel\'s eyes and received the report that his wife had left the ballroom, he leaped from the veranda and his three men followed behind him, not even throwing a glance at the woman he had left behind. </p><p> While he was in the air, he spotted his beautiful rose under the moonlight rushing down the staircase as if she was trying to run all the way across the vast garden, right up to the palace\'s gate. </p><p> He landed right in front of her, causing Evie to gasp. \"Wife,\" he said as he approached her. \"You want to go home now? Come, I\'ll carry you –\" </p><p> \"No!\" Evie\'s exclamation was sharp against the silence of the night and Gavriel\'s low baritone. Her voice even cracked as she stretched out her hands to stop him from touching her. </p><p> \"What\'s wrong? Are you alright? Did something happen?\" he asked worriedly, but Evie gritted her teeth and pushed his outreached hands away. </p><p> \"Nothing\'s wrong! Nothing happened! You just go back to your fiancée now. Elias can bring me home!\" she yelled at him as she kept pushing his reaching hands and was actively avoiding his touch like the plague. </p><p> Gavriel caught her wrists and made her look at him. He was no fool as he heard and observed how her voice trembled and sounded strained as she said the word \'your fiancée\' and considering how frantic and distressed her movements were. His eyes smoldering and filled with wonder as he looked at her. \"Wife, are you jealous?\" he tilted his head slightly as he asked and Evie turned to a frozen statue. Oh my! W-what was she doing?! What was she doing?!! This can\'t be… she can\'t be acting like this! No! No! This can\'t be happening! </p>'),(302,13,'Chapter 18 - Grave Mistake',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> The silence that followed Gavriel\'s question was deafening as Evie was utterly tongue-tied. Her lips trembling a little as she could only look at him with wide eyes. No matter how much she tried, she could not deny the shocking and foreign emotions that had flooded her insides since she saw him dancing with Thea. The question had struck her damned hard. </p><p> \"No! J-jealous?! W-why would I be jealous?!\" She stammered as she took a step back, shaking her head forcefully as if to also convince herself of that statement, as she dropped her eyes to the ground, avoiding Gavriel\'s eyes. </p><p> Gavriel watched her carefully and something gleamed in his eyes. His thin lips slightly twitching as if he was suppressing a smile. In the end, he caught his lower lip between his perfect white teeth and silently looked elsewhere to get his bearing. </p><p> When he returned his gaze to her, his expression was serious but gentle. He took a step closer, but Evie stepped back, causing him to sigh. </p><p> \"Look at me, wife.\" His voice was compelling and warm. Yet Evie turned away, showing him her blatant defiance. \"If you\'re not jealous, then why are you reacting like this?\" </p><p> Evie\'s grip on her skirt tightened and she felt her body about to tremble. \"I said, I\'m not! I just want to leave this place, now!\" she yelled at him, unaware that she was looking as though she was about to cry. </p><p> Gavriel stilled and became silent. His gaze never leaving her face. After another moment of observing her distraught face, his low and husky voice filled the silence. \"Okay, I understood. I\'ll take you home, now.\" </p><p> He offered her his hand and Evie\'s gaze settled on it. Why does he always do this? Why did he always offer her his hand like this? She had just yelled at him and yet he\'s still… </p><p> Evie knew that every time she accepts this large, warm and strong hand, she was letting him come a step closer to her. And if she was honest to herself – a step closer towards her heart too. Since their eyes first met that night of their wedding, Evie had been running on adrenaline and emotions that had been centred on this man before her. She couldn\'t believe that it\'s only been a few days and she was already this overwhelmed. Evie was starting to feel scared and worried because she was not a fool not to understand the reasons behind her very own actions and emotions. At this rate, if she let him come any closer than this, she was terrified of the consequences. It would be unimaginable! </p><p> Tightening her grip on her skirt even harder, Evie steeled herself. Her gaze still not landing on his person even once. </p><p> \"I want Elias to take me back. Please go back inside, the ball is not over yet. I\'ll be fine on my own,\" Evie said decisively. Her voice now softer but firmer with solid determination as her gaze skittered around everywhere but on his face. </p><p> Evie waited for him to retract his hand and when he didn\'t, she began to feel a little anxious. Was her refusal still not enough? As she was struggling to think about her next move, Gavriel spoke. </p><p> \"I\'m afraid your request came a little too late now, wife. Everyone already left just a while ago.\" </p><p> His words made Evie whipped around just to see that the men behind her were gone. Her lips parted in disbelief and then, she found herself turning to stare at him. He was rubbing the back of his neck as he looked at her with an apologetic gaze, causing Evie to fall even more speechless. </p><p> Evie didn\'t know that while she was refusing to look into Gavriel\'s eyes, the man had been ordering his men to disappear and leave before him despite their strong refusal. Gavriel had somehow foreseen that his wife would try to distance herself from him again and he was glad he had seen that coming. </p><p> \"Now let\'s go. Before the emperor sends someone to call us back inside.\" He reached for her hand and without giving her a moment to protest, he lifted Evie, princess-like, and leapt from the ground. </p><p> All Evie could do was wrap her arms around his neck and as her forehead brushed against his jaw, she felt like he had smiled. He pulled her head back to look at his face. \"Did you… just smile?\" she asked, her expression still serious. </p><p> Gavriel craned his head a little. \"Am I not allowed to smile too? Wife?\" </p><p> Evie blinked. \"T-that\'s not what I meant…\" she stammered in surprise. \"And what do you mean by \'too\'?\" </p><p> \"Well, I figured I am not allowed to accept anyone\'s offer to dance with me because it will make my wife angry.\" </p><p> His words made Evie looked like a blow had struck her, hard. While she was tongue-tied, Gavriel continued. </p><p> \"If smiling will make you angry as well, then I shall not –\" </p><p> \"D-don\'t be ridiculous. Why would you smiling make me angry?\" she blurted and then the sly prince turned his smile on. That smile that was enough to turn any woman\'s brain to mush and make her voluntarily crawl into his bed. </p><p> When Evie saw that smile, she didn\'t know why but she felt like she had just made one of the greatest mistakes in her life. </p><p> \"If my smile won\'t make you angry, then I think I should smile more –\" </p><p> \"No!\" </p><p> \"No?\" </p><p> \"I… I mean… don\'t smile when there\'s no reason. Else… you\'ll look like a fool.\" </p><p> He chuckled and Evie felt like she just brainlessly committed another grave mistake. She must get away from this dangerous man. She couldn\'t believe that even his laughter could gravely affect her. </p>'),(303,13,'Chapter 19 - Non-related',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> \"Of course.\" His eyes gleamed with pure amusement as he landed on the roof top of a certain castle. Evie waited for him to leap again and when he didn\'t move, she lifted her face to look at him. She regretted immediately because his eyes held hers in an intense but still somehow sad gaze now. \"You\'re not angry with me, anymore?\" he asked. </p><p> When Evie couldn\'t find her voice, he looked at her while patiently awaiting her response. And then he sat on top of the watchtower\'s edge, with her in his lap. </p><p> \"Still angry?\" he whispered again after a long while of silence, causing Evie to swallow. She managed to pull her eyes off him and when she looked down, wonder filled her eyes. She felt like she had been transported to a different world. She had never once thought or imagined that a night could be this alive and vivacious. </p><p> \'So, this is how the world looks like when everyone doesn\'t sleep and rest at night.\' She thought to herself. Because this vampire\'s capital had so many bigger castles compared to any human cities she had ever seen, the lights from the castles and the big houses and the streets spread throughout the land as far as she could see. </p><p> The view was so different and breath-taking, but it still wasn\'t enough to distract her from the man holding her. </p><p> \"W-why did we stop?\" she asked instead. </p><p> \"Because it\'s not good if we reached home while you\'re still angry with me.\" </p><p> Evie blinked at him again as she creased her brows. \"Was that… vampires\' belief?\" </p><p> \"Well…\" Gavriel tilted his head slightly. \"Yes. It\'s our castle\'s long tradition that a husband shouldn\'t bring an angry wife home, and vice versa. They said that\'s a bad luck that could ruin the household.\" </p><p> \"What? Vampires believe in bad luck?!!\" Evie\'s eyes were wide in disbelief. </p><p> When he chuckled again, Evie puffed her cheeks. \"You\'re tricking me, aren\'t you?\" </p><p> \"No. I am trying to soothe your anger.\" </p><p> Evie could no longer keep her expression in check, and she buried her face in her palms to hide her expression. What should she do? Was she really doomed now? Oh please, Evie… hold your ground! </p><p> \"I… I am not angry with you anymore.\" She uttered in a small voice. </p><p> \"Really?\" his voice sounded worried, but she nodded frantically. All she wanted now was for them to go back so she could escape from his clutches. If they were to stay here any longer than this… </p><p> \"Yes. So, let\'s go home now, Gavriel. Please.\" Her voice was so weak it was barely a whisper. </p><p> Gavriel silently stared at her as she continued hiding her face in her hands. He lifted his hand and was about to touch her hair that was being blown about by the breeze, but he stopped. He retracted his hand and finally, he stood. </p><p> Without a word he leapt, and it didn\'t take long for them to reach Gavriel\'s castle. As soon as Gavriel put Evie down, Evie curtsied to her husband and wished him goodnight before immediately running towards the grand staircase without turning back. </p><p> As soon as Evie\'s back disappeared from his view, Gavriel ran his fingers through his raven black hair. \"Elias.\" He called out as his silver-grey eyes sharpened. </p><p> \"Yes, Your Highness.\" Elias appeared before him. </p><p> \"I need you to investigate Lady Thea\'s motive on refusing to break our engagement. I need results as soon as possible.\" </p><p> Though Elias looked surprised, he didn\'t dare ask further questions. \"Yes, Your highness.\" </p><p> Once Elias was gone, another man appeared before Gavriel. It was Zolan. The most intelligent of his men. \"What is it?\" </p><p> \"The emperor has started his move, Your Highness.\" </p><p> Gavriel smiled. But it was a smile way far from the kind of smile he had showed to Evie. His smile that moment was sinister and screaming with dark and wicked amusement. \"Gather everyone in the hall.\" He ordered and Zolan gave a curt nod. </p><p> ... </p><p> As soon as Evie rushed in, she closed the doors to their chambers. She then rested her arms against the wall and leaned her forehead there, feeling totally drained emotionally. Her mind and heart were in chaos; the kind of chaos she didn\'t know how to deal with. She wasn\'t prepared for something like this. God knows how she had worked so hard for many days to learn everything that was related to vampires, their customs, habits and whatever she could get her hands on, all just to help her survive in the vampire\'s land. She had even trained herself on how to deal with her fears and how to react if it overtakes her. A general even made her memorize the exact words she should say if and when any vampires threaten or blackmail her to divulge information about the dragon keeper, her father. It was these kinds of extreme matters which had been the main content of her brain for days before her wedding. </p><p> Never in a million years would she have even imagined that there would come a time that she had to deal with something completely different and non-related. She never thought she would end up having to deal with herself first, more specifically the matters of her own heart, that had already started rebelling against herself. What should she do? </p>'),(304,13,'Chapter 20 - Rumour',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> Evie didn\'t realize that she had been keeping that position for quite long while until a knock pulled her attention back to the present. </p><p> Fray and Gina emerged from the door with wide smiles as they greeted her. </p><p> \"Good evening, Milady. We came to help you get changed,\" said Fray and Evie tried her best to maintain as normal a smile at them both. </p><p> The maids then hovered around her while Evie silently let them do their job. Her mind was still wandering, but her brows occasionally pulled together, as though a certain thought kept popping in her head to disturb the flow of her mind. </p><p> \"Milady, would you want to go somewhere after your rest?\" Gina asked politely and Evie almost frowned because she knew it was already past midnight. Thankfully, she managed to stop herself in time as she quickly realized that she was in a different world now. The opposite to the world she came from – a world where people moved around during the bright daylight and enjoy their rest when it was dark. Was she going to live like the vampires now? Was she going to stay awake during the night and sleep during the day? </p><p> As Evie looked to the pitch-black darkness outside her window, her thoughts flew back to the bright and sunny Southern Empire, her home. She was in a place that was far, far away from that familiar and comforting scene now and that realization that slammed into her heart made her feel an overpowering sense of homesickness within her. </p><p> \"If it would please you, milady, it is be our pleasure to bring you to the garden.\" Gina\'s voice was careful and gentle. Evie could tell that the maids must have felt the roller-coaster of her emotions because she was too caught up in her reminiscing that she forgot to hide it. </p><p> Clearing her throat, Evie centred and composed herself. She knew she couldn\'t sleep even if she forced herself because she had slept for so long. But she also could not bring herself to agree with them. Why would she go out at night? She was not a vampire. </p><p> Suddenly, words from her advisors back home echoed in her head and as though something enlightened her, Evie shook her head at her maids. \"It\'s okay, I\'m fine. I am not used to moving about in the darkness so I doubt I can enjoy the view of the garden much when it\'s dark. I will try to sleep tonight so I can visit the garden in the morning.\" </p><p> One of her advisors told her that she must continue living the way she usually does. If she sleeps when the vampires were active, she could avoid them. Evie thought this was the best way she could avoid her husband. And since he wanted them to sleep in the same bed, this would solve her dilemma on how she could avoid him. </p><p> Evie took a deep breath into her lungs, strengthening herself while Fray and Gina glanced at each other with worried looks in their eyes. </p><p> \"We understand, milady. We will also go to bed soon, so we\'ll be awake in the morning.\" </p><p> \"Yes.\" Evie nodded as they again changed her clothes into a sleeping gown. </p><p> \"How\'s the ball, Milady? I hope you enjoyed it.\" Gina asked innocently and Evie was then again reminded of all the emotional roller coaster that overshadowed the luxurious event. She gave her head a little shake to force the emotions that bubbled inside her again. </p><p> \"The palace is really very grand, and the emperor seemed kind. The crown prince is also surprisingly quite friendly.\" Evie commented and she was surprised at the momentary shock on Fray and Gina\'s face. </p><p> \"We are happy to know that they treated you well, milady.\" </p><p> Evie was suspicious at their reaction. For some reason, Evie thought that her maids reacted the same way how the vampires inside the grand hall reacted when she and Gavriel arrived in the palace. Now that she thought about it, the question she\'d been wandering about when she was dancing with the crown prince came to her mind. </p><p> \"I noticed…\" she started hesitantly. \"Gav… my husband seemed to be on bad terms with the emperor and his brother and sister. It might just be my imagination though…\" she let her statement trail off. </p><p> Carefully watching her maids\' expressions, Evie saw them glanced at each other. Her curiosity then got the better of her and she sat up straight and faced them, giving them the most piercing and probing look she could summon. </p><p> \"Uhm…\" Fray nudged Gina when they realized Evie pinning them with her very obviously questioning gaze. After a long stretch of awkward silence, Fray was the one who relented and spoke up. \"Your observation is not misplaced, milady. Everyone knows that His Highness Gavriel is not on good terms with his royal family.\" </p><p> \"Why? Is it because Gavriel has a different mother?\" Evie asked. She recalled her observations on how Gavriel\'s appearance and colouring was so very different from the rest of the royal family. No matter how one changed angles or views, Gavriel does not resemble the emperor or his siblings at all. </p><p> There was another round of silence. Evie could tell that the maids were having a bloody battle against themselves whether they should speak or not. </p><p> When Evie realized their struggle, she waved her hand, signalling them to stop but she didn\'t hide her disappointment. \"It\'s okay, I understand. I shall go to bed now.\" She said in a sullen voice and guilt flashed in the maids\' eyes. </p><p> As Evie sat at the edge of the bed, Gina suddenly approached Evie and she dropped to her knees as she looked up at Evie. \"We will tell you what we know but this needs to be kept a secret between us, okay? Milady?\" The maid whispered as she glanced at the door. </p><p> Fray was already standing by the door as if guarding it. Evie blinked. She realized that the information they\'re going to tell her must be something confidential. She knew the risk. These two maids might be punished severely if it was found out that they gave the secret away, but her curiosity was so strong she couldn\'t refuse to hear it. </p><p> \"Of course, Gina. This will only between the three of us.\" Evie replied sincerely and Gina nodded. Her gaze became incredibly serious as she continued whispering to Evie. </p><p> \"It is said that all vampire royal family in the past since the beginning of time has that distinct feature of having raven black hair and their eyes are the colour of the cold grey moon.\" Said Gina and Evie immediately frown. The emperor, the crown prince and the princess all had a sapphire blue eyes and blond hair. Now that Evie thought about it, she had yet to see a vampire with raven black hair and moon-like grey eyes except Gavriel. Even within the crowd of vampires who were at the imperial palace, she never saw anyone with black hair except her husband. </p><p> With a shocked expression, Evie looked at Gina in confusion. The maid continued after seeing her reaction. \"There\'s a rumour that the current emperor is not the real vampire royalty and that includes the crown prince and the princess as well. Rumour has it too, that the real and only royal bloodline still alive right now is our very own prince Gavriel, milady. Your husband.\" </p>'),(305,13,'Chapter 21 - Bullseye',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> Evie forced herself to go to bed after the maids left her. But no matter how hard she tried; she just couldn\'t calm down sufficiently to drift off to sleep. Her mind was occupied with a lot of things, mainly, about Gavriel. She didn\'t want to think about him, but it was impossible for her to ignore what she had just managed to glean from her maids. It was just a rumor she repeated to herself, but according to all the things she had observed in the imperial palace – the royal family\'s reaction towards him including all the vampires present in the ball, all told her otherwise. Moreover, appearances do not lie! The difference was pretty obvious and having Gavriel being the only one with such distinct appearance says it all. </p><p> Burying her face into her pillow, Evie let out a deep sigh. She never would have thought something like this was going on in the vampire\'s empire. Back home, the human\'s main and biggest problem was nothing else but vampires and there were no major issues among the royals. Of course, the royal bloodline was always at an utmost importance but there were just too many princes and princesses it was unthinkable for anyone to worry about the possibility of the royal bloodline ending. </p><p> Thinking about this made Evie realize that perhaps, this was one of the reasons why the vampires agreed with the ridiculous truce the humans had offered. Who would have thought that they were actually hiding a bigger problem within their midst? She couldn\'t help but feel a little anxious because she knew that a battle between Gavriel and the royal family could just be triggered anytime soon. Could her husband have a chance against them? Would everything be alright? </p><p> Squeezing her eyes tightly, Evie\'s forehead creased even more. She realized the irony in where she was almost similar to Gavriel. Only that she was not born male. She was the only child of the Dragon keeper. If her mother could not produce a son, the Ylvia\'s bloodline would… </p><p> Evie\'s eyes opened wide, shocked at her own thoughts. How could she even bear to think of such a terrifying thing? Her mother would give birth again to a healthy son very soon! She screamed to herself as she shook her head because if that happens, Evie knew that humanity\'s only hope would crumble to pieces and they would forever remain in the mercies of the vampires. </p><p> … </p><p> The sun was already shining bright when Evie woke up. She immediately looked to her side, expecting to see her husband lying there, asleep beside her. But when she saw that side of his bed empty and cold, Evie felt something inexplicable. She looked outside the window and the sun was already high. It\'s supposed to be late for the vampires already, right? So why was he not back in their room yet? </p><p> Suddenly, the image of Gavriel dancing gracefully with Lady Thea flashed in her mind and her fingers clenched the bed covers tightly. When she realized her reaction, Evie buried her face into her cupped palms. Why? What was going on with her? She should\'ve been happy that he wasn\'t there... She should\'ve been glad if he went and slept with someone else… Her plan was to have him ignore her as if she didn\'t exist so why was she feeling this way? </p><p> Evie\'s mood was dark and gloomy for the rest of that day. Her maids brought her out to view and enjoy the garden and showed her around the vast and breathtaking castle. She tried her best to feel better but no matter how much she smiled, it never quite reached her eyes and the emotion on her face never truly came from her heart. </p><p> \"My lady, are you sure you\'re alright? Are you feeling unwell or perhaps you are homesick?\" Fray asked tentatively as they sat on one of the benches in the middle of the sprawling and beautiful garden. </p><p> \"I…\" Evie could not answer immediately. \"Yes. I miss my mother,\" she said. She did miss her family, her home, and her life back home, but she couldn\'t fool herself and deny that her homesickness was in fact overshadowed by something else – something unwelcomed yet incredibly strong. </p><p> The maids looked worried. \"Do you have something you want to do, My lady? I mean, do you have a hobby you loved doing…while back home?\" </p><p> Seeing how much the maids were trying to cheer her up since morning, Evie sighed and then smiled. \"Hmm… my hobby…\" a small spark glimmered in her eyes and she stood. \"Do you think you can find me a bow and a quiver of arrows?\" </p><p> Fray and Gina looked at each other and then looked at her with wide eyes. \"Arrows?!\" </p><p> \"Yes. My father used to teach me archery when I was young and I\'d say I fell in love with it.\" For the first time that day, the maids saw a real spark in her eyes and it hyped them up. </p><p> \"Stay with Her Highness, Fray. I shall go and bring a fine bow and some arrows. I\'ll be quick!\" Gina said as she ran off with her task. </p><p> When the energetic red-haired maid returned, Elias was with her. The butler that Evie haven\'t seen since the night he was introduced up till now looked worried as he approached her, holding a fine bow in his hand. </p><p> \"My Lady, you… you asked for a bow and arrows?\" he asked. </p><p> \"Yes.\" Evie didn\'t waste a moment and stretched out her hand to take the bow from the butler. </p><p> Elias swallowed as he hesitantly and carefully handed the bow over to her. He was not sure if this was the wisest past time activity the Lady should be doing. \"Uhm… my lady, isn\'t it dangerous for you to…\" </p><p> Evie smiled at him and Elias froze. \"Don\'t worry. I think I should be competent enough in this.\" She took the bow from his hand, even tugging it when Elias held onto it and refused to let go. </p><p> \"Please prepare something for me to practice with.\" She told the butler and Elias nodded at the maids. \"This bow is amazing. My bow back home is heavier than this.\" She examined the bow with awe flashing through her eyes. </p><p> And then, she stretched her hand towards Elias again, asking for the arrows. </p><p> The expression on Elias became even more worried and anxious as he gave her an arrow. \"Please be careful My Lady. I can\'t let you get hurt.\" </p><p> \"Geez. You\'re being such a worrywart Elias. I said I\'m fine.\" she gently yanked the arrow from the poor butler again. \"No one\'s going to get hurt. It\'s not like you\'re sending me to a battlefield or something.\" </p><p> Once the maids had set up a shooting range for Evie, she positioned herself. </p><p> She took a deep breath before lifting her bow and pulling it taut, to eye level. Evie could tell that Elias and her maids were anxious like cats on a hot tin roof. She could even sense Elias\' alertness. He had his eyes turn red as he was more than prepared to come to her rescue any second. </p><p> Evie steadied her hand on the bow and focused her aim on her target. She realized the bow – though lighter than her bow back home – and the way it was strung seemed tighter. </p><p> When she finally released the shot, she ended up missing her target by a fair bit. The maids clapped looking very excited and happy for her. Even Elias looked like he was impressed. </p><p> Ignoring them, Evie focused on her target and shot again and again, getting used to the feel and pull of the arrow. As she took shot after shot, her emotions were starting to boil inside her. Her family\'s faces began to appear in her mind. She missed them. Were they missing her too? Were they worried about her? Were they also thinking about her now? </p><p> Evie sighed and when she looked at her target, she smiled bitterly when she saw that she didn\'t even manage to land a single bullseye. But she couldn\'t stop yet because she knew that doing this was better than her going back into the room that she and Gavriel shared and end up sulking there. </p><p> However, as she silently aimed, she heard faint sounds coming from her maids. When Elias spoke, Evie didn\'t know why but the first thing she heard was Thea\'s name, and then… he mentioned her husband\'s. </p><p> Suddenly, Evie got furious. Her grip on the arrow tightened and something hot and tight seemed to be blocking her throat. Thea? So he wasn\'t home because he was with his fiancée?! </p><p> The next series of Evie\'s shot all flew true and fierce as they pierced the bullseye, that Elias and the maids had their mouths gaping open in shock. They couldn\'t even react immediately and just stood there staring in disbelief – between their \'delicate\' Lady and the target. </p><p> No one spoke even when Evie\'s hand dropped, and her breathing was a little more ragged than earlier. Someone then started clapping from behind her and when she heard the voice that followed, her body stiffened. </p>'),(306,13,'Chapter 22 - Predator',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> \"Never would I have thought that my wife is such an excellent archer.\" Gavriel\'s proud and gentle voice echoed, but Evie didn\'t move to even glance at him. She simply stood there, tensed, as her heart suddenly began to thud fast inside her rib cage. </p><p> She could hear the maids and Elias greeting him. She knew that courtesy required her to offer him her greetings too. But Evie was utterly overwhelmed with the emotions that were surging tempestuously inside of her – the anger, the homesickness and the… unwanted feelings that blazed even stronger in his presence. Why? Why was she feeling like this? What did he do to her that his mere presence could shake her to her core? </p><p> Slowly, Evie steeled herself and when she turned towards him, he smiled at her. She stiffened at the sight of that heartbreaking smile that haunted her since last night and then the whole day too. </p><p> Rigid, Evie didn\'t move nor said anything. She couldn\'t. But when he took a step towards her, she took a step back automatically even before she realized she had done so. </p><p> The prince\'s brows creased slightly, and his smile faded at her reaction. However, he still continued stepping closer to her. This time, she managed to root her feet to the ground and stood firm. Uncontrollably, her heart hammered even faster inside her, and she found herself growing more nervous. Her body just kept reacting in a way that she neither recognised nor like. </p><p> But he stopped just three steps short of reaching her as if he had sensed someone\'s presence. Levy landed behind him, causing him to turn away from Evie. </p><p> \"What is it?\" he asked in a quiet tone, returning his gaze back to Evie again. </p><p> \"Your Highness, General Alcan and his daughter are here.\" Levy said and Gavriel seemed a little surprised. </p><p> It was silent for a moment, but Evie felt like a secret conversation was going on between the men that the rest of them are not privy to. </p><p> When Gavriel faced her again, he looked at her practice target. \"I think you\'ve played enough, wife. You should have a rest now. I\'ll see you again at dinner.\" </p><p> After saying those, Gavriel immediately left. A general visiting the prince\'s castle at this hour… if they were humans, this hour was considered near dawn. That General Alcan must be a very important guest to cause Gavriel to leave in such a haste, she thought. </p><p> Letting out a sigh, Evie silently faced her target again. She was so nervous when he was here but when he left, she almost called out and said \'wait\'. Gripping her bow, Evie picked up another arrow and then took a stabling deep breath. </p><p> \"Is…\" she started. \"Is General Alcan an important ally of His highness?\" she asked and the maids\' silence made Evie stop her shot and glanced at them over her shoulder. </p><p> \"No milady. The truth is…\" Fray paused hesitantly. \"General Alcan is known to be the emperor\'s most loyal subordinate. He\'s Lady Thea\'s father.\" </p><p> Evie\'s eyes widened and quickly, she hid her face from them. Again, she felt her pulse beating at a furious tempo just like before Gavriel arrived. Only this time, it was far graver. She was glad she wasn\'t facing them because she could no longer keep her face serene. </p><p> \"Sir Levy said he\'s with his daughter. He only has one daughter and that\'s lady Thea, right?\" Fray said to Gina in a soft voice. </p><p> \"Oh no, could it be that he\'s here to insist on His Highness marrying his daughter?\" Gina replied. </p><p> \"But the general is loyal to the emperor –\" </p><p> \"What if the general swear his loyalty to prince Gavriel now once His Highness marries his daughter?\" </p><p> \"Oh my, now that you mention it… that is possible, His Highness really needs an ally after all –\" </p><p> Suddenly, the maids gasped as they looked at Evie. Their faces were apologetic and worried. They tend to gossip like this all the time before their lady arrived that they had forgotten their lady was with them and could hear them discussing it clearly. </p><p> \"Uhm… my lady… that –\" </p><p> \"Fray, Gina…\" she cut her maid off. \"I\'d like to go into that little forest. I could hear birds singing from there, I think I can hunt one with this bow.\" Evie\'s voice was unusually calm. </p><p> The maids looked at each other. </p><p> \"I\'ll shoot one first before I return to my chambers,\" she continued as she picked the arrows and then, squaring her shoulders, she walked off and headed to the nearby small forest inside the castle\'s premises that she mentioned about previously. </p><p> \"You two please wait here. I don\'t want the birds to be startled by so many people and end up running away so don\'t follow me. I\'ll be back as soon as I catch one.\" Evie\'s voice was light and seemingly cheery. However, Fray and Gina didn\'t know why but they felt her expressions were odd. </p><p> Fray and Gina looked at each other again but they eventually bowed obediently to her as they watched Evie enter the forest. They were a little hesitant at first but seeing that she seemed to be alright, they sat on the grass and waited. </p><p> As soon as Evie was inside the forest, she hid behind a tree trunk and leaned her back against the tree. She couldn\'t believe her reaction just a while ago upon hearing what the maids were saying. She felt like she had been shot by a stray arrow right through the heart and her throat constricted to the point it physically hurt, and she had had to silently release her breath in a controlled flow, to hide her emotions from the maids. </p><p> How could she? How was it possible for her to feel this way? Their marriage was never a love match. She didn\'t even spend much time with him yet. It has only been a few days since their wedding! </p><p> Evie buried her face into her palms. The feelings she had felt that moment frightened her and at the same time, invigorated her. The worse thing was she didn\'t know how to handle such strong emotions she had never felt before. </p><p> She leaned the back of her head against the tree and kept her eyes closed and regulated her breathing to calm her chaotic mind. Her fists at her sides were clenched so tightly as she wished desperately for absolute strength to mightily shut her own stupid, mindless and rebellious heart. </p><p> When her breathing became even, Evie filled her mind with the faces of the terrifying vampires she had met before. She relived that time when the vampires attacked her carriage and she saw those dead bodies of their own soldiers, mutilated and torn apart. And then she pulled out that one memory in time when she witnessed their soldiers coming back home tattered and bloodied because they had lost the war against the vampires. She remembered how she felt that day when she saw just how many of the lively and confident soldiers who had left before then came back marching home like walking dead. That time, Evie had asked her mother how they could stop this from happening again and she had been told that the only way to stop such tragedy was to annihilate the vampires. </p><p> Evie flinched at the thought of annihilation and all of a sudden, the faces of the vampires in this place that she had seen and met invaded her head. She pictured all their smiling faces; she saw them eating and dancing peacefully – carrying out their daily lives, just as if they were no different from humans and she gritted her teeth. </p><p> Aware that her thoughts were drifting dangerously towards something she didn\'t like, Evie closed her eyes and let out a shaky sigh. She grabbed her bow and arrows and looked up. She realised she was feeling angry again – angry with herself. </p><p> A beautiful bird unexpectedly flew into view and she remembered what she told her maids. A bitter smile curved on her lips and she raised her bow and aimed at the beautiful bird singing joyfully. And she started to tremble. She couldn\'t even shoot an animal. Even when she was back home, she knew that her skill in archery was useless because she couldn\'t put it to use. She could only shoot a non-living target. </p><p> Evie suddenly felt like crying. She stood there, alone and lost in her dismal thoughts. She didn\'t even realize that it was already twilight until she felt a chill that crawled through her spine – one that was not caused by the cold but by something else. </p><p> She whipped around behind her and her eyes slowly widened in alarm. </p><p> A wolf was staring at her. </p><p> Evie froze in fear. She immediately remembered the beasts Gavriel had killed in the dark valley. This wolf wasn\'t as huge as those beasts, but it was definitely bigger and scarier than the normal wolves she usually encountered and had seen back home. It took a step towards her and bared its fangs. With the next step, it was snarling at her and its red eyes were fixed on her. </p><p> When the wolf moved without taking its eyes off her, Evie\'s eyes trailed its every single movement. She was overcome with fear, but she realized she was holding her bow arrow and they were ready to be shot. Her survival instinct kicked in and she lifted her weapon and wasted no time in aiming it at the wolf. </p><p> She didn\'t know how she managed but it seemed like her body knew what needed to be done. Her hands were trembling, her body so stiff but with the weapon aimed and locked onto the wolf made the animal still for a moment before it started to circle her. Evie followed it\'s every move, never letting herself get distracted even though she felt sweat trickling down her back. She didn\'t know what else she could do. She doubted the use of her screaming for help after thinking through for a bit. Screaming would not be of much use as she was quite certain that the wolf would most probably get to her before her maids could even reach her. </p><p> One wrong move and she was done for. And her hands were still trembling. She was aiming for the area between its eyes, but could she hit with her current condition? </p><p> Evie nearly smiled in both fear and utter disbelief. She couldn\'t believe what was happening. She was prepared to deal with the vampires and rescue herself against them. But that did not involve rescuing herself against a wild animal. </p><p> The forest became so eerily quiet. Evie could no longer hear anything but the heavy thumping of her heartbeat and the sounds of her feet moving so slowly as she continued the same circling motions, following the predator that was circling her. Was it truly her fate to come to a foreign land and die in the jaws of an animal? </p><p> Evie choked back on her tears and somehow, the shivering in her hands settled a little. However, the wolf that was growling menacingly suddenly stilled and warning bells rang in Evie\'s head. It\'s going to attack now! </p><p> Evie\'s trembling started again as she carefully took a small step back. No! Don\'t! </p><p> The next moment, the wolf made a move. Time seemed to stop and before she knew it, the wolf was leaping towards her. Her lips opened and she didn\'t know why she uttered Gavriel\'s name as she released her arrow. </p>'),(307,13,'Chapter 23 - Terror',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> Inside a luxurious receiving room, Gavriel was sitting across the general and Thea. </p><p> The general had been formal and polite but Gavriel would never forget the look in this man\'s eyes every time this exalted general turned his gaze on him when Gavriel was still young, until before he left the empire. Like all of the other high-ranking officials, this man was another thick-skinned hypocrite who only knew how to judge based on outward appearances and political gains. </p><p> Time had gone by and yet, the general was still babbling on about things Gavriel did not even care about. Anyone could tell that the robust and huge general was beating around the bush, perhaps trying to appeal to the prince\'s good side or elicit a positive reaction from him before finally landing on his real purpose. But Gavriel never spoke. He looked as if almost all expressions were wiped off from his good-looking face. Except for that cold expression his men knew so well – the adamantine one that meant it was easier to move a mountain or kill a dragon than to change his mind about something. </p><p> Elias had just entered the room when finally, the general stopped beating around the bush. </p><p> \"Prince Gavriel, I came to speak with you about your engagement with my daughter, Thea. You are the most intelligent young man I have ever met so I believe I need not state the very obvious reasons why I intend to hasten your wedding with my daughter. Even though you had just married the other day…\" the general continued speaking, not knowing that his words had already turned into a background noise to Gavriel the instant Elias entered the room. </p><p> The prince had met Elias\' eyes and his first question was to ask him whether or not Elias had escorted his wife back to her chambers. When Elias told him that the Lady insisted to continue hunting a bird in the little forest, Gavriel\'s face darkened. </p><p> \"So, you\'re telling me she\'s still there until now?\" he asked the butler through their eyes and when Elias nodded, the prince abruptly rose, causing the General be a little startled and to stop talking. </p><p> Gavriel\'s gaze fell outside the window and when he saw that it was almost twilight, he grabbed his jacket and without a word, he stormed out of the room as if nobody and nothing else mattered, leaving the general dumbfounded, with his mouth hanging open. </p><p> \"Your Highness, where are you going? Did you even hear what the general had just said?\" It was Zolan who had chased after him. \"You can\'t just leave the general like that. He\'d be a huge help to you. What you need most right now is an ally …\" </p><p> Zolan let out a defeated sigh because as soon as they reached a window, the prince jumped down and disappeared without a word. It seems like his only choice now was to go back and entertain the general until Gavriel finishes whatever was it that caused him to rush off like that. Although, at the back of his mind, he is almost a hundred percent certain that it could only be her. </p><p> … </p><p> Meanwhile, at that very moment, in the little forest, Evie was on the ground, frozen in utter horror. Something filthy and cold and dark had been splashed on her pale skin and hair and over her dress. Her already marble-like pale face became even whiter as if all her blood was drained from her face. </p><p> The beast had been shot precisely in its left eye. Her arrow flew strong and was now buried deep in its eye socket as some dark viscous liquid that appeared to be its blood was gushing out as the beast growled thunderously while shaking its large head violently in front of her, hoping that the movements would make the arrow dislodge and fall out on its own. The bone-chilling sound, the bloodied beast, and the dark blood splashing everywhere… Evie had never experienced such primal fear. </p><p> She felt as though her lungs had stopped working and her breathing was on a strike since that moment the beast leapt towards her. Her whole frame was shaking, as if there was no part of her body that was under her control now. </p><p> If it was a normal wolf, it should have been dead by now, and yet, it was still standing. It somehow seems as if it was going to heal itself soon – not dissimilar on how vampires heal themselves whenever they get wounded. Evie\'s instinct and adrenaline kicked in not a second later, despite the fear that had consumed her. As her trembling body moved and crawled blindly on the ground, she could not even bring herself to open her mouth to scream. </p><p> Evie\'s pounding heart and the sounds of the beast in pain was all she could hear now, still unable to take her eyes off away from it. Her body seemed to know that the moment she turned her back to run, the beast would attack her from behind. When her pale trembling hand had touched one of the many arrows she had taken with her, Evie frantically prepared her weapon and lifted it again, aiming for a crucial spot on the beast. </p><p> It was as if the beast had sensed another source of danger, it suddenly stilled, and its one remaining eye burned darkly as it looked at her. Evie felt as though she was staring at the gates of hell. The terror that ran through her was too much for her to handle. </p><p> Another arrow flew without warning and because of the uncontrollable tremors, the arrow hit the beast\'s legs instead of hitting the mark at the middle of its forehead. Evie frantically picked another arrow without taking her eyes off the beast but before she could even get it notched on her bow, the beast snarled in anger and it leaped. Towards her. </p><p> Her heart froze as though fully encased in a block of ice. The next thing she knew, she was looking up at the huge beast airborne and about to land a killing blow on her. She did not know how possible was it that she could still move but she felt her hands clasped the arrow in the event she get the chance to stab it into the beast once it reached her. That probably was a futile move, but she was out of other options. </p><p> Funnily enough, the beast didn\'t seem to land when she expected it to. The wolf had been hit by what seemed to be a sword that had been used as a spear mid-air and disappeared in a blur from her sight. There was then sound of a tree falling coming from the direction where the wolf\'s flying body disappeared to. </p><p> Before she could wrap her head around what had happened and another heartbeat had passed, she was firmly lifted up from the cold ground that she was sitting on. Something solid, warm, and exuding the feeling of safety held her close. </p><p> \"Evie!\" she heard her name called out in a suspiciously frantic tone and when she blinked and saw Gavriel\'s worried face filling her vision, she just spaced out and stared until he called her name again. \"Evie! I\'m here now, I\'ve got you.\" </p><p> Her heart seemed to finally resume beating again but this time it decided to make up for the pause from earlier and started racing too hard, too fast – causing her chest to ache from the strain of her breathing. \"G-gav…\" </p><p> \"Yes. I\'m here, wife.\" </p><p> \"T-t-take me away from h...\" </p><p> Immediately, her feet left the ground, and the feeling of being cradled and enveloped in something comfortable all at the same time. She clutched her frozen fingers into his clothes, not knowing why there was that feeling as though she was being strangled. </p><p> \"Evie. You\'re safe now, love.\" his lips curving gently against the cold rim of her ear as he whispered. She didn\'t even realize that Gavriel had already lowered her down onto the grassy meadow just outside the forest as he cradled her. His hands were moving swiftly over her bodice and hastily unhooking her corset. </p><p> She felt like her lungs were about to burst and no matter how hard she breaths, she could not seem to get enough air. And then his voice suddenly sounded as if it was coming from a great distance before everything suddenly turned dark. </p>'),(308,13,'Chapter 24 - Outburst',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> When Evie finally regained consciousness, it was already morning and there was a sliver of bright sunlight streaming in from the small opening in the curtains. Gavriel was already inside the room when she came out from the dressing room. However, she simply threw him a glance and refused to look at him after politely thanking him for saving her. </p><p> She had donned on a mask of irreproachable serenity and proceeded to inform her husband very formally that she wished to be left alone when the man tried to strike up a conversation with her. Still, he never glared at her neither was he angered by her sudden coldness towards him. But one could see the surly look in his eyes as he stared longingly at his wife. </p><p> Even during meals, Evie continued to act indifferent towards Gavriel. Her gaze never lingered longer than a second and she answered all his questions as curt and as monotonous as possible until Gavriel stopped talking to her as well. When she told him to leave her alone the third time, her husband never came to their chambers again. </p><p> And then, three days went by so fast. That was probably the most torturous days in her life. She had blamed herself and her heart for being so easily and quickly enthralled by him. She had put herself into that nightmarish event and nearly died because of being ridiculously jealous. She believed that it was all her fault for being so stupid. And she even thought that that was probably a warning sign for her that falling for him would only bring about her disaster. She had known that all along. True, legally he was her husband, but at the same time, he was also her enemy. When that day comes and her father would rescue her and attack the vampire kingdom with his dragons, she and her husband would be forced to go against each other. </p><p> She could not imagine what would happen if that day came, and she was already deeply and madly in love with him. Falling for him would earn her nothing but a shattered heart and hell and damnation in the end. Because there would be no way she can ever betray or turn her back on her family and the entire human race for him. So, all she could do now was to shut herself inside her own walls and harden her heart, if that was what it takes – even if it ends up killing her. </p><p> \"Have a goodnight, milady.\" Fray and Gina curtsied, and she nodded listlessly at them. She had turned her gaze towards the window and sighed so deeply when they were gone. </p><p> Clad in a pure white sleeping gown, Evie rose and was about to walk towards the window to get a better view of the moon when she felt rather than heard the door open. She thought her maids had forgotten something but when she turned around to look, a pair of silvery moon-lit eyes met hers. </p><p> She stood frozen, as if just by the sight of him would paralyze her. He was clad in all-black garments and his hair was tussled very attractively. She couldn\'t help but remember the sight of him when he was standing in the middle of the pile of dead beasts back when they crossed the Dark Valley. The only difference this time was that his garments weren\'t splattered all over with those black and green unidentified liquids and his eyes weren\'t blood red. The worse thing for her was that the roughening of his looks made him look even more breathtakingly stunning in her eyes. There was a niggling curiosity at the back of her mind, wondering where he had been for the last three days that she did not see him. </p><p> Evie had to clench her fists and inconspicuously press her fingernails into her palms to distract herself from dwelling on useless thoughts when she began to think that he must have had spent his days with his fiancée and was busy with whatever arrangement they had agreed on with the general. </p><p> \"I\'m back,\" he said. His voice tender and soft compared to his dishevelled, roguish look. </p><p> He took a step closer to her, but Evie remained rooted to her spot, unmoving and just following him with her eyes. Taking off his coat, his eyes briefly surveyed her. \"Are you alright now, wife?\" he asked gently, a glimmer of genuine concern flashed in his eyes. </p><p> She clenched her fists even tighter. Why? Why was he so nice to her? How could she even… </p><p> Gritting her teeth, Evie frantically thought about what she should do. She could not hold her ground if this continued. His kindness and her traitorous heart would erode her will in standing firm in her decisions of not having feelings for him. </p><p> \"Yes…Yes, I\'m fine. But I still wished to be left alone.\" </p><p> A deafening silence followed as Evie begged him silently in her heart that he would quietly leave the room again. But this time, he didn\'t. A long and deep sigh escaped his lips. </p><p> \"Forgive me but I\'m not going to listen to you this time, wife. I never believed it was a good idea to leave you alone. Let\'s talk, Evie.\" His voice softened as he bent closer to her while she took a step back. However, her reaction no longer stopped Gavriel in his tracks like before. He stepped forward, maintaining their close distance as he kept speaking in a hoarse but gentle tone. \"Tell me what\'s wrong. Did I do something wrong? Tell me, Evie.\" </p><p> Evie swallowed hard. She could feel the hot sting of tears just behind her eyes, threatening to spill over at the first sign of more care and concern on his part. His scent and the warmth of his breath went through her like the most delicious of wines and it took all she had just to step back and retreat. Warning bells began to ring in her ears, and those walls that she had built around her heart so painstakingly with blood, sweat and tears were already threatening to crumble. She knew it would only take a little more push and her defences would come crumbling down like a deck of cards downed by a puff of air. The fear, the calculations, the promises, the thoughts, and determination were all starting to tremble like dandelion seeds about to be scattered with the wind, threatening to leave nothing but the full brunt that this man had on her senses. </p><p> The panic of giving in to him forced Evie to burst. \"There is nothing wrong Gavriel! Just ignore me and go to your fiancée and spend as many days there with her as you wish!\" </p><p> Gavriel stilled, obviously shocked with her words. \"You think…\" he paused. \"You think I was with Thea the last three days?\" </p><p> \"Yes! Weren\'t you? Don\'t tell me you\'re that shameful to deny it after being able to do it? Don\'t even try because I already know she\'s the one you really want to be your wife!\" she sneered as her words tumbled out of her mouth, pouring out the hurt that was kept in her heart for days. She knew she had overstepped her boundaries, but she could not hold anything back once her dam burst. </p><p> \"What made you even think –\" Gavriel was shocked at the pain that was reflected in Evie\'s eyes and the obvious distress he heard in her voice that he could not continue his train of thought. </p><p> \"While I was in the forest all alone – homesick and hurt – what were you doing? You were merrily sitting there with her and the general, talking and planning out your lovely marriage! But it\'s okay. I don\'t care! You can go back to her right now and marry her immediately. Since she\'s the woman you love and need after all! So just leave me alone. I\'m sure three days is not enough for you.\" </p><p> The outburst of her fury lingered in the air, like a palpable thing, waiting to be addressed. She had just thought about provoking him so that he\'d leave her alone again. That, and also to stop him from moving closer to save her walls from crumbling down. She didn\'t expect herself to end up revealing all the pain and distress welled up in her heart and uttering it all with real resentment. It had all come out before it even registered in her mind. Evie herself, was surprised at the depths of her own feelings and grudges that she did not expect the things she had said to resonate so profoundly within her. </p><p> A heavy silence reigned between them. Evie was silenced at the sight of his eyes and his offended expression. His eyes suddenly looked like they were frozen, and this was the very first time he had let his eyes turned that chilly while looking at her. </p>'),(309,13,'Chapter 25 - When That Day Comes',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p> Evie swallowed. </p><p> \"I never even saw her shadow, nor had I planned to meet up with her within the last three days, Evielyn.\" Came his firm voice and Evie could only bit her lower lip. She suddenly knew that she was wrong in judging just according to his expressions and reactions alone. </p><p> \"I… I… that…\" </p><p> As she stammered, Gavriel stretched his hands suddenly – too suddenly – and slammed them on either side of her, against the wall that was somehow behind her. She stumbled backwards in surprise, finally realizing that she had stepped back from him for so long she had already reached the wall. </p><p> When she looked up at him, their faces almost collided and she pulled her head back as far as she could without slamming her own head into the wall. However, when she saw the creases between his brows and the intensity of his glittering eyes that held hers, Evie found herself unable to either pull her gaze away or make a sound. </p><p> However, she realised very quickly that her reactions were not out of fear. But it was because she recognised that in his eyes, there was still a soft liquid glitter as he looked at her, despite the quiet anger that radiated from his body and the bruised expression on his face he could no longer conceal. </p><p> The room went painfully quiet for a while before Evie\'s heart began to thud almost audibly. The next moment, she felt his warm breath touching her ear as his body tensed. \"The talk about marriage with Thea had no chance of even happening because I left them to look for you that twilight just at the moment the general was ready to start talking about it. When I carried you back into the castle, I had already sent them away without even seeing them off and that was the last time I saw that pair of father and daughter, Evielyn.\" He explained slowly, his struggle to keep his voice soft was apparent and she could tell his breathing wasn\'t quite even. \"Now you\'re telling me Thea is the woman I want and need?\" his voice hardened at that last statement before he pulled away to look down at her. </p><p> His quicksilver eyes were so intense she felt like her brain was going to malfunction and suffer a meltdown. </p><p> \"You… damned… woman…\" she heard him curse her for the very first time and it seemed he said those words with so much struggle. And then his breath snagged. \"How could you be so clueless?\" the hardness of his voice softened but his whisper this time was hoarse and deep as if they came from the darkest chamber of her mind. </p><p> \"Listen Evie,\" he breathed against her lips and the waft of hellfire sent shivers through her and goosebumps crawling along her skin. </p><p> \'No! This cannot be happening!\' she screamed within the confines of her mind because Evie could feel her carefully constructed walls that she spent so long building around her heart and mind began to crumble and she was becoming more and more helpless to her husband\'s \'attacks\' on her fortress. </p><p> It seemed she could not hold her ground any longer. In the past three days, when her anger towards herself had begun to subside, her mind similarly started to gain clarity. She remembered how he came to rescue her, even held her so gently at that moment and took care of her to no end like he was so worried about her. She realized he had never raised his voice at her nor scolded her. Her traitorous mind also brought up the memory on how he had tried his best to speak to her, asking her many times if she was alright and even coaxed her many times that he will never let something like that happen to her ever again. And all she did was sent him away coldly, despite knowing that she could be dead by then if he didn\'t come to her rescue right at the moment that he did. </p><p> The emotions she went through those past three days without him were too much that if she honestly admitted to herself, she almost felt like breaking down. She hadn\'t let anyone console her after that period of horror she had just gone through. She never did open up to her maids nor to Elias either, just so she would not fall into the temptation of asking about him and his whereabouts. She had sent her maids away almost immediately after their job was done and she knew the maids and the butler were starting to worry and even probably thought badly of her ungrateful attitude – not that she would blame them. She truly was horrid in her behaviour! However, she could hardly consider the feelings and thoughts of the maids and the butler at that time as she was too engrossed in her own stubbornness, thickening and strengthening her defences and fighting against everything that had been haunting her. </p><p> And it was… maddening for her. Because he had haunted her endlessly and mercilessly even when he was not there. Though she did not admit it earlier, but she knew deep in her heart that her walls weren\'t strong enough to repel a man like him so she had tried her very best, giving all sorts of excuses to herself, until… she could no longer… </p><p> \"There is no woman in this universe I ever needed and wanted more than you!\" he growled passionately, those silvery eyes shining intensely at her and all her walls evaporated faster than the mist in the face of the noonday sun. \"If I have had the luxury to spend three days with Thea… I would rather spend every waking minute of that time with you. Do you want to know what I\'d have done with you…to you in those three days? Evie? I would spend every minute and every second to please you, to show you how much I wanted you, how much I long to finally be allowed to touch and enjoy my own wife. I would do everything to make you feel safe with me and then worked as hard as I could to gain your trust until you will finally trust me enough to… to let me hold you, to permit me to touch you. And when that time comes…\" his voice turned into a ragged whisper. </p><p> \"When that day comes, I would do my best and would be as gentle or as wild as you want me to be. First and foremost, I would hold you close to me and feel your warmth against mine, make you comfortable in my arms. I\'d brush your hair gently, worship every inch of your skin, hold your waist against mine and then… I\'d kiss you. I\'d kiss you passionately and then when you open up for me, I\'d slide my tongue inside your mouth. I would invade your mouth … lick every corner of it until you moan for me. I\'d tangle my tongue against yours and then suck and lick yours until we\'re both breathless and hot and aroused. I\'d kiss you again and again until your lip swells from my loving and then… my tongue will travel downwards. First along your jaws… I\'d lick them like they were the most delicious thing…\" his hot breath followed his words, blowing against her jaws and then downwards as he continued. </p><p> \"I\'d lick and kiss and suck the hollow of your neck and below your ears while my hands roams around your body. I\'d suck your skin and leave a mark as I take off your dress, and then… I\'d put my hands beneath your breast…\" Evie let out an embarrassing gasp, her head feeling faint from all that intimate description. Her face flushed red as she looked at him with wide-eyes, unable to speak. </p><p> His eyes flashed a fierce glint as he groaned low, pleased by her reactions and continued with an even more alluring voice. \"I\'d ravish your mouth again while I knead your breasts until you wriggle beneath me in heat. And … when you\'re ready, I\'d lift your breast to my mouth…I would kiss them, Evie, suck them gently, nibble them until they are wet and so hard…\" another gasp sounded, accompanied by a needy moan echoed in their ears and Evie\'s hand flew to her mouth in shock. </p>'),(310,14,'Chapter 1 Loving My Wife',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 1 Loving My Wife</h3><p></p><p>It was a midnight and raining heavily...</p><p>A black car was running at a high speed towards the old mansion in an outskirts of the capital. The mansion was a bit old and it seems that nobody stayed there but was maintained in a good condition. Only few lights at the entrance were on.</p><p>A car stopped in front of a huge iron gate. Car\'s door opened and a woman in her late 20\'s got out of it. The woman looked like was in a hurry and was searching someone. She entered through the gate and ran inside, making her way through the rain. She looked worried and anxious. While running inside, she stopped midway and instead of going towards the mansion door she moved towards the huge garden area which was on the left side. Except at the entrance only the lights in the garden were on. She started running on the pavement which was directing towards the garden. After crossing few trees, she stopped at a certain distance away from a patio, which was in the centre of the garden.</p><p>A circular shade supported with 4 strong pillars having a beautiful design carved on it. There were two small semi circular wooden tables to sit inside it. It located in the centre of quite a big circular fish pond and was connected to the land with small wooden bridge. </p><p>Her expressions changed as if she found what she was looking for and got relaxed while breathing heavily. In that shade, there was a figure facing in an opposite direction to where the woman was standing. It was a man in his early 20s. He was wearing a white shirt and black pant. His suit jacket was lying on one of the semicircular sitting table. Shirt\'s sleeves were folded upward and his hands were tucked in his pant\'s pockets. Top two buttons were undone showing part of his strong chest and collar bones.</p><p>His features were sharp, pointed nose, deep black eyes, strong jaw line, thin and attractive lips, his skin was fair and looked radiant in a light emitting from the orange shade light bulbs which were hanging to the ceiling of patio. His build was strong. his black hairs were quite damp and messy may be because of the rain and pointed downward towards his eyes. His expressions were blank with his eyes staring in the dark without any emotions.</p><p>The girl soaked in a rain walked forward and stopped few steps away from him.. She called his name, \"Lu Lijun!!\". He noticed it but there was no reply. She was angry but she controlled it and said again, \"Do you have any idea, how much everyone is worried about you? Everyone one is searching for you out there. Let\'s go back!!\" </p><p>\"I don\'t want to.\" He said without looking at her. </p><p>\"Then what do you want to do Haaaaa!!!? Ok let it be then. I am not here to handle your tantrums. Just give me an answers to my questions so that I can explain it to others. Why did you walk out of your marriage at the last moment?? Tell me!!\" </p><p>Still there was no reply from him as he was not feeling guilty about anything and she got more irritated. Then she just started asking him all the things she had in her mind without a pause. </p><p>\"How can you do this to Liwei ? Do you know how much you hurt her? If you didn\'t want to marry her why did you agree for that? Why did you give her false hopes. And what about father?? How can you make him lower his head in front of everyone?\"</p><p>She was burning with an anger shouting at him. But there was no reaction from him. He was calm just staring blankly in a dark. There was only a sound of rain and wind.</p><p>After getting no reply from him , she yelled again. \"Lu Lijun!! I need an answer. What\'s in your mind?? What are you thinking to act so recklessly?? Why are you being like this? Just tell me, why did you do that ?? Whyyy?? </p><p>He turned slowly, took one step towards her and while looking in her eyes he said, \"Because I love you YuYan\". His voice was calm and when he called her name his eyes were filled with a love and warmth. He looked very relax as if the burden on his heart had been lifted.. He looked calm and compose just staring at her.</p><p>She was shocked that her eyes were wide open, shakingly she took few steps back and stood there with a support from the pillar beside her as if she had heard something terrible. She got back to her senses, her eyes were furious. \"What did you just say? Are you out of your mind? Are you crazy? how can y.....\"</p><p>Before she could finish her sentence, Lu Lijun Moved towards her, grabbed her hands and pushed her to the pillar besides her. Before she could react he kissed her. She was shocked, tried to push him away but his grip was very strong. More she struggled, more strong it got. after few moments, he stopped kissing but still pressing her against the pole. His face was still close to her as they could feel each others breath. Looking in her eyes he asked, \"Why? Am I not allowed to go crazy for you?\" And before she could react he kissed her again and this time it was more intense trying to engulf her completely. </p><p>He bite her lower lip. She felt a current of pain running through her body. She was still trying to push him away as she was unable to breath. After few minutes he stopped and again looked into her eyes like he was expecting to see something. But there was nothing other than shock and anger. She was furious and asked \"w...what do you think you are doing?\" She tried to push him away and run but there was no use.</p><p>He pulled her back and hold her even more tightly. Caught her left hand behind her back with his right hand and his left hand was on the back of her neck holding her head at a place and then he answered her question while looking into her eyes intensely, \"I am loving my wife\". Claiming his right on her he kissed and kissed her again like the feelings he kept burried in his heart for long time were exploding at once....</p><p></p>'),(311,14,'Chapter 2 I miss you please come back',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 2 I miss you!! please come back!!</h3><p></p><p>After few minute Lu Lijun felt something was not right. He realised that she had stopped struggling and he felt something moist on his cheek.. he stopped kissing and looked at her, his breath was still heavy. Her eyes were closed and tears were rolling down from them. She was standing there like a lifeless body. He came back to his senses. He slowly let go of her hand which he was holding tightly behind her back followed by the hand holding her head. He released her and moved few steps back.</p><p>Still it was raining heavily and sounds of lightning became more frightening. When he looked at her, he felt a pain deep down in his heart, as if the lightning had strucked to his heart and burning it to the ashes. He didn\'t know what to say or what to do?? He just stood there looking at her in a daze.. </p><p>After realising that he had retreated, she opened her teary eyes. Her expressions were painful and full of disgust. She moved towards him, slapped him hard. Then she ran away from there, making a way through that heavy rain. While running, suddenly her feet entangled with small tree branches fell from tree because of the rain. She fell down and hurt her knees and right palm but immediately stood up as if not feeling a pain and started to run towards the iron gate. Sharp rain drops were hitting her body but she couldn\'t feel anything because the pain in her heart was more intense than anything else. The agony in her heart was not letting her feel anything. She was running as if this place was a hell and the demon in the hell was chasing after her.</p><p>Lu Lijun was watching her retreating back. When he saw her falling down on the pavement and hurting herself, he wanted to run and help her but before that she got up and ran away. He felt pain in his heart as he saw her running in heavy rain hurting herself. But he couldn\'t do anything as he was scared to make a situation worst for her and stood frozen at the place where he was and continued watching her, running away from him.</p><p>Somehow Jiang YuYan reached outside the gate of mansion. When she saw her car, she hurriedly entered into it, started the engine and with the full speed moved away from that place. After some distance she stopped the car at roadside and was crying her heart out while leaning on the steering wheel.</p><p>Some time passed by just like that, crying her heart out. Her face was swollen and eyes were red due to crying. She was drenched in rain but was not feeling cold. She looked lost as if she didn\'t know what to do or where to go?</p><p>Since Lu Qiang passed away, she never thought about her life. She was very young at that time just 20yrs old. She could have started a new life but she devoted herself to protect the people and things he left behind and tried her best to make all his dreams come true. Her love for Lu Qiang was something that will never end even if he was not with her. She closed her eyes and collected herself. She increased temperature in a car as she felt cold. She started the car engine and drove in the direction of Lu family\'s current residence.</p><p>When YuYan reached at current Lu residence it was already 3am. Guard greeted her and opened the gate. She drove inside and parked the car. When she got out of the car she suddenly felt breeze of chilled air hitting her body and making her feet trembled. Her teeth started to make chattering sound. She crossed her hand tightly around her chest and dashed inside the villa. She hurriedly walked to the 2nd floor and entered in her room. She threw the car keys on bed and ran into the bathroom. She started hot water shower and stood under it. </p><p>As she closed her eyes she remembered what happened earlier, when she went to look for Lu Lijun. She opened her eyes as she felt disgusted. She looked at shelf in the bathroom and took out the body wash bottle from it. She opened it, poured it on her and started to scrub again and again as if something was stucked to her body and was not able to remove it. In that frustration she started crying again. She looked into the mirror on the opposite wall. She was staring at her face and was observing it. When her sight stopped at her lips she started to rub it with her palms. Tears were still rolling down from her eyes.</p><p>After being in a shower for a while, she cleaned herself and got out of the bathroom, covered in bathrobe. She sat on the corner of the bed. Her sight fell on the small wooden photoframe which had her wedding pic.</p><p>In that pic, YuYan was wearing a beautiful and elegant white wedding dress and Lu Qiang was wearing a black tuxedo. Both were looking adorable while facing each other and were looking into the eyes with love and smile full of happiness. Both of his hands were on her waist holding her close to him and her hands were placed lightly on his chest.</p><p>She held the frame in her hand, looked at the picture and said,\" Why did you leave me here alone?\" Her voice was cracking as she was crying and sobbing. \"You...you promised me that you will always be there with me a...and will never ever leave me. You pro....promised to protect me. You said that we will grow old together. I trusted you. But why?? W.....why did you break your promise?? I...I hate you!! I hate you Lu Qiang!!! I hate you!!!!. </p><p>She hold the frame tightly to her chest. Closed her eyes and started to mumble,\" I....I miss you!!! Please come back!! P..please!! Lu Qiang!!

A beautiful chandelier was hanging at the centre of the ceiling giving it a royal look. Most of the interior was in white colour. Walls were decorated with the attractive expensive paintings. Each painting had small wall lamp at their top which made paintings looks beautiful under the light coming from them. Each of the corners were occupied with few antics.

Don\'t forget the origin of all of yours very existance on the earth and that\'s our marriage.\" As expected everyone was speechless while his wife Lu Shuang looked calm as she knew her husband\'s nature, never left any chance to show his strong presence by mocking his two sons and has an ability to leave everyone speechless with his sharp and witty words.</p><p>Lu Jinhai : \'...\' (father never disappoints me.. :) :) )</p><p>Lu Jiahui : \'...\'</p><p>Lu Chen : \'...\' (what was the point in asking dear brother??)</p><p>Lu Hui : \'...\'</p><p>Others :\'....\'</p><p>Elder Lu Huan was an old but very lively person. At the same time he was moody. If he was in good mood, he could be a baby angel from heavenly realm, but if he was in bad mood you could see that baby angel transforming into a devil. No one dared to defy him. Even his elder son Lu jinhai, who was one of the powerful businessman in the country always bowed down in front of his father. Same goes for his younger son Lu Chen.</p><p>Everyone in the family respected and loved elder Lu Huan because he always gave priority to his family over everything. He never stopped his children from doing what they wanted to do and always supported them. He loved his wife Lu Shuang a lot, that even at this age everyone could see his affection towards her. </p><p>Lu Shuang was very beautiful and a graceful old lady. She was very soft hearted towards everyone but strict at a time. Only she was able to make elder Lu Huan from scary lion to an obedient dog..(wufff. Wufff!!)</p><p>Lu family\'s men always loved and respected their wives and never betrayed them. It continued from generations. It was as if this family\'s men were carrying an extra chromosome other than chromosome X and Y in their body. The special chromosome \'M\' , meant for the characters of \"MONOGAMY\"..</p><p>Atmosphere was silent, Lu Huan looked at everyone and talked again, \" As we are talking about your origins, we ( Lu Huan and Lu shuang) want to make ourself more proud and take one step ahead as an originators.\"</p><p>Everyone was confused and looked at each other to understand the meaning. Then elder Lu Huan saw these clueless people and frowned. \" I mean to say thaaaat....!! now it\'s time for us to see our great- grandchildren\". Upon hearing this and understanding the meaning everyone gave sigh of relief.</p><p>Lu Chen : \"But father we can\'t do anything about it. Your grandchildren won\'t listen to us. Everyone try to avoid this marriage subject so having great grandchildren is far from reality.\" Lu Jinhai nodded in agreement.</p><p>Lu Huan : \" Morons!!!, you can\'t even convince your children. Who is asking them to get married??. To make a baby marriage is not necessary. \" Again everyone one was speechless. Then he continued, \" They just have to get a woman and .....aauuchh\". Before he could continue, Lu shuang pinched him hard on his arm to stop her shameless husband and said, \" stop being brazen and don\'t try to make my grandchildren immoral just like you so stop pestering them to fullfil your wishes.\" </p><p>Lu jinhai : (\' \') ,. (Exactly mother)</p><p>Lu Chen : \'.....\', (why did I speak). </p><p>Others : _ _ _ _ ( we should have brought ear buds)</p><p>Lu Huan couldn\'t say anything cause he didn\'t dare to cross his wife and moreover what she said made sense as Lu Huan got her pregnant before marriage and she was quite angry about that.</p><p>Everyone new about this fact and they were looking at Lu Huan that how this blantant person became like a scared cat in front of his wife. Everyone was happy in there heart to see this but couldn\'t show their happiness on their faces. Lu Huan\'s sight passed across his both sons. He knew they were happy inside so he frowned and looked at them with killer gaze and startled them as if conversing through their eyes, \" you rascals!!! Why you were in hurry to land on the earth?? You people distroyed my romantic life and took my wife away.\"</p><p>Lu Jinhai and Lu Chen : \" father is a lier!! Your romantic life was rocking that\'s why we were able to land here that soon...hehe!!!</p><p>Lu Huan : \" Both of you will pay for this soon..hahaha!!!\"</p><p>Both brothers could see devilish smile on their father\'s face and eyes full of mischief.</p><p>Lu Jinhai: \'__\' (where to look?)</p><p>Lu chen: \'__\'!!

Made me drain my energy, you punk!!\"</p><p>Lu Jinhai : hmmm...that....umm \'__\'. Lu Jinhai knew his father very well. He liked his childish and bickering attitude because it was one of the reasons of their families playful atmosphere. That\'s why he did that on purpose.</p><p>To change the topic Lu shuang asked,\" where is Lu Qiang?. I am missing my dear grandson. When will he be back?\" As she mentioned Lu Qiang\'s name atmosphere got to normal and everyone was asking about him. </p><p>Lu Jiahui: \" Mother he is in America right now regarding some important company related matter. He would be leaving tomorrow evening from New York and will be here next morning.\"</p><p>Lu Shuang : \"ohh!! That child, since when he took Lu corporation and this family\'s responsibility on his shoulder, he never disappointed us and all these years he worked hard without a rest to take the business one step ahead.</p><p>Lu Qiang was an elder son of Lu Jinhai. Five years back when Lu Jinhai got in an accident and was in a serious condition, Lu Qiang was only 18 years old. He took all the responsibility of company and family in his hand and worked hard to cross boundries of more and more success. He sacrificed his dream to become soccer player for this. He knew how hard his father worked for this and always made everyone to spend there lives in comfort and without worries.</p><p>Lu Huan : \" that\'s what I am worried about.\" He looked at Lu Jinhai and said, \" you heartless man!! How can you make your son work like a bull!! I am afraid that it will affect his health and his vitality. What will happen to my dream of having great grandchildren??\" You irresponsible brat!!!\"</p><p>\" Father I am responsible that\'s why I was able to give you two grandsons and one grand-daughter.\" He said with small ghost smile on his face.</p><p>\"What\'s so great about that?? Everyone do that. You just handle your Lu corporation and give my grandson a little rest\" he frowned and mumbled, \" useless Chairman of the Lu corporation!!!\" but everyone heard it.</p><p>Lu Jinhai was the chairman of Lu corporation, one of the richest and powerful organisation in the country. It was the result of 30 year\'s heardwork of Lu Jinhai. He started it from a scratch.</p><p>The Lu family was basically from a small town far away from the capital. Lu Jinhai\'s ancestors lead that town and small villages around them from generations. Every generation contributed for the development and the well being of the familys around there, that\'s why everyone respected the Lu clan.</p><p>Lu Jinhai\'s dreams to do something extra-ordinary in life brought whole family into the city. Initially he started his business with traditional chinese arts and crafts made in his town. It was speciality of the area around that town. Lu Jinhai realised its importance and established a small company. It was not that difficult for him initially as his family was well off and his grandfather was a head of the town. But difficult part was when he moved to the capital. He had to face so many difficulties like mischievous people and competitors. Though he was from town he was very intelligent to identify between Freinds and foes. He knew how to handle those people because he had a cunning side too. If he were to check his IQ at that time it definately would be in three digits.</p><p>Soon he got success in few years and he started to expand his business in different sectors. He got married to his childhood freind and cousin Ning Jiahui. She supported him through thick and thin to fullfil his dream. She was a loving and caring waman loved by her in-laws.</p><p>After 4 years of marriage she gave birth to their first child Lu Qiang followed by one daughter Lu Lian And younger son Lu Lijun. After their marriage Lu Jinhai was very busy with business. He knew he will not be able to give his family proper time and also he didn\'t want to divert his focus as he was just getting succesful so Lu Jinhai and Lu Jiahui decided not to have a child for few years. It was the reason of Lu Qiang\'s late arrival.</p><p>After hearing the word great-grandchildren, something clicked in Lu Hui\'s mind. She was the wife of Lu Huan\'s second son Lu Chen. \"Exactly father!! As an aunt I am worried about Lu Qiang too. He should definitely take some rest and look after his health. His two cousins are there to share his responsibilities in company and father don\'t worry about great grandchildren. Other than Lu Qiang you have two more grandsons who can grant your wish.\" She said with a big smile on her face.</p><p>Lu Huan looked at her annoyingly and said, \" two more grandsons??? Are you talking about your two sons?? one who got married 5 years back because of the adrenaline rush in his body but still don\'t want to have a child and the other one who is always busy in his world, drinking alcohol and taking drugs, roaming around with his useless freinds and spending the hard earned money of this family??\" His face turned red with anger as showing how displeased was he with Lu Hui\'s sons!l</p><p>After hearing this Lu Hui\'s face fell down and the atmosphere in the living room became silent. Nobody dared to mutter a single word from their mouth.</p><p>Lu Huan\'s younger son Lu Chen was a polite person. He was obedient son and brother, but his wife was quite mischievous. They had two sons Lu Han and Lu Feng. The daughter Lu Bao was the youngest. Initially they were in their ancestral town. Lu Chen was supporting his brother by handling business from town but few years back they came to city because elder Lu Huan wanted his whole family to live together and also he was missing his younger son and grandchildren.</p><p></p>'),(314,14,'Chapter 5 She Will Get married Twice',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 5 She Will Get married Twice</h3><p></p><p>Lu Chen got married just after few months of Lu Jinhai\'s marriage. While Lu Jiahui was busy in supporting her husband in his business, Lu Hui gave birth to a son, Lu Han just after the one year of their marriage. Lu Han was eldest son in the family. Lu Hui always wanted him to take the charge of Lu family and the business instead of Lu Qiang\' but that was not possible. Even her second son Lu Feng was older than Lu Qiang by Few months but everything went in the hands of Lu Qiang .These things made her feel bitter. She didn\'t want to acknowledge the fact that Lu Jinhai was the founder of this huge Lu Corporation and he alone established it with his blood and sweat.</p><p>As Lu Huan was angry, it felt like temperature in the room dropped down suddenly. Lu shuang tried to calm down her husband. She knew his anger very well. He was upset with Lu feng because of his bad habits. Nobody in the family had ever done anything to spoil family\'s name but Lu feng was an exception. Lu Han was also being irresponsible to the family too.</p><p>Lu Hui sat there with her head down. She didn\'t dare to look at elder Lu Huan as her sons were at fault. Lu Chen looked at his wife. He was Quite upset with her for saying inappropriate things in front of his father. He knew what was going on in her mind but he couldn\'t do anything as he knew she never listen to anyone.</p><p>After few minutes of silence Lu Jiahui asked, \"what about your best freind jiang Peizhi and his family? Are they coming or not?</p><p>Lu Jinhai looked at her wife and gave small smile as if saying thanx for breaking the ice and said,\" yes dear he is coming and this time his whole family will be here. He was very happy to hear about event. He is eager to meet everyone. He is already here in China with his wife. He was busy with some work so couldn\'t come to visit us but he will be attending the anniversary celebration for sure\", he said with happiness on his face. Afterall he was going to meet his best freind after a long time. Now the atmosphere in the room started to become normal</p><p>Lu Chen: \"Brother, how are their kids. It\'s been 8 years since I saw them. Both of them must be well grown up now. Both were too adorable.\"</p><p>Lu Jinhai: You are right Lu Chen. Both of them took after their parents. Well behaved and talented. This time they are coming too. Jiang Peizhi said that Jiang YuYan and Jiang yang are going stay in China from now on. </p><p>When elder Lu Huan heard about Jiang Peizhi his anger subsidised and he started to give attention to the discussion about Jiang Family. When they mentioned about Jiang Peizhi\'s kids he said,\" I missed Jiang YuYan. It\'s been a while I saw that child. She must have became wonderful lady like her mother.\". Then he started to recall the memories of the past when all these kids used to play together at Lu mansion. Those were few of the blissful moments in his life. He now had a smile on his face. He liked Jiang YuYan alot. </p><p>When everyone saw this change in a mood of elder Lu Huan, they felt relaxed. Later whole family discussed the plan of event and gave necessary instructions to assistant Xio Dong and left for their work.</p><p>___________ _______ ________</p><p>At the same time at Jiang residence....</p><p>After finishing breakfast Jiang Peizhi was reading a news paper and Jiang Ruolan was instructing the servants about the arrangement of two rooms where Jiang Yang and Jiang YuYan were going to stay.

I want them to be comfortable in this house.\"</p><p>Jiang Peizhi : \" Don\'t worry everything will be done soon. \" He then put his news paper aside and looked at Jiang Ruolan and then asked, \" why did you insist on calling Jiang YuYan and Jiang Yang back to china suddenly?? Why did you want them to study here in China??</p><p>Jiang Ruolan was quite startled with these sudden attack of questions out of the blue from Jiang Peizhi. She then replied with calm expressions, \" it\'s nothing!!! I just feel that now it\'s time for them to come back to their home country. I don\'t want them to spend their lives on foreign land. It will be good for them to get familiar with everything here and adjust themselves according. Anyhow Jiang yang is coming back to china forever and I don\'t want Jiang YuYan to stay there alone.\"</p><p>Jiang Peizhi then smiled and hold his wife\'s hand and said, \"Ruolan!!! I want to know the real reason. It\'s been 25 years since we are married. I know you very well. You never did anything without a big reason.

He said while consoling her.</p><p>The handsome man behind them was now curious to know about her dream but Jiang yang suddenly said, \"now close your eyes and take some rest. It was already a tiresome day for us.\" She nodded, leaned back and closed her eyes. The handsome man was quite disappointed. After having dinner everyone went to sleep.</p><p>Next day morning everyone got out of the airport and headed towards there own way. Jiang YuYan\'s sight crossed across the handsome man but she frowned and ignored him, while Jiang Yang nodded with a small smile to the man like compensating for his sister\'s rude behaviour. Handsome man smiled and nodded too.</p><p>At the outside of airport a black Maybach was waiting. Handsome man reached to the car. A car driver bowed and said,\" good morning young master Lu\". Then he opened the car door for him. He sat on back passenger sit and his assistant sat in front passenger seat of the car. </p><p>As the car moved in its way, the man leaned back and was staring outside of the car window. He suddenly remembered the girl\'s startled face and smiled.</p><p>Then he mumbled to himself, \"will see you soon YuYan!!!\" There was a sparkle in his eyes as he was excited about something.</p><p>At the same time, the another car was waiting for Jiang Yang and Jiang YuYan. The driver got out and greeted them. Both sat inside the car and headed towards their destination. It was Jiang Peizhi\'s car and driver. They recognised him as everytime they came to China, this same person received them from airport.</p><p>After sitting inside the car Jiang Yang looked at his sister and asked,\"still upset??? Cheer up!!\"</p><p>Jiang YuYan: \"No!! I am not.\" </p><p>\"Then, why are you still having a long face?\"</p><p>\"I thought about it whole night. I know that I am wrong about our parents. I just said all those things in a feet of an anger.\" She said while thinking about something.</p><p>\"I love them and will do anything they asked me to. And you are right that marriage thing doesn\'t make any sense as we know them very well. It\'s just that, she was supporting my dream until yesterday and now suddenly asked me to do something that I don\'t want to, even without giving me a proper explanation.\"</p><p>Jiang Yang : \" Yes! you are right but mom always think ahead of the things that we don\'t know about. Just trust her!!\"</p><p>Jiang YuYan : \"I know and I trust her a lot brother Yang\"</p><p>Jiang YuYan : \"That\'s like my sweet sister.\" and both smiled looking at each other.</p><p>______ ________ ____________</p><p>At old Lu mansion..</p><p>The black car arrived at the gate.

Lu Jinhai already started to nurture him to prepare for the future, incase there is any kind of emergency.</p><p>He was an obedient and a filial son. He learnt about business as well as the people he might have to deal with in future.</p><p>He was very handsome and talented young man, obviously it was because of the perfect genes from his parents. He was very loving, caring and protective towards his family but at the same time cold towards the outsiders. Anyone could see the difference in his behaviour with his family and others. </p><p>He was a man of few words. In company everyone feared him more than chairman Lu Jinhai, as he had to take some strict actions to deal with trouble makers when he took charge the Lu corporation in his hands.

When I said that??\"</p><p>\"Then what was the meaning of the words you said before?? As you know right now I am not in a condition to help you make your golden words come true??\"</p><p>Lu Huan panicked and said, \"No darling, I can\'t even think about it. You are the only one for me.\" He said with innocent puppy like expressions on his face then he looked at his son and gave him a frightening gaze as calling him \'Rascal\' in his mind.</p><p>Lu Jinhai smiled mischievously while looking at his father as replying to his gaze \'like father, like son\'.</p><p>Everyone one was used to see this 180 degree turn in elder Lu\'s behavior when it comes to his wife, so everyone just smiled. </p><p>Lu Jiahui hugged her son and said,\"you must be tired.

A wild cat crossed my path.\"</p><p>He then continued, \"And I don\'t have such weird habbits.

I won\'t disappoint you with your dream.\" Then he turn back and left, leaving everyone shocked.</p><p>After hearing this last line, everyone was stunned and stood frozen on their places staring at Lu Qiang\'s back untill he disappeared from their sight. </p><p>This is the first time ever Lu Qiang said something like this. Everyone knew he never ever dated anyone or showed interest in any girl as if he was aloof to such kind of human relationships. </p><p>He was too young only 24 yrs old. It was an age when boys usually roam around with girls and enjoy their life but he never did that. What happened suddenly?? He himself mentioned about grandfather\'s dream and indirectly confirmed that he is going to fullfill it. There must be only one reason, he must have taken liking to someone. Now everyone was curious.</p><p>Lu Qiang entered into his room, removed his jacket, tossed it on bed and entered in the bathroom. When he was standing in front of the mirror in the bathroom he touched the stains on his shirt and said, \"It seams like grandpa is going to jump with happiness soon.\" There was a pleasant smile on his face.</p><p>After getting fresh, Lu Qiang headed downstairs. Everyone was waiting for him at breakfast table eagerly, because of what he had said before. </p><p>It was a big wooden dining table, able to accommodate whole Lu family and few more guests too. Elder Lu was sitting on the chair at one end of the table, which meant for the head of the family. On his right side was sitting Lu Shuang, his second son and his wife. On left side Lu Jinhai and Lu Jiahui were sitting. </p><p>Lu Qiang was wearing a white shirt and blue pant with his suit\'s jacket in one hand. He was looking fresh after taking shower with hairs still quite damp but had no expressions on his face. Everyone was staring at him without blinking an eye, like never seen him before, remembering what he said back then. Nobody dared to ask anything but stare at him.</p><p>Lu Qiang walked towards dining table ignoring their gazes. He put his jacket on the back of the chair which was exactly opposite to elder Lu Huan, at the other end of dining table and sat down with a calm and compose expressions.</p><p>Atmosphere was silent as everyone was busy with making their own assumptions. There was only a sound of servants doing their work.</p><p>Table was filled with a delicious dishes like chicken steamed buns with soup, tofu pudding, rice noodles with meat, peanut butter chocolate smoothie with banana and flax, pancakes with eggs, wontons, tea and some fruits.</p><p>Servants served the dishes then everyone started to eat. As Lu Qiang was having a bite he sensed the gazes coming in his direction. He stopped and looked up in the direction of these curious sights. </p><p>Everyone was still looking at him observing his actions. As Lu Qiang looked up everyone got alarmed to their own actions and started to look here and there as if thief got caught while doing a deed. </p><p>Lu Qiang frowned, put his chopsticks on table which made a sound \"tthud\". He then leaned back in the chair, crossed his hands in front of his chest and passed his gaze across the table. Then he asked with serious tone \"Is there anything wrong?? Everyone shooked there head in a sync, as if they have practiced it.</p><p>Lu Shuang, \"No!! Not at all dear. It\'s.....it\'s just that you are looking very handsome today and we are happy for you.\"</p><p>Everyone nodded in an agreement.</p><p>Lu Jiahui: \"Yes!! Yes!!

I am!! since my birth.\"</p><p>Everyone: \"___\" (flattery don\'t work on him)</p><p>He continued and asked, \"Then what are you people happy about?\" He knew why everyone was behaving like that. So he just mocked their reasoning.</p><p>\"Haha!! That\'s true. You are really very handsome. After all you are my grandson\", Lu Huan said with a pride and tried to made him forget his question.</p><p>Others: \".....,\" (Never forgets to blow his own whistle) and looked at Lu Huan.</p><p>Lu Huan then continued, \"But you are looking quite weak to me. You should take care of your health to increase your stamina.\" </p><p>\"Stamina??\" As usual Everyone knew, where this conversation was heading now, so everyone just kept quiet.</p><p>Lu Huan then called the butler and said, \" From now on you will make all the nutritious food for Lu Qiang that will improve his health and stamina.\"</p><p>Butler was quite embarrassed, took a glance at Lu Qiang and nodded saying, \" Yes Master\".

He just decided to play along.</p><p>Everyone was used to the behaviour of elder Lu Huan but what surprised them most were the words they heard from Lu Qiang\'s mouth. He never talked this much and that to as shamelessly as his grandpa.</p><p>Lu Huan : \"I just want to make sure that, when a wild cat will cross your path in the future, you won\'t spill your coffee out.\" </p><p>\"Don\'t worry grandpa I know how to tame a wild cat so that I won\'t waste my coffee.\"</p><p>\"Wild cats?? Are they good enough??\"</p><p>\"Just need to tame properly. Can turn into a better form, than civilised one\"</p><p>\"Haha!!

Food is getting cold. Stop talking and concentrate on your breakfast.\" Lu Shuang\'s words were like a decree from a Queen, so everyone obediently started eating.</p><p>Suddenly they heard a footsteps, coming from living room towards the dining table. Everyone looked in the direction of the sound. A small figure entered into a dining room while running, stopped near Lu Qiang and hugged him tightly.</p><p>\"Elder brother!!\" A small figure said while hugging Lu Qiang. He looked at him with a bright smile and eyes sparkling like the bright stars in the night showing his inexplicable happiness.</p><p>Lu LiJun, was the second son of Lu Jinhai and the younger brother of Lu Qiang. He was the youngest and most loved member in the family as he was only 11 years old kid. </p><p>For Lu Qiang he had only three kinds of people in his life..</p><p>1st- Lu LiJun, 2nd- family members and 3rd- others..</p><p>Lu LiJun was the most important person in his life. Everyone knew how much he loved Lu LiJun!! His polite and soft voice, warmth in his eyes and the way he handle Lu LiJun was enough to prove that.</p><p>\"Lu LiJun!! Where have you been since morning??, Lu Qiang asked caressing his brother\'s cheeks with one hand and other hand on his shoulder. He was happy to see this little chipmunk. </p><p>\"I was with brother Lu Feng. We were giving food to the fishes in the garden\'s pond?\" He said with smile on his face but suddenly his expressions changed and he asked with sad face, \"Why didn\'t you came for my birthday?? I waited for you. Then he lowered his eyes and looked down towards the floor.</p><p>\"I know!! And I am really sorry that I couldn\'t make it to your birthday.\" Then Lu Qiang hugged him gently, made him sit on the chair next to him and said, \"Have your breakfast first then I\'ll show you something.\"</p><p>\"What\'s it? brother Lu Qiang.\" He asked curiously and sadness on his face started to disappear.</p><p>\"That\'s surprise!!\" Lu Qiang said with a smile and winked at his brother. Then started to fill his plate with food.</p><p>\"Wow!! surprise!!! My....My birthday gift??\" He asked with the hell lot of excitement.</p><p>\"Mmm..\" Lu Qiang nodded and said, \" Now finish your breakfast first.</p><p>Lu LiJun started to dig his breakfast as fast as he could, stuffing his mouth without living any space inside. He looked adorable with his mouth stuffed with a food like a squirrel.</p><p>Lu Qiang: \"Slow down, otherwise you will get indigestion.\" Then he gently patted his head with full admiration.</p><p>Lu Qiang\'s behaviour was very different when it comes to Lu LiJun. Anyone could see the different dimensions of his personality when he is with Lu LiJun, such as loving and caring Lu Qiang, angry Lu Qiang, happy Lu Qiang, worried Lu Qiang, Upset Lu Qiang, talkative Lu Qiang, A kiddo Lu Qiang and many more. Lu LiJun was able to pull out all these personalities from his ice cold elder brother.</p><p>He treated Lu LiJun more like his son than his younger brother. All the decisions regarding Lu LiJun were taken by Lu Qiang only. He always fulfilled his demands, whatever it might be. Lu Qiang always wanted everything best for him. Everyone was worried that his love might spoil Lu LiJun but Lu Qiang was that much careful, as he wanted his little brother to become a good person. He always made him understand what is right and what is wrong.</p><p>For Lu LiJun, he too loved Lu Qiang more than anyone else, even his parents were secondary for him. His whole world revolved around Lu Qiang.</p><p>\"What a beautiful sight to see!!\" Everyone heard the voice from door of dining room, when they were busy in witnessing this show of affection between two brothers. </p><p>Everyone looked at the source of voice. Lu Feng, the one more handsome man from Lu family came to the dining room.</p><p>\"When you heard that Lu Qiang is back, you forgot this brother and ran to meet him leaving me there alone. That\'s not fair.\" And walked towards Lu LiJun.</p><p>Lu LiJun looked up at him and blinked his eyes like an innocent bunny. As his mouth was stuffed he couldn\'t say a word.</p><p>Lu Feng looked at his round face looking cute because of his stuffed cheeks. He smiled and said, \"I\'ll pass it this once\". He looked at Lu Qiang, gave him small smile and sat on the chair besides his mother.</p><p>Lu Qiang smiled back and continued paying attention to Lu LiJun, asking him to slow down and eat less.

He was fine as long as this matter of great grandchildren was not related to him and nobody was evading his personal space.</p><p>Lu LiJun was unaware of the things being said around him. He looked at everyone with confused expressions, as their was a sudden chaos on the dining table. Then he looked at his brother who put a slice of meat in his dish saying, \"eat this\". He obeyed his brother quietly, ignored everything and started digging his food.</p><p>Lu Qiang then turned his gaze towards elder Lu Huan and said, \"Rest assured grandpa. I will make sure to prepare enough stock for you before I hit the dry bottom, so no need to drag my little brother in the bottomless pit of your greeds.\" He said with an expressionless face and a cold voice. Then he continued to pay attention to Lu LiJun again as nobody matters to him here more than his little brother.</p><p>This conversation between these bold grandpa and grandson made everyone hold their head with both the hands and press the pressure point on their temples, as if it was a breakfast with a menu, having only one dish in it, called \"SHOCK\".</p><p>Lu Shuang finally poked her husband and asked him to stop now. His every conversation started and ended with only one thing and that\'s \"great grandchildren\".</p><p>Then nobody talked and started eating their breakfast with full attention.

He didn\'t talk further with him and started walking upstairs with Lu LiJun. It didn\'t bother Lu Feng, as usual he turned and headed outside with his car keys. He was wearing peach coloured slim fit T-shirt with stylish black leather jacket and a black jeans with black shoes?</p><p>Everyone was familiar with Lu Qiang\'s behavior with Lu Feng so nobody paid much attention to it. Lu Feng\'s mother Lu Hui didn\'t like it but couldn\'t say anything because her son was at fault. Also she was quite scared of Lu Qiang as most of the people in the family do.</p><p>Lu Feng was Lu Qiang\'s second cousin. Lu Qiang didn\'t hate him but was annoyed with all the bad habits Lu Feng had. He was alcoholic and drug addict, didn\'t like to work, having bad company of Friends. Lu Qiang tried to divert his attention from these things by giving him few responsibilities in company but he always got disappointment in return. Finally he decided to give up on him.</p><p>Lu Feng didn\'t hate Lu Qiang either. It was just that, he was happy in his own world. It never bothered him what others said or how they behaved with him. He was just too ignorant to everything. Lu Feng was a bright Student with masters degree in accounts and finance but after completing his education he never tried to do anything for his career let alone giving attention in the family business. He just wanted to live a care free life. </p><p>Although having all these bad qualities, he always maintained the distance with women. There were lots of women who tried to make their way into the Lu family by seducing and climbing into Lu Feng\'s bed but he never entertained anyone.

At the end of the corridor there was a glass door which opened into quite a big balcony which was converted into a mini garden having different types of beautiful decorative plants and the four sitter coffee wooden coffee table in the centre.</p><p>1st room at the left of corridor belonged to Jiang YuYan and the 1st room at the right belonged to Jiang Yang. The remaining two rooms were for the guests. </p><p>As they reached upstairs and done knowing about their rooms Jiang Ruolan said, \"Everything you need is ready there in your rooms. If you need something call me.\" Both nodded and went to their rooms and Jiang Ruolan headed back downstairs to the kitchen.</p><p>When Jiang YuYan entered the room she saw that the interior of the room was according to her taste. It was not a typical girl room coloured in pink and having all the the girlish stuff in pink colour. It was completely opposite. The room was bright and colourful having all the fresh colours with white background. </p><p>She liked everything colorful and fresh. She believed life should be colourful not boring. The walls were dyed mostly in white colour having few big random colour patches at few places. The furniture had different coloured laminates with the outline of the white one. The curtains, bedsheets and pillow were in light green colour giving this white room a fresh look. Her room looked like a beautiful colourful painting with a white background.</p><p>In the centre of the room there was a queen size bed attched to the wall behind it with a bedside table with 2 drawers. The wardrobe was filled with the beautiful dresses, bags, accessories, cosmetics, footwears and all stuff she needed but what surprised her more was, the one side of wardrobe was filled only with her favourite type of clothing and that was different types of jeans, T-shirts and sneakers which her mother didn\'t like that much.</p><p>\"These people are trying very hard to please me.\" She mumbled. </p><p>But she didn\'t know the pandora box was not completely opened yet and she was going to get quite a big shock soon...!!</p><p></p>'),(323,14,'Chapter 14 The Day Of Surprises',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 14 The Day Of Surprises</h3><p></p><p>In Jiang Yang\'s room..</p><p>After he entered into his bedroom he checked each and every inch of that room and he was amazed to see how everything in the room was so perfect and what he exactly wanted.</p><p>\"Are they trying to bribe me or what?? Accepted!!! It\'s truly amazing!! Mom Dad I am on your side. Count me in..\" He said while jumping with the happiness.</p><p>The room was dyed with the light and dark shades of beige and brown metallic colour. His room was divided into two parts. One part was the resting area having a king size bed with the matching bedside table. A big wardrobe having everything he needed for, from the hair on his head to the nails on his toes. The other part was his favourite, which was meant for study. A study table beside a long glass window. A huge bookshelf which was made in crisscross pattern having all kind books he would like to read. The bathroom was luxurious with big bathtub and separate shower area with glass walls.</p><p>Besides this, there was one bonus that made him get mad with happiness and that was a beautiful guitar hanging on the wall opposite to the bed. It looked beautiful on the wall having a light brown metallic colour.</p><p>He wanted to take that guitar in his hand but 1st he thought to clean himself and then went to the room picking his clothes from wardrobe.</p><p>When he returned, he couldn\'t resist the temptation to take that guitar in his hands but when he did that, he heard a loud scream. He realise that it was Jiang YuYan\'s voice. He put the guitar down and headed outside to Jiang YuYan\'s room in hurry having worried expressions on his face.</p><p>_______ _________</p><p> Jiang YuYan\'s room...</p><p>After checking her wardrobe, Jiang YuYan took her clothes and went to bathroom for bath. When she entered inside she saw luxurious bathroom with bathtub. The bathroom shelf was filled with all the products she liked to use.</p><p>\"So they don\'t want to give me any chance to complain. No wonder mom is a head of management and planning department. Not bad huuu!!\" She said while observing the stuff inside the shelf.</p><p>After having a bath Jiang YuYan came out of the bathroom in a purple bathrobe and stood infront of a big oval mirror, long enough to accommodate the whole figure of the person standing infront of it and was fixed in the wooden stand on the floor. When she was observing herself in the mirror she noticed there was one more door on the opposite wall few metres away from the bed. She turned and moved towards that door. When she opened the door she was shocked and screamed her throat out, with her eyes wide opened, about to pop out from their sockets. She then covered her mouth with her hands. </p><p>Jiang yang entered in her room as fast as he could. When he saw her standing at the door inside, he went there feeling worried and asked, \"what happened?? Are you....aaaaaaaaa!!!\" He stopped in between after looking inside the room and screamed his throat out just like Jiang YuYan. He stood still at the entrance of the room, besides Jiang YuYan. Both were looking inside of the room like someone had hypnotized them.</p><p>Just then the room\'s door opened and their parents entered inside in hurry to check what happened. When they saw these two standing at the entrance of that room, they understood what exactly might have happened.</p><p>________ __________ _____</p><p>At Lu mansion...</p><p>\"Elder brother I am excited to see my birthday gift? What did you brought?? Tell me.\" Lu LiJun said while jumping with the excitement. Lu Qiang just replied with smile as he was pleased and busy in admiring this little jumping Jack. He could do anything to see the glimpse of happiness on his little brother\'s face.</p><p>They walked upstairs to Lu Qiang\'s room which was at the end of corridor at 1st floor. As they reached at the door, Lu LiJun opened the door and dashed inside his brother\'s room. Lu Qiang followed him. As he entered the room Lu LiJun satrted to search for his gift here and there. Lu Qiang stopped him and asked to sit on the couch. Then he moved to the huge wardrobe in his luxurious room.</p><p>Lu Qiang\'s room was one of the best and specious room in the mansion. The room was not colourful but it was neat, clean and classy. Everything in the room was in white and silver grey colour. On the right side of the room there was a king size white bed with silver grey coloured bedding attached to the wall which was in silver grey while other walls were in white colour A bedside table having a wooden frame with the pic of both siblings. There was a soft silver grey carpet on the floor around the bed.</p><p>The wall opposite to the entrance and on the right side of the bed had huge glass windows and a glass door to enter into the balcony. Windows had silver grey curtains which went good with white coloured walls. There were few small abstract paintings that too had silver grey frames hanging on the walls with white colour. There was a white couch with silver grey cushions at the right side of the entrance. At the left side of the room, the wall opposite to bed had a quite a big wardrobe and a bathroom.</p><p>He opened the wardrobe and took out the medium sized box covered with attractive red gift wrapping paper. He then passed it to Lu Qiang saying, \" here it is\" and sat on the other end of the couch leaning back with his one hand on the handrest.</p><p>Lu LiJun took the box, placed it in the space between his brother and him and started to unwrap with the excitement.</p><p>When he opened the box and saw the gift he couldn\'t stop jumping from his sit.</p><p>\"Woooaaa... it\'s a latest gaming beast. This is one of the high end device in the world. Every gamer dream of it. I loved it too too much elder brother.\" He then kept the laptop on couch and pounced on his brother to hug him saying, \"Thank you so much. I am too happy.

Thank you so much\" he pulled his sister aside, copied her words and hugged his parents??</p><p>Jiang YuYan: \"Hey!! what are you thanking for? This is my room. Why are you being such a drama queen?\"</p><p>Jiang Yang : \"I am thanking them for my room, little cry baby!!\".</p><p>She frowned with the word cry baby and said, \"Who are you calling cry baby? You are such a drama queen and what\'s with that scream earlier??</p><p>Jiang Yang : \"You screamed too. When I saw the scenario inside this room, I thought that screaming might be the proper reaction to express myself just like you. Now tell me who is the real drama queen?\" He said while teasing her.</p><p>\"You....\"</p><p>Jiang Peizhi : \"let\'s get inside\" and cut these two in between their argument.</p><p>Everyone went inside. The room was spacious brightened with the sunlight coming from the glass wall of that room. The room was white with one wall having a big shelfs filled with all types of painting colours. There were various wooden stands with the canvas attached to it, all kind painting brushes, aprons, glows, a wooden chair to sit while painting and a resting area. Because of the glass wall in the room one could see everything that\'s outside. The bottom of the wall decorated with small decorative plants from the outside to give it a feel of natural greenary. The room was perfect, that any artist out there would love it.</p><p>Jiang YuYan was a bright Student, she could have done good in any field like medical or engineering but she chose to paint.</p><p>When she was young she traveled along with her parents to different countries which were famous for its art culture like Greece, France, Italy and other European countries. She was mesmerized with the beautiful paintings from the legends.</p><p>She planned to visit and travel all over the world and to portray everything in her paintings. Out of all the places she traveled with her parents, she liked Greece alot and planned to settle there. When she was in New York, she often used to spend her time by visiting the painting exhibitions by different artists. Her favourite place was \"The Painting Centres\", a non profitable art gallery which provides opportunities for emerging, mid career and established artists.</p><p>\"Mom, I thought you want me to just study here. But this...\" She couldn\'t find the words to express her feelings.</p><p>\"How can I keep you away from what you want to do? Keep doing it and about studying business management you can just do it on a side.\" </p><p>Both Jiang Peizhi and Jiang Ruolan were aware that Jiang YuYan was quite unhappy about coming to China. They wanted her to keep painting as it was what she wanted to do since she was young so they prepared everything here for her. About business management course she would be able to do it with ease as she was extremely talented.</p><p>After that everyone went downstairs for the delicious breakfast made by Jiang Ruolan herself. Jiang family finished their breakfast and was sitting in the living area infront of television. After quite a long time they were together so there was a lot of stuff to talk about.

I mean yes...yes, you are right elder brother.\" He answered with a forced smile on his face. This sudden question from his elder brother startled him and it took a while for him to process it. Then he thought \'Why are you dragging me in this elder brother? I am having bad feelings about it\'.</p><p>Lu Huan : \"Is that so??\" Then he continued. \"Then I\'ll give both of you the other ones as it is not that late to give it to you now. I guess Both of you will be able to use it quite a sometime.\"</p><p>When these people were talking, Lu Qiang opened the white paper packet and saw inside. There was a book which looked quite old. He was taking that book out but slipped it back inside in hurry after seeing just the 1/4th part of the cover on it.</p><p>He then pinched the space between his eyebrows with the fingers of his left hand while holding a white paper packet in his right hand, having annoyed expressions on his face with his eyes closed.

He looked at his grandson and asked, \"What? Did you like it? I knew you would. Haha!!\" He continued talking without giving him a chance to reply back. He had a big smile on his face as he couldn\'t see Lu Qiang\'s vexed reaction.</p><p>When Lu Qiang was taking that book out, he saw the word \"FANGZHONGSHU\" written at the top side of its cover. He slipped it back in hurry inside the packet and couldn\'t help but grit his teeths \'This perverted old man\'.

Not just you but also he doesn\'t look like mother. I always wonder, he took after whom in our family?\" She said with the face full of questions.</p><p>Lu Chen : \"__\" (what\'s with this sudden question). He then touched his face and thought \'Really?\'</p><p>After hearing this, the expressions on elder Lu Huan and Elder Lu Shuang\'s faces suddenly changed. They looked startled and couldn\'t say a word but to look at each other.</p><p>Lu Jinhai : \"Ohhhh!!!Lu Chen? He...He took after our great grandfather.\" He said in hurry after watching his parents startled faces.</p><p>Lu Hui : \"Really?\" Said with an expressions with want to know more.</p><p>Lu Jinhai : \"Yes!! He is just like him. A good son and a brother. Great grandfather was really a nice person.\"</p><p>Lu Huan recovered from his daze and said after clearing his throat, \"I am glad that one of my son took after my grandfather.\"</p><p>Lu Chen : \"__\" (smile... smile)</p><p>Lu Hui : \"That\'s really good to hear\" and smiled.</p><p>Lu Qiang observed his father\'s and grandparent\'s reaction.

He understood that he must have observed their quite an uncomfortable behaviour. Lu Qiang was very smart in this aspect just like his father. Nothing unusual could pass their sights which is why both of them were very successful in the business and handling the people, specifically the trouble makers.</p><p>Lu Qiang looked at his father with neutral face and didn\'t gave any reaction as indicating he didn\'t know what was going on. Then he looked at his watch and said, \"Father, I am going to office now. I am already very late. Though I have informed Xio Min to handle everything, I really need to go now.\" Then he and Lu Chen left for the office in their cars. Lu Jinhai told them that he will be there for the other half of the day.</p><p>Elder Lu Huan and Lu Shuang left for their room. Lu Hui was talking to Lu Jiahui. </p><p>Lu Jinhai : \"I have something to discuss with father and mother about tomorrow\'s event so I\'ll be in their room.\" He said to his wife who in response smiled and said, \"ok\".</p><p>Elder Lu\'s room was on the ground floor unlike everyone\'s room on 1st and 2nd floor. It\'s because of the problem in Lu Shuang\'s knees and also because she liked the garden around the balcony of that room. Through the balcony she had a direct access to that garden and could go there any time.</p><p>Lu Jinhai reached to his parent\'s room and knocked the door. When he entered the room he saw his mother was sitting on the chair silently while his father elder Lu Huan was standing in front of a glass window in his room, staring blankly outside without any expressions with his hands tucked inside his pants pocket. </p><p>It was his habbit to stand like this alone and keep staring blankly at a distance, whenever he couldn\'t think about anything. He looked very different from his usual playful and blantant personality as if he was wearing a mask on his face. This side of Lu Huan was only known to his wife and his elder son Lu Jinhai.</p><p>Lu Jinhai : \"I knew, both of you would be like this when I\'ll come to your room.\" He said calmly while sitting in the chair next to his mother. Then he took his mother\'s hand in his and asked with a gentle voice, \"Mother!! What are you thinking? You know, there is nothing to be worried about.\"</p><p>Lu Shuang : \"I am worried about your father and the promise he made back then.\" She said holding her son\'s hand and looking at him with hurtful expressions.</p><p>\"Father!!\", Lu Jinhai looked at his father and called him but there was no response. Lu Jinhai didn\'t bother him again and looked at his mother back. This side of Lu Huan was quite frightening for them, as one could see the coldness around him. No one could imagine there is this side of mischievously naughty and talkative elder Lu Huan. Withoutng a single word he can make a person in front of him tremble on his two feet.</p><p>\"No one should ever know about this!!\" After few moments Lu Shuang and Lu Jinhai heard these commanding words from Lu Huan. Both of them looked back to Elder Lu Huan but he was still in the same position as before, staring outside of the window.</p><p>Lu Jinhai : \"Rest assured father. I\'ll take this secret to my grave.\" He then calmed his mother down and took a leave without talking much.</p><p>______ _____ ____</p><p>At Jiang residence....</p><p>Jiang Yang was reading a news paper and Jiang YuYan was searching something online on her laptop in the living room, while their parents were busy with their work in the study.</p><p>\"Hey little sis!!

I have already faced today\'s most exciting thing in my life in the morning, that\'s my art room and I don\'t have anything valuables to get stolen?\" She said with an annoyed tone.</p><p>\"So you were listening and I thought you were not interested\". He said looking at her with his one eyebrow angled up.</p><p>\"You keep buzzing in my ear like a mosquito so how can I avoid it?\"</p><p>\"Who knows, you might face thief and he will steal something from you.

If she want she could have bought that dress but she had enough of everything that day and was too tired to do anything.</p><p>Then her gaze fell to her right side on the familiar figure who was also looking in her direction.

Actually it was not just a simple smile but he was showing all his perl white teeths and it was the first time ever they saw this eye catching and beautiful view.</p><p></p>'),(333,14,'Chapter 24 My First Kiss got Stolen',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 24 My First Kiss got Stolen...</h3><p></p><p>\"Boss, did something happened?.\" Finally Xio Min gathered a courage and asked him.</p><p>\"Cough**cough\" Lu Qiang cleared his throat after realising that these two were observing him through the rear view mirror. He then answered with his usual poker face expressions, \"Nothing. Just thinking about something.\"</p><p>\"Is there something to worry about?\" Xio min knew this question was useless because his boss was smiling ear to ear. There must be something good, whatever he was thinking about. But he couldn\'t ask him directly so he twisted his question. </p><p>\"No!!\" It was a reply in a firm voice. </p><p>As Xio min and the driver thought that this topic had ended with this \"No\", Lu Qiang said something again which surprised them.</p><p>\"Just thinking about repaying a kindness.\" He then opened his file back and started to go through the documents again. </p><p>Xio Min didn\'t expect his boss to speak further after getting his reply as strong \"No\", but he got surprised to hear that his boss spoke total five words after that single \"No\". Even the driver was surprised. Xio Min didn\'t dare to ask anything again, thinking his boss\'s quota of words for today is over and smiled.</p><p>_____________ _______</p><p>Jiang YuYan was waiting for her brother in a car near the intersection. It\'s been half an hour since she was waiting and he didn\'t come back. She was feeling tired and was about to call him, there was a knock on the window. It was her brother. He came back with a shopping bag in his hand. Driver unlocked the door from inside for him. Jiang Yang put the bag in his hand at the front passenger seat and sat next to his sister on back passenger seat. Driver started the car and they moved to go back to their home.</p><p>\"What\'s in that bag.\" She asked while looking at the bag on front passenger seat.</p><p>\"A surprise for you.\" He said and winked at her with a smile.</p><p>\"For me??\" She asked with a surprised expressions.</p><p>He laughed and said, \"Don\'t get too excited. I am just kidding. There are undergarments for me.\"</p><p>\"Uurggg\" She just frowned and looked outside the window.</p><p>\"What?? Do you want to see? I don\'t mind it. Those are quite sexy.\" He said as pretending to take that shopping bag from the front seat.</p><p>She didn\'t replied him back and thought \'Why all these men don\'t mind to show anything related to their lower body? Shameless!!\' Then she closed her eyes and started to take a nap. When they reached at home it was almost 6.30pm. Both were tired, went to their rooms and got fresh. After getting fresh Jiang YuYan went to the bed as she was too tired.</p><p>________ __________</p><p>At Lu mansion...at 7 pm...</p><p>Lu Qiang arrived late at home. He was busy with a work which was waiting for him since the whole week so he stayed in his office even after the office hours.</p><p>When Lu Qiang reached inside the living room, two figures came towards him and said, \"Brother Lu Qiang we are back.\"</p><p>Lu Qiang looked at them, smiled and asked, \"How was your trip?\"</p><p>Those were the Lu Qiang\'s younger sisters Lu Lian and Lu Bao.</p><p>Lu Bao was Lu Qiang\'s Cousin and Lu Chen\'s daughter. Lu Bao was a year younger to Lu Lian. Both were on a trip with their freinds as it was a summer vacations. Lu Bao was quite talkative as compared to Lu Lian and both shared a very good relation with each other as best buddies..</p><p>Lu Lian : \"It was awesome!!\"</p><p>Lu Bao: \"Yes!! It was the best ever vacation we had. How are you? Haven\'t you missed us?\"</p><p>Lu Qiang : \"I did!!\"</p><p>\"Hey!! Let him take a breath first. He just came back from the office.\" It was Lu Han with his wife Lu Xiu.</p><p>Lu Han : \"How are you Lu Qiang?\"</p><p>Lu Qiang : \"Good!! When did you arrive?\"</p><p>Lu Han : \"Just a while ago.\"</p><p>Lu Han was the elder cousin of Lu Qiang and his uncle Lu Chen\'s elder son. He was handling the business from their ancestral town in place of his father Lu Chen. Few years back when elder Lu Huan called Lu Chen to the city, as he wanted to live with his two sons around him. At that time the responsibility of the factory and the business around that whole area went to his elder son Lu Han. That was the origin of Lu corporation and that business was very important so it was necessary that someone from the family should be there to handle it.</p><p>\"Brother Lu Qiang, you are back\" As Lu LiJun saw his brother, he came running towards him. Lu Qiang just patted his head with a smile.</p><p>See what our sisters brought for me?? A dream catcher! Now I won\'t get any bad dreams. Isn\'t it nice? He said with a smile while holding a colourful threaded dream catcher in his hands.</p><p>\"Indeed\" He replied and said, \"I need to get fresh so I am going to my room. I\'ll catch you after some time.</p><p>Lu LiJun nodded and said, \"Grandpa has called everyone to the garden so I am going there\"</p><p>\"Ok!! I\'ll be there soon.\" Lu Qiang headed to his room and others to the garden.</p><p>_____ _____</p><p>At Jiang residence..</p><p>Jiang YuYan was lying on her bed with her eyes closed. She remembered the incident in front of a washroom of that restaurant. She reminded the words said by the man while touching the corner of his lips. She got up and sat in the bed touching her lips. </p><p>\"What was that?? I just had my first kiss? How can that be?\"</p><p>She frowned and held her head in both the hands. After watching that man in a pain she almost forgot about it and later because of the bold attitude of that man and her brother Jiang Yang, she was too angry to think about anything. Now as she was having a rest, she recalled that incident again.</p><p>\"My first kiss!! Happened just like this and that too with the stranger.\" She was stunned after drawing this conclusion and lied back in the bed on her stomach. She started hitting and kicking the mattress as she threw a quilt and the pillows on the floor and cried while clutching her hairs with her hands, \"My first kiss!! My first kiss got stolen.\"</p><p></p>'),(334,14,'Chapter 25 I Will Love And Care For Her Too',_binary '<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chapter 25 I Will Love And Care For Her Too!!</h3><p></p><p>At lu mansion.. 7.30 pm.....</p><p>Whole family was present in the garden of the mansion. The garden was specious and beautiful with various beautiful flowering and decorative plants. There was a small water fall at the one corner of the garden decorated with rocks and statues. In the centre there was a patio surrounded by circular fish pond and having a small wooden bridge attached to it.</p><p>Everyone was sitting on the chairs arranged in a circle with a wooden circular tea table in the centre. They were chatting happily sipping an evening tea. All the family members were together like this after a long time except for Lu Qiang and Lu Feng. It was a Saturday so everyone was relaxed. They were discussing about the event on next day. </p><p>Lu Jinhai : \"How\'s everything going on there in the factory?</p><p>Lu Han : \"Everything is good as usual\"</p><p>\"Did I call you people to talk about your work here? Leave your business back in the office before coming to home.\" It was Elder Lu Huan frowning at them.</p><p>This time everyone was present at home including Lu Han and his wife Lu Xiu, elder Lu Huan wanted to spend a time with whole family together as it was quite rare to happen.</p><p>\"Sorry father. We were just....\" Lu Jinhai couldn\'t continue further when he looked at frowning Lu Huan.</p><p>\"How was your trip my beautiful grand daughters?\" Lu Huan asked while looking at his two grand daughters, ignoring his son.</p><p>\"It was fantastic grandpa.. Shanghai was awesome. There we went to....\"</p><p>When they were chatting Lu LiJun saw that Lu Qiang was coming in their direction. He got up and ran towards him.</p><p>\"You know brother? Just now Grandpa scolded father and elder cousin..hehe..you should have come sooner to see their faces.\"</p><p>Lu Qiang just replied with smile and continued walking along with him towards the sitting area.</p><p>Lu Lian and Lu Bao gave short summary of their trip to grandpa and strated discussing about their preparation for the event like what they were going to wear and all. Suddenly Lu Lian looked in the direction of these two brothers coming towards them.</p><p>Lu Lian : Don\'t you think Brother Lu Qiang is too handsome? She said in a very low pitch that only Lu Bao could hear what she said.</p><p>Lu Bao : \"Not just handsome but damn sexy.\" She said following Lu Lian\'s sight.</p><p>Lu Lian : \"I wonder, how many girls would have been head over heels for him\"</p><p>Lu Bao : \"I am sure all of them must have had crazy nights thinking about him.\" </p><p>Lu Lian : \"Haha!! You are right, but it\'s not good to talk about our Brother like this.\"</p><p>Lu Bao : \"He is our brother that\'s why we have a right to talk anything about him.\"</p><p>Lu Bao looked in their direction again and said, \"Look at Lu LiJun He looks just like brother Lu Qiang. We are going to have one more handsome brother as he took after brother Lu Qiang\" She replied with same low pitch.</p><p>\"But I am feeling like you took after your grandfather. Bold and blantant!! It was Lu Bao\'s mother Lu Hui,who was sitting just beside her. Lu Hui heard everything that Lu Bao said and was not happy about it.</p><p>\"Cough**cough\" Both Lu Bao and Lu Lian kept quiet after what Lu Hui said, like a thieves got caught red handed.</p><p>Lu Qiang and Lu Lijun reached to the sitting area. Both sat next to each other. Lu Huan was discussing about the event\'s arrangement with his sons. When he saw Lu Qiang, he stopped talking, looked at Lu Qiang and said, \"After tomorrow\'s event I want one more big event to celebrate in our family.\"</p><p>Everyone thought, now there was going to be another great grandchildren discussion but they were wrong.</p><p>Lu Huan : \"I want you to get married soon.\"</p><p>Lu Qiang : \"Cough**cough!! M.. Marriage.\"</p><p>Everyone : \"___\" (wow.. marriage!! Finally he talked something good and meaningful...Count us in)</p><p>Everyone was happy except for Lu Qiang and Lu Lijun. Lu Qiang was shocked and Lu Lijun was quite angry.</p><p>Lu Jinhai : \"For tomorrow\'s we have invited all the reputed and and noble family\'s in the city. Most of the families have beautiful and educated girls. See, if you find someone suitable for you.\" He said being totally satisfied with his father\'s words.</p><p>Lu Jiahui : \"Grandpa is right. You should think about having a family now.\"</p><p>With this sentence from Lu Jiahui everyone nodded and started to ask him to get married.</p><p>Lu Qiang got annoyed with this sudden marriage thing raised by everyone. He said, \"Grandpa till morning you were behind me, to give you great grandchildren and now what\'s with this sudden marriage thing.\" Because of this sudden demand from his Grandpa out of the blue, he was shocked that he didn\'t realise what he just said and gave Grandpa another chance to mock him down.</p><p>\"So you are okay to give me great grandchildren but don\'t want to get married. Am I right?\"</p><p>Lu Qiang : \"W..what? When did I say that?\"</p><p>Others : \"___\" (poor guy got caught in elder Lu\'s claws)</p><p>\"In the morning, you agreed to fullfill my wish to have great grandchildren, so I thought marriage would be good before that. But if you don\'t want it, I am happy to settle with only having great grandchildren.\"</p><p>Before Lu Qiang could say anything, Lu LiJun frowned and asked, \"Are you really going to marry?\"</p><p>\"No! I am not. Don\'t pay attention to Grandpa.\"</p><p>\"But what if you got married. I know you will love your wife and won\'t pay attention to me.\"</p><p>\"If I got married, then you will get one more person to love you. She would be the one to love you and care for you just like me.\"</p><p>\"Really?? </p><p>\"Yes!!!\" Lu Qiang said in a firm voice</p><p>\"Ok!! Then I\'ll love her and care for her too, always!!\" Lu Lijun said with a big smile on his face.</p><p>\"Good\"</p><p>\"Yes!! that\'s a promise.\"</p><p>Everyone was glad to see that Lu LiJun was happy, because they knew Lu Qiang would never do anything that could upset Lu Lijun. So to make him get married, Lu LiJun\'s permission was necessary.</p><p></p>');
